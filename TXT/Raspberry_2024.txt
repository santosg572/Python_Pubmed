    "abstract": "There has been incremental progress in moving BCI out of the laboratory environment and into the homes of those who would benefit most, especially children living with severe physical disabilities. Practical issues, such as available computational resources and long calibration times, have slowed down the adoption of such systems. To develop an efficient and scalable machine learning framework consistent with early approaches that facilitate at-home BCI use, this study provides valuable insights into measuring the behavioral characteristics of a Raspberry Pi 4 (RPi4) during the operation and execution of standard BCI processes, including the training and evaluation of classifier models. The results, which evaluated ten standard classifiers, including the Riemannian Geometry (RG) framework and more advanced deep learning approaches like Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were profiled on RPi4. These were compared to Desktop and MacBook computations for metrics such as training time, inference time, peak memory, and incremental memory usage, with computational bottlenecks identified. Our assessment revealed comparable performance metrics (84.3% of accuracy, recall, and f1_score, and 84.7% precision) for the neural network models despite the lower computational resources. Profiling results, including 1.74 sec training time, 0.405 sec inference time, 1154.9 MiB peak memory, and 405.2 MiB incremental memory usage, also demonstrated that the RPi4 is a potentially viable device for low-cost BCI systems. However, high-resource demanding classifiers such as ANN may need to be carefully considered in their implementation, which, in turn, will scale down the potential cost and complexity of adopting practical, impactful at-home BCI systems.",

    "abstract": "Cancer remains a major global health challenge, with significant disparities in access to advanced diagnostic and prognostic technologies, especially in resource-constrained settings. Existing medical treatments and devices for cancer diagnosis are often prohibitively expensive, limiting their reach and impact. Pathologists' scarcity exacerbates cancer diagnosis accuracy, elevating mortality risks. To address these critical issues, this study presents OVision - a low cost, deep learning-powered framework developed to assist in histopathological diagnosis. The key objective is to leverage the portable, low-power computing Raspberry Pi. By designing standalone devices that eliminate the need for internet connectivity and high-end infrastructure, we can dramatically reduce costs while maintaining accuracy. As a proof of concept, the study demonstrated the viability of this framework through a compact, self-contained device capable of accurately detecting ovarian cancer subtypes with 95% accuracy, on par with traditional methods, while costing a small fraction of the price. This portable, off-grid solution has immense potential to improve access to precision cancer diagnostics, especially in underserved regions of the world that lack the resources to deploy expensive, infrastructure-heavy medical technologies. In addition, by classifying each tile, the tool can provide percentages of each histologic subtype detected within the slide. This capability enhances the diagnostic precision, offering a detailed overview of the heterogeneity within each tissue sample, helps in understanding the complexity of histologic subtypes and tailoring personalized treatment plans. In conclusion, this work proposes a transformative model for developing affordable, accessible medical devices that can bring advanced healthcare benefits to all, laying the foundation for a more equitable, inclusive future of precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the limitations of linear mapping in two-dimensional gimbal control for moving target tracking, which results in significant control errors and slow response times. To overcome these issues, we propose a nonlinear mapping control method that enhances the success rate of light source target tracking systems. Using Raspberry Pi 4B and OpenCV, the control system performs real-time recognition of rectangular frames and laser spot images. The tracking system, which includes an OpenMV H7 Plus camera, captures and processes the laser spot path. Both systems are connected to an STM32F407ZGT6 microcontroller to drive a 42-step stepper motor with precise control. By adjusting the parameter c of the nonlinear mapping curve, we optimize the\u00a0system's\u00a0performance, balancing the response speed and stability. Our results show a significant improvement in control accuracy, with a miss rate of 3.3%, an average error rate of 0.188% at 1.25 m, and a 100% success rate in target tracking. The proposed nonlinear mapping control method offers substantial advancements in real-time tracking and control systems, demonstrating its potential for broader application in intelligent control fields.",

    "abstract": "Based on a non-targeted metabolomic approach, a comprehensive analysis of the metabolic profiles of two raspberry cultivars, Selina (TSM) and Tulameen (CSM), was conducted to explore the potential for further processing of these two varieties. A total of 752 metabolites were identified in both raspberry varieties, with 375 metabolites detected in negative ion mode and additional metabolites identified in positive ion mode. The total number of differential metabolites between TSM and CSM was 62, with orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) revealing that the main differential metabolites between the two varieties were phenolic compounds, organic acids, and alkaloids. KEGG pathway analysis identified the top three significantly different metabolic pathways as biosynthesis of amino acids; valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis; and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. In conclusion, this study comprehensively analyzed the metabolic characteristics of TSM and CSM raspberry varieties, providing valuable insights and revealing their potential application prospects. Compared to previous studies, this research provides new insights into the metabolic differences between TSM and CSM cultivars, specifically highlighting newly identified metabolites that were not reported before. These findings include novel differences in phenolic compounds and alkaloids, which play important roles in plant stress response and have potential health benefits. This enhances our understanding of the unique properties of each cultivar and underscores the biological functions of the newly identified metabolites, contributing to the broader field of functional food development.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. H. pylori infection and overweight have been implicated in AD via the gut-brain axis (GBA). This study aimed to determine whether supplementation of BRBs has a meaningful effect on H. pylori infection, overweight, and AD development in a clinical trial setting. We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with mild clinical dementia who also had H. pylori infection and were overweight. The study was conducted over 10 weeks, consisting of an 8-week intervention period (25\u2009g powder of black raspberries, BRBs, or placebo twice daily, morning and evening) and a 2-week follow-up. The primary outcomes were changes in Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Urea Breath Test (UBT), and Body Mass Index (BMI). Consumption of BRBs improved cognitive functions (p\u2009<\u20090.00001), compared to the placebo group (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Besides, BRBs ingestion decreased H. pylori infection and BMI (p\u2009<\u20090.00001 and p\u2009<\u20090.05 respectively) while the placebo group stayed statistically the same (p\u2009=\u20090.98 and p\u2009=\u20090.25 respectively). BRBs significantly decreased inflammatory markers, improved oxidative index, and adiponectin (p\u2009<\u20090.05) compared to the placebo group, while adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and leptin did not significantly change. BRBs modulated the abundance of several fecal probiotics, particularly, Akkermansia muciniphila. Our results provided that BRBs suppressed H. pylori infection, decreased BMI, and rebalanced the gut microbiome, which could improve cognitive functions in mild dementia patients. Longer and larger randomized clinical trials of BRB interventions targeting H. pylori infection, overweight, or mild dementia are warranted to confirm the results from this pilot trial.

    "abstract": "Cultivated raspberries (Rubus idaeus L.) most commonly bear small, red, highly aromatic fruits. Their colour is derived predominantly from anthocyanins, water soluble polyphenolic pigments, but as well as red forms, there exist cultivars that display yellow- and apricot-coloured fruits. In this investigation, we used a multi-omics approach to elucidate the genetic basis of the apricot fruit colour in raspberry. Using metabolomics, we quantified anthocyanins in red and apricot raspberry fruits and demonstrated that, in contrast to red-fruited raspberries, fruits of the apricot cultivar 'Varnes' contain low concentrations of only a small number of anthocyanin compounds. By performing RNASeq, we revealed differential expression patterns in the apricot-fruited 'Varnes' for genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway and following whole genome sequencing using long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing, we identified a CACTA-like transposable element (TE) in the second exon of the Anthocyanidin synthase (Ans) gene that caused a truncated predicted ANS protein. PCR confirmed the presence in heterozygous form of the transposon in an unrelated, red-fruited cultivar 'Veten', indicating apricot fruit colour is recessive to red and that it may be widespread in raspberry germplasm, potentially explaining why apricot forms appear at regular intervals in modern raspberry breeding populations.",

    "abstract": "In this study, biodegradable and active films based on sodium alginate incorporated with different concentrations of oils (25% and 50%) from fruit seeds were developed for potential applications in food packaging. The ultraviolet and visible (UV-VIS) spectra of raspberry seed oil (RSO) and black currant seed oil (BCSO) indicated differences in bioactive compounds, such as tocopherols, phenolic compounds, carotenoids, chlorophyll, and oxidative status (amounts of dienes, trienes, and tetraenes) of active components added to alginate films. The study encompassed the color, structure, and thermal stability analysis of sodium alginate films incorporated with RSO and BCSO and their mixtures. The color of alginate films before and after the addition of oils from both fruit seeds was evaluated by measuring color coordinates in the CIELab color space: L* (lightness), a* (red-green), and b* (yellow-blue). The lightness values ranged between 94.21 and 95.08, and the redness values varied from -2.20 to -2.65, slightly decreasing for the films enriched with oils. In contrast, yellowness values ranged between 2.93 and 5.80 for the obtained active materials, significantly increasing compared to the control alginate film (L* = 95.48, a* = -1.92, and b* = -0.14). Changes in the structure and morphology of the alginate films after incorporating bioactive-rich oils were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Films with RSO and oil mixtures had more developed surfaces than films with BCSO. Moreover, the cross-sections of the films with RSO showed holes evenly distributed inside the films, indicating traces of volatile compounds. Thermal decomposition of the alginate films loaded with oils showed five separate stages (to 125 \u00b0C, 125-300 \u00b0C, 310-410 \u00b0C, 410-510 \u00b0C, and 750-1000 \u00b0C, respectively) related to the oil and surfactant decomposition. The shape of the thermogravimetric curves did not depend on the oil type. The added oils reduced the efficiency of alginate decomposition in the first stage. The obtained results showed that new functional and thermally stable food packaging films based on sodium alginate with a visual appearance acceptable to consumers could be produced by utilizing oils from fruit seed residues.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is a renowned fruit plant with significant medicinal value. Its nuclear genome and chloroplast genome (plastome) have been reported, while there is a lack of genetic information on its mitogenome. We sequenced and assembled the complete mitogenome of R. idaeus, and conducted a series of genetic investigations comparing it with the nuclear and chloroplast genomes, so as to better gain a comprehensive understanding of the species' genetic background.\nThe mitogenome is represented by one circular chromosome of 438,947\u00a0bp. Twenty-four core genes, nine variable genes, 26 tRNAs, and three rRNAs were annotated. A total of 52 SSRs and 38 tandem repeat sequences were identified. 533 pairs of dispersed repeats were detected, among which three pairs were found to have mediated the homologous recombination, resulting in one major conformation and seven minor conformations. Furthermore, 52 homologous sequences between the mitogenome and plastome were identified, including six complete protein-coding genes and 12 tRNA genes. We also detected 828 homologous fragments between the nuclear genome and mitogenome, including one trnM-CAU gene.\nIn this study, we presented the mitogenome of R. idaeus for the first time based on data obtained from Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing platforms. Key characteristics of the mitogenome were examined, including its gene composition, repetitive elements, and homologous DNA fragments. Additionally, we identified multiple recombination events in the mitogenome mediated by repetitive sequences The high-quality and well-annotated mitogenome for the known fruit red raspberry will provide essential genetic information for species classification, evolution analysis, and even genetic improvement in Rubus in the future.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effects of raspberry ketone on hypothalamic inflammation and its mechanism. Mouse microglia cells (BV2 cells) were cultured in vitro with palmitic acid (100 \u03bcM) to induce inflammation model and then incubated with raspberry ketone (5, 20, 50 \u03bcM) alone or raspberry ketone (50 \u03bcM) and the specific inhibitor of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), genipin (10 \u03bcM), to test the role of UCP2 in raspberry ketone regulatory of inflammation. Meanwhile, C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet containing raspberry ketone (0.2%, wt/wt) for 16 wk or 7 d to observe the effects of raspberry ketone on the body weights and hypothalamic inflammation of mice. The expression levels of inflammatory factors, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), were detected using RT-qPCR, Elisa, and Western blotting, respectively. At the cellular level, raspberry ketone reduced the content of inflammatory factors in BV2 cells and in the cell culture medium. Genipin inhibited the anti-inflammatory effect of raspberry ketone on BV2 cells. At the animal level, after 16 wk of feeding, raspberry ketone-containing diets significantly reduced the body weight of mice, but had no significant effect on the mRNA expression level of hypothalamic inflammatory factors. On the other hand, 7 d of raspberry ketone gavage significantly reduced mRNA and protein expression of hypothalamic inflammatory factors. The results of this study suggest that raspberry ketone could regulate high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice, and the specific mechanism may be to inhibit hypothalamic inflammation in mice by regulating UCP2 gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberries, valued for their nutrients and bioactive compounds, have broad uses in processing and healthy products. However, limited comprehensive research focused on the comparison of phenolic compounds of red raspberry, especially species cultivated in Northeast China, has been reported. This study aimed to conduct a thorough investigation of 24 red raspberry varieties in Northeast China for the first time, evaluating their phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacities. The results showed that 'DNS1' had the highest total phenolic content (TPC), 'Willamette' had the highest total flavonoid content (TFC), and 'Boyne' had the highest total anthocyanin content (TAC). Phenolic compounds in red raspberries were predominantly found in esterified form, while glycosylated phenolics should not be overlooked. Chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, and arbutin were the main phenolic compounds, and the distribution of their contents varied between varieties. The antioxidant activity in the red raspberry had a close association with the content of phenolic compounds. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities were higher in samples from 'DNS1', 'Boyne', 'Beijing10', 'DNS5', and 'Willamette' varieties. These varieties should be given priority in breeding programs that aim to boost the utility and bioactive profile of red raspberries. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Red raspberry is becoming a desirable commercially grown fruit species and is viewed as a new functional food. In this context, this research offers strong support for confirming the quality of 24 varieties of red raspberry and plays a critical role in the food industry. It also indicates the potential sources of superior varieties of red raspberry, which are advantageous for growers and consumers in search of high-quality red raspberry varieties.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic conditions characterized by periods of intestinal inflammation and have become global diseases. Dietary pectins have shown protective effects on IBD models. However, the development of pectin-based diet intervention for IBD individuals requires knowledge of both the bioactive structural patterns and the mechanisms underlying diet-microbiota-host interactions. Here, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis mice were fed with different pectins with various domain compositions, including AG, P37, P55 and P85, in order to understand why different structural patterns function differently on colitis mouse models. The structural diversity of pectin manifests in the different percentages of the homogalacturonan (HG) backbone, Ara sidechains, and Gal sidechains. AG comprises only neutral sugar chains consisting of 14% Ara and 86% Gal, and P85 is a commercial HG pectin mainly composed of 85% HG. P37 and P55 were isolated from raspberry pulps with different domain ratios (P37 = 37% HG + 22% Ara + 32% Gal; P55 = 55% HG + 16% Ara + 18% Gal). Compared to the monotonous structure of AG and P85, the domain-diverse pectins P37 and P55 show superior protective effects against colitis through inhibiting the proliferation of the mucin-consuming bacteria and the pro-inflammatory microorganisms, potentiating the ",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of adding raspberry pomace to the phenolic content and biological properties of freeze-dried apple/raspberry bars. The bars were prepared by replacing apple puree with raspberry pomace (5-50%), and their phenolic compounds were assessed using ethanol and buffer extracts. This work also explored the potential bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds in enriched bars through a simulated digestion process (digest). Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory (LOX, COX-2 inhibition), antihypertensive (ACE inhibition), and antiproliferative effects on AGS and HT-29 cancer cells were evaluated. The total polyphenol content was highest in the all bar variants post-digestion. The highest-904.26 \u00b1 23.5 mg/100 g-was determined for the B50 sample In the enriched bars, the concentration of chlorogenic acid decreased from 6.99 \u00b1 1.08 mg/L for BP5 to 2.75 \u00b1 0.32 mg/L for BP50, but the ellagic acid concentration increased from 1.46 \u00b1 0.02 mg/L for BP5 to 12.73 \u00b1 0.09 mg/L for BP50. Among the tested extracts, the highest antioxidant and LOX, COX-2 inhibiting activity was determined for digest. The ability to neutralize free radicals increased with raspberry pomace addition from 3.63 \u00b1 0.26 mM TE/100 g for BC to 5.58 \u00b1 0.22 mM TE/100 g for the BP50 sample. ACE inhibition was quite similar for ethanolic and digest extracts, but much weaker for buffer extracts. The lowest EC50 value was 1.04 \u00b1 0.03 mg/mL for the BP30 ethanolic sample. Analyzed extracts showed antiproliferative activity against both tested cell lines. The EC50 values for HT-29 cancer cells decreased from 0.354 \u00b1 0.031 mg/mL for BC to 0.026 \u00b1 0.006 mg/mL for the BP50 digest sample. It can be assumed that the BP30 bar best met the assumed criteria, and is optimal for both sensory quality (receiving an average score of 4.45) and health benefits.",

    "abstract": "Remontant raspberry cultivars originally produce fruit in the upper part of primocanes in the fall, but if retained over winter, they can produce a second crop in the lower part of the floricanes the following spring. Maintaining remontant cultivars to yield twice during the cane's growth cycle corresponds to a double-cropping system, which enables an increase in the total yield and the extension of the fruiting season. To date, there is little information on changes in fruit quality between primocane and floricane crops. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate variations in the content of sugars and organic acids, fruit weight, color and textural and sensorial attributes among five newly introduced remontant raspberry cultivars ('Dafne', 'Kokanee', 'Paris', 'Versailles' and 'Primalba') and the control cultivar 'Enrosadira'. The specific aim was to evaluate how a double-cropping system in each cultivar may affect the variability in quality traits between primocane and floricane crops. The results showed a significant increase in fruit weight and individual and total sugar content in primocane crops, while significantly brighter red-colored and firmer fruits were observed in floricane crops. Cultivars did not differ from the control regarding total sugar content and sweetness index, while the content of individual sugars caused greater variations. The highest content of citric, malic and total acid (9.74, 1.42 and 11.25 mg 100 g",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease with a high mortality rate due to non-traumatic fractures. The risk of osteoporosis is increasing globally due to an increasing aging population. Current therapies are limited to delaying disease progression. Recently, the need to discover foods with osteogenic activity for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis has been emphasized. We focused on bone formation via osteoblast differentiation, considering bone formation and resorption during bone homeostasis. \nWe identified the third subfraction of n-hexane fraction (RL-Hex-NF3) of RL, an endemic Korean plant with osteogenic activity, which increased bone density in ovariectomized mice, a representative animal model of osteoporosis, via the depletion of female hormones, which resulted from the increase in the osteoblast population. RL-Hex-NF3 induced osteoblast differentiation and the expression of osteogenic markers in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. Seven compounds were identified from RL-Hex-NF3 using NMR spectroscopy. Of these, three compounds, namely, 3\u03b2-hydroxy-18\u03b1,19\u03b1-urs-20-en-28-oic acid, betulinic acid, and (1S,6R,7S)-muurola-4,10(14)-diene-15-ol, showed strong osteogenic activity.\nRL-Hex-NF3 and its compounds suppress bone loss via their osteogenic properties, suggesting that they could be a potent candidate to treat osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "The biostimulant SuperFifty, produced from the brown algae \nMetabolome analysis was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS), and essential elements analysis was performed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).\nHere, we demonstrate that SuperFifty increases the fruit size of both raspberries and strawberries and enhances the yield in these two berry crops by 42.1% (raspberry) and 33.9% (strawberry) while preserving the nutritional properties of the fruits. Metabolome analysis of 100 metabolites revealed that antioxidants, essential amino acids, organic acids, sugars, and vitamins, such as glutathione, alanine, asparagine, histidine, threonine, serine, tryptophan, sucrose, citric acid, pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), as well as other primary metabolites, remain the same in the SuperFifty-primed fruits. Secondary metabolites, such as caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, kaempferol, and quercetin, also maintained their levels in the SuperFifty-primed fruits. Analysis of essential elements demonstrated that elements important for human health, such as Zn, Mn, Fe, B, Cu, K, and Ca, maintain the same levels in the raspberry and strawberry fruits obtained from the biostimulant-primed plants. Magnesium, an important element known as a co-factor in many enzymatic reactions related to both plant physiology and human health, increased in both raspberry and strawberry fruits primed with SuperFifty. Finally, we discuss the potential financial and health benefits of the SuperFifty-induced priming for both growers and consumers.\nWe demonstrate that SuperFifty significantly enhances the yield of both raspberries and strawberries, improves the marketable grade of the fruits (larger and heavier fruits), and enhances the nutritional properties by elevating Mg content in the fruits. Altogether, this biostimulant-induced molecular priming offers an environmentally friendly, efficient, and sustainable way to enhance the yield and quality of berry crops, with clear benefits to both berry producers and customers.",

    "abstract": "Secondary metabolites are a group of invaluable phytochemicals in raspberries. Fermentation process leads to changes in the phytochemical composition of fruits. This study aimed to investigate the influence of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei FBKL1.0328 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum FBKL1.0310 on the secondary metabolites of red raspberry juice (CR) and uncover their conversion pathways via metabolomics based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). A total of 695 secondary metabolites in the unfermented and fermented samples were identified. There were 90, 83 and 52 differential secondary metabolites identified in LCR (L. paracasei FBKL1.0328 fermented raspberry juice) vs. CR, LPR (L. plantarum FBKL1.0310 fermented raspberry juice) vs. CR, and LCR vs. LPR, respectively. Certain phenolic acids (e.g. 3-phenyllacitc acid), flavonoids (e.g. galangin-7-glucoside), alkaloids (e.g. indole-3-lactic acid), and terpenoids (e.g. glucosyl 7-methyl-3-methyleneoctane-1,2,6,7-tetraol) were selected as the crucial differential metabolites. These two lactobacilli utilized distinct metabolic pathways for processing secondary metabolites. L. paracasei FBKL1.0328 primarily transformed flavonoids through the \"Flavone and flavonol biosynthesis\" pathway. L. plantarum FBKL1.0310 mainly converted phenolic acids via the \"Tyrosine metabolism\" pathway and the \"Aminobenzoate degradation\" pathway. Interestingly, L. plantarum FBKL1.0310 outperformed L. paracasei FBKL1.0328 in upregulating certain valuable bioactive compounds such as indole-3-lactic acid and 3-phenyllacitc acid, underscoring its potential as a promising strain for developing health-beneficial fermented fruit juices. These findings provide insights to how different lactobacilli modify secondary metabolite composition in red raspberry juice and offer valuable information for the industrial application of lactobacilli in fruit processing.",

    "abstract": "There is continuing interest in the synthesis of raspberry-like polymer particles, among which most of the reports have tended to focus on polymer composite particles, while there are relatively few examples of polymer particles with a single component. In this study, raspberry-like poly(methyl methacrylate)(PMMA) particles were synthesized by a one-step method in a ternary solvent mixture with binary initiators. The effects of different polymerization parameters, including the solvent composition, the initiator composition, the stabilizer component, the polymerization temperature, the stirring rate, and the nature of the monomer, on the morphology and size of the resulting particles were studied. A plausible mechanism for raspberry-like particle formation was suggested based on the monitoring data of the polymerization kinetics. The raspberry-like PMMA particles have a high dispersion stability in a salty aqueous environment.",

    "abstract": "While tobacco smoking is a risk factor in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), only a fraction of smokers develop the disease. Compelling evidence shows that microbial community composition is associated with carcinogenesis, suggesting that the microbiome may play a role in cancer development of smokers. We previously showed that black raspberry (BRB) protects against OSCC induced by the tobacco constituent dibenzo[def,p]chrysene (DBP) via alteration of genetic and epigenetic markers in a manner consistent with its cancer preventive activity. In the present study, we conducted a mouse experiment to investigate the effects of BRB and DBP individually and in combination on the oral and gut microbiota. DBP-induced DNA damage in the mouse oral cavity is an essential step for the development of OSCC in mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that BRB significantly increased microbial diversity and shifted microbiome composition in the gut and oral cavity, whereas DBP had no significant effect. In both gut and oral microbiota, Akkermansia muciniphila was significantly reduced after BRB treatment; however, this was not consistent with pure culture in vitro assays suggesting that the impact of BRB on A. muciniphila may be mediated through indirect mechanisms including the host or other microbes. Indeed BRB, but not DBP, was found to modulate the growth kinetics of human gut microbes in vitro including lactic acid bacteria and Bacteroides spp. The results of the current study further emphasize the interplay of microbiome and environmental factors in the development and prevention of OSCC. Prevention Relevance: Our work clearly demonstrates the modulatory impact of BRB on both gut and oral microbiomes within a DBP-induced OSCC mouse model and paves the way for future research examining a causal role of BRB-microbiota interactions at different stages of disease progression.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to analyze the chemical composition of raspberry using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology, predict the potential effects of raspberry in treating type 2 diabetes through network pharmacology, and conduct preliminary validation through in\u00a0vitro experiments.\nA Waters CORTECS C18 column (3.0\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009mm, 2.7\u2009\u03bcm) was used; mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water and mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Gradient elution was performed with full-scan mode in both positive and negative ion modes, covering a mass range of m/z 100-1500. The chemical components of raspberry were analyzed and identified based on secondary spectra from databases and relevant literature. The disease targets related to type 2 diabetes were searched, and protein-protein interaction network analysis as well as gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were conducted on the intersecting targets of the active components of raspberry and the disease. HepG2 cells were used for experimental validation, with high glucose-induced insulin resistance models established. The CCK-8 method was employed to assess the effects of raspberry on cell proliferation, while Western blotting was used to measure the expression of proteins related to the AGE/RAGE signaling pathway.\nA total of 47 components were identified, including 10 organic acids, 15 flavonoids, 12 phenols, 2 alkaloids, 4 terpenoids, 1 miscellaneous compound, 1 stilbene, 1 steroid and its derivatives, and 1 diterpenoid. Through database screening, seven active components were identified: kaempferol, epicatechin, ellagic acid, crocetin, stigmasterol, fisetin, and isorhamnetin. KEGG and GO results indicated that the therapeutic effects of raspberry on type 2 diabetes may be related to the advanced glycation end product (AGE)- receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) signaling pathway. Establishment of an insulin resistance model in HepG2 cells demonstrated that, compared to the control group, the raspberry treatment group upregulated p53 protein expression while downregulating the expression of RAGE, Akt1, and Caspase-3 proteins.\nThis study preliminarily elucidates that the therapeutic effects of raspberry in treating type 2 diabetes may be mediated through the inhibition of the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, providing important references for the study of the pharmacological basis and clinical application of raspberry.",

    "abstract": "Conventional solid-based SERS substrates often face challenges with inconsistent sample distribution, while liquid-based SERS substrates are prone to aggregation and precipitation, resulting in irreproducible signals in both cases. In this study, we tackled this dilemma by designing and synthesizing raspberry-like plasmonic nanoaggregates that exhibit a high density of hotspots and are colloidally stable at the same time. In particular, the nanoaggregates consist of a core made of functionalized polystyrene (PS) microspheres, which act as a template for rapid self-assembly of Au@Ag core-shell nanoparticles to form raspberry-like hierarchical nanoaggregates within 5 min of mixing. The optimized nanoaggregates can be used as reproducible and stable SERS substrates for a range of wastewater pollutants (e.g., rhodamine 6G (R6G) and malachite green (MG)) and nucleobases (e.g., adenine and uracil), with the detection limits as low as 1 \u00d7 10",

We demonstrate the use of a white light LED (light emitting diode) to illuminate pollen grains and capture their scattering pattern using a Raspberry Pi camera. The scattering patterns are transformed into 20\u00d7 microscope magnification equivalent images using deep learning. We show the ability to produce images of pollen from plant species previously unseen by the neural network in training. Such a technique could be applied to imaging airborne particulates that contribute to air pollution, and could be used in the field of environmental science, health science and agriculture.",

    "abstract": "The cotton whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) is a major global pest, causing significant crop damage through viral infestation and feeding. Traditional B. tabaci recognition relies on human eyes, which requires a large amount of work and high labor costs. The pests overlapping generations, high reproductive capacity, small size, and migratory behavior present challenges for the real-time monitoring and early warning systems. This study aims to develop an efficient, high-throughput automated system for detection of the cotton whiteflies. In this work, a novel tool for cotton whitefly fast identification and quantification was developed based on deep learning-based model. This approach enhances the effectiveness of B. tabaci control by facilitating earlier detection of its establishment in cotton, thereby allowing for a quicker implementation of management strategies.\nWe compiled a dataset of 1200 annotated images of whiteflies on cotton leaves, augmented using techniques like flipping and rotation. We modified the YOLO v8s model by replacing the C2f module with the Swin-Transformer and introducing a P2 structure in the Head, achieving a precision of 0.87, mAP\nUtilizing the enhanced YOLO v8s deep learning model, we have achieved precise detection and counting of whiteflies, enabling its application on hardware devices like the Raspberry Pi. This approach is highly suitable for research requiring accurate quantification of cotton whiteflies, including phenotypic analyses. Future work will focus on deploying such equipment in large fields to manage whitefly infestations.",

    "abstract": "Rubus idaeus is a pivotal cultivated species of raspberry known for its attractive color, distinct flavor, and numerous health benefits. It can be used in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, agriculture and food industries not only as fresh but also as a processed product. Nowadays due to climatic changes, genetic diversity of cultivars has decreased dramatically. However, until now, the status of wild R. idaeus resources in China have not been exploited. In this study, we investigated the resources of wild R. idaeus in China to secure its future potential and sustainability. The MaxEnt model was used to predict R. idaeus suitable habitats and spatial distribution patterns for current and future climate scenarios, based on wild domestic geographic distribution data, current and future climate variables, and topographic variables. The results showed that, mean temperature of the coldest quarter (bio11), precipitation of the coldest quarter (bio19), precipitation of the warmest quarter (bio18), and temperature seasonality (bio4) were crucial factors affecting the distribution of R. idaeus. Presently, the suitable habitats were mainly distributed in the north of China including Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang. According to our results, in 2050s, the total suitable habitat area of R. idaeus will increase under SSP1-2.6 and then will be decreased with climate change, while in the 2090s, the total suitable habitat area will continue to decrease. From the present to the 2090s, the centroid distribution of R. idaeus in China will shift towards the east and the species will always be present in Inner Mongolia. Our results provide wild resource information and theoretical reference for the protection and rational utilization of R. idaeus.",

    "abstract": "Actinobacteria may help the mycorrhizal symbiosis by producing various bioactive metabolites. Mycorrhizae, in turn, are very important since they increase the absorption of nutrients, promoting the growth of their host plant and making inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi (AM) a common practice applied in agriculture and forestry. The cultivation of Rubus idaeus (raspberry) is widespread in Patagonia, Argentina; however, the potential benefits of using actinobacteria-mycorrhizal inoculums to enhance crop growth and yield remain unexplored. The objective of this work was to study the interaction between actinobacteria (Streptomyces, Actinomycetota) and AM in raspberry plants. We performed an experiment applying 4 treatments to raspberry plants growing in two substrates, sterile soil and natural (non-sterile) soil. The treatments consisted in a control (without inoculation) and three inoculations treatments (AM, Streptomyces SH9 strain, and AM\u2009+\u2009Streptomyces). After 3\u00a0months of inoculation, mycorrhization parameters (%) and plant growth were recorded. When comparing both substrates, the mycorrhization parameters were higher in natural soil than in sterile soil. The co-inoculation with AM\u2009+\u2009Streptomyces SH9 showed the highest mycorrhization. Both factors (treatment x substrate) interacted showing that in sterile soil the treatments with the highest effect on mycorrhization parameters were AM and the co-inoculation, while in natural soil all inoculations improved mycorrhization parameters, being highest with the co-inoculation. These results show that Streptomyces SH9 strain helps the mycorrhizal symbiosis in raspberry, being the first report about the effect of a native rhizospheric actinobacterium on an economically important species, promising potential for environmentally friendly improvements in raspberry crops within the temperate Southern Patagonian region.",

    "abstract": "Using LC-MS/MS analysis we previously showed for the first time (Carcinogenesis 43:746-753, 2022) that levels of DNA damage-induced by benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), an oral carcinogen and tobacco smoke (TS) constituent, were significantly higher in buccal cells of smokers than those in non-smokers; these results suggest the potential contribution of B[a]P in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in humans. Treating cancers, including OSCC at late stages even with improved targeted therapies, continues to be a major challenge. Thus interception/prevention remains a preferable approach for OSCC management and control. In previous preclinical studies we and others demonstrated the protective effects of black raspberry (BRB) against carcinogen-induced DNA damage and OSCC. Thus, to translate preclinical findings we tested the hypothesis, in a Phase 0 clinical study, that BRB administration reduces DNA damage induced by B[a]P in buccal cells of smokers. After enrolling 27 smokers, baseline buccal cells were collected before the administration of BRB lozenges (5/day for 8 weeks, 1 gm BRB powder/lozenge) at baseline, at the middle and the end of BRB administration. The last samples were collected at four weeks after BRB cessation (washout period). B[a]P-induced DNA damage (BPDE-N2-dG) was evaluated by LC-MS/MS. BRB administration resulted in a significant reduction in DNA damage: 26.3% at the midpoint (p = 0.01506) compared to baseline, 36.1% at the end of BRB administration (p = 0.00355), and 16.6% after BRB cessation (p = 0.007586). Our results suggest the potential benefits of BRB as a chemopreventive agent against the development of TS-initiated OSCC.",

    "abstract": "Raspberries (Rosales: Rosaceae) are considered to be one of most important crops in northwestern Morocco. However, this sector is seriously affected by the attack of Drosophila suzukii, which impairs the production and the export. Furthermore, the eco-ethology and population dynamics of D. suzukii under Moroccan conditions are still poorly understood. In Larache region, we monitored the population dynamics of D. suzukii adults using 4 traps baited with mashed ripe banana mixed with yeast, and reported the infestation levels during spring of 2022, 2023, and 2024 on raspberry cultivar Rubus idaeus var. Yazmin. Our results indicate that a maximum of 14, 20, and 28 D. suzukii adults per trap were caught weekly at the end of April 2022, in the middle of March 2023, and in the middle of April 2024, respectively. Furthermore, three peaks of D. suzukii adult flies were observed each year, whereas a total of six generations were predicted according to the accumulated degree-days. The male sex ratio of trapped D. suzukii was 1:0.32, 1:0.38, and 1:0.42 in 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. Raspberry fruit infestation reached a maximum of 76%, 75%, and 64% at the beginning of May 2022, middle of April 2023, and end of April 2024, respectively. Under the climate change scenario, knowledge of the eco-ethology of this insect and its population dynamics is essential for developing an IPM control strategy in Morocco, and further studies are ongoing to establish a biological and reasoned chemical approach based on degree-days.",

    "abstract": "Winter dormancy is a key process in the phenology of temperate perennials. Climate change is severely impacting its course leading to economic losses in agriculture. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms, as well as the genetic basis of the different responses, is necessary for the development of climate-resilient cultivars. This study aims to provide an insight into winter dormancy in red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L). We report the transcriptomic profiles during dormancy in two raspberry cultivars with contrasting responses. The cultivar 'Glen Ample' showed a typical perennial phenology, whereas 'Glen Dee' registered consistent dormancy dysregulation, exhibiting active growth and flowering out of season. RNA-seq combined with weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified gene clusters in both genotypes that exhibited time-dependent expression profiles. Functional analysis of 'Glen Ample' gene clusters highlighted the significance of the cell and structural development prior to dormancy entry as well the role of genetic and epigenetic processes such as RNAi and DNA methylation in regulating gene expression. Dormancy release in 'Glen Ample' was associated with up-regulation of transcripts associated with the resumption of metabolism, nucleic acid biogenesis, and processing signal response pathways. Many of the processes occurring in 'Glen Ample' were dysregulated in 'Glen Dee' and 28 transcripts exhibiting time-dependent expression in 'Glen Ample' that also had an Arabidopsis homologue were not found in 'Glen Dee'. These included a gene with homology to Arabidopsis VRN1 (RiVRN1.1) that exhibited a sharp decline in expression following dormancy induction in 'Glen Ample'. Characterization of the gene region in the 'Glen Dee' genome revealed two large insertions upstream of the ATG start codon. We propose that expression below detection level of a specific VRN1 homologue in 'Glen Dee' causes dormancy misregulation as a result of inappropriate expression of a subset of genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by RiVRN1.1.",

    "abstract": "Thermal burns are the most common type of burn injuries. Medical treatment for burns is crucial, especially for third-degree burns and when a significant surface area of the body is affected. One of the most pressing issues in modern medicine is the search for new effective means to accelerate the healing of burn wounds. Oxygen radicals play a significant role in maintaining homeostasis, forming the body's resistance to infection, and ensuring the regeneration of organs and tissues. In this study, a superoxide (O2-)-producing enzyme (SPE) from raspberries was applied (topically to the skin, injected under the wound surface, with solution concentrations of 12.75% and 5%) after a third-degree thermal burn to determine its reparative effects on the skin. To assess the condition of the animals that had suffered burn injuries and the healing process, blood parameters were analyzed, and cytogenetic indices of bone marrow from the femur of the animals were studied: mitotic index, number of polyploid cells, and chromosomal aberrations. When analyzing hematological, cytogenetic, and histological parameters, significant differences were found between the \u00abclean burn\u00bb groups and the groups in which SPE was used in different concentrations and methods of application. The use of SPE in both concentrations contributed to a reduction in the area of burn wounds compared to a \u00abclean burn\u00bb. The survival rate of animals for 30 days (before the end of the experiment) was 100% when using a 12.75% SPE solution and 50% when using a 5% SPE solution. The use of SPE led to significant differences in hematological parameters from the \u00abclean burn\u00bb group throughout the entire duration of the experiment, showing a tendency to normalize the parameters. Under the influence of the 12.75% SPE solution, there was a tendency toward normalization of the mitotic index, along with a significant reduction in the percentage of polyploid cells and chromosomal aberrations, which may indicate its beneficial effects. This study found that a 12.75% SPE solution derived from raspberries was more effective and had healing properties on third-degree thermal burns, promoting rapid healing of the burn wound.",

    "abstract": "Application of microbial-based biopreparations as a pre-harvest strategy offers a method to obtain sustainable agricultural practices and could be an important approach for advancing food science, promoting sustainability, and meeting global food market demands. The impact of a bacterial-fungal biopreparation mixture on soil-plant-microbe interactions, fruit chemical composition and yield of 7 raspberry clones was investigated by examining the structural and functional profiles of microbial communities within leaves, fruits, and soil. Biopreparation addition caused the enhancement of the microbiological utilization of specific compounds, such as d-mannitol, relevant in plant-pathogen interactions and overall plant health. The biopreparation treatment positively affected the nitrogen availability in soil (9-160%). The analysis of plant stress marker enzymes combined with the evaluation of fruit quality and chemical properties highlight changes inducted by the pre-harvest biopreparation application. Chemical analyses highlight biopreparations' role in soil and fruit quality improvement, promoting sustainable agriculture. This effect was dependent on tested clones, showing increase of soluble solid content in fruits, concentration of polyphenols or the sensory quality of the fruits. The results of the next-generation sequencing indicated increase in the effective number of bacterial species after biopreparation treatment. The network analysis showed stimulating effect of biopreparation on microbial communities by enhancing microbial interactions (increasing the number of network edges up to 260%) of and affecting the proportions of mutual relationships between both bacteria and fungi. These findings show the potential of microbial-based biopreparation in enhancing raspberry production whilst promoting sustainable practices and maintaining environmental homeostasis and giving inshght in holistic understanding of microbial-based approaches for advancing food science monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry plants need intensive anti-fungal protection. A solution to this problem could be the application of an ozonation process. For this purpose, a technical solution was proposed and implemented in raspberry plant production. The proposal suggests replacing 25% of standard fungicide treatments with ozonation. It was demonstrated that the use of ozone under the proposed conditions made it possible to maintain stable parameters of chlorophyll content and fluorescence (no significant differences), but the intensity of gas exchange was increased. The greatest differences were observed in the second measurement period (T2), when the plants were in the stage of most active development. Additionally, the content and profile of low-molecular-weight antioxidants and the microbial load were determined in the collected fruits. In periods T2 and T3, the proposed method caused a reduction reaching ~2 log cfu g",

Raspberry ketone (RK) is an aromatic phenolic compound found in many plants and could contribute to weight loss, restore impaired glucose tolerance, and has antioxidant properties. In our investigation, RK could greatly prevent islet, brain and other tissue damage caused by hyperglycemia in a zebrafish model with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemia. Body weight, insulin level, and food intake indexes were also restored by RK. Using transcriptome profiling, we found that RK administration could significantly attenuate STZ-induced insulin synthesis and pancreatic secretion as well as alter protein and carbohydrate metabolism. Metabolomics analysis results showed that RK could also prevent STZ-induced metabolic disorders, such as adenosine and sphingolipid metabolism.

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone accounts for the characteristic aroma of the raspberry fruit. In order to explore the genes involved in raspberry ketone synthesis, the transcriptome in fruit tissues of two red raspberry varieties \"Polka\" and \"Orange legend\", were sequenced and 24213 single genes were obtained. As the red raspberry fruit ripening, genes involved in flavonoid and anthocyanin synthesis were up-regulated, while those associated with lignin synthesis were down-regulated. A gene (RinPKS4) highly related to raspberry ketone synthesis was identified by transcriptome analysis, and RinPKS4 gene was over-expressed in raspberry in order to further understand the function of RinPKS4 gene in raspberry ketone synthesis. The results showed that the gene expression level of RinPKS4 in the leaf tissues of a transgenic lines increased by about 4-fold and the content of raspberry ketone increased by 42.64% compared with the wide type. This study lays a theoretical foundation for further study on the synthesis and regulation of raspberry ketone in red raspberry.",

    "abstract": "Over the last 10 years, global raspberry production has increased by 47.89%, based mainly on the red raspberry species (Rubus idaeus). However, the black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis), although less consumed, is resistant to one of the most important diseases for the crop, the late leaf rust caused by Acculeastrum americanum fungus. In this context, genetic resistance is the most sustainable way to control the disease, mainly because there are no registered fungicides for late leaf rust in Brazil. Therefore, the aim was to understand the genetic architecture that controls resistance to late leaf rust in raspberries. For that, we used an interspecific multiparental population using the species mentioned above as parents, 2 different statistical approaches to associate the phenotypes with markers [GWAS (genome-wide association studies) and copula graphical models], and 2 phenotyping methodologies from the first to the 17th day after inoculation (high-throughput phenotyping with a multispectral camera and traditional phenotyping by disease severity scores). Our findings indicate that a locus of higher effect, at position 13.3 Mb on chromosome 5, possibly controls late leaf rust resistance, as both GWAS and the network suggested the same marker. Of the 12 genes flanking its region, 4 were possible receptors, 3 were likely defense executors, 1 gene was likely part of signaling cascades, and 4 were classified as nondefense related. Although the network and GWAS indicated the same higher effect genomic region, the network identified other different candidate regions, potentially complementing the genetic control comprehension.",

We illustrated that adjusting the temperature of organosilanes functionalization on the surface allows for various reactions, such as the direct grafting of metallic precursors or their polymerization on the surface, resulting in the formation of large raspberry-like particles. We investigated the impact of nanoparticle concentration, functionalization duration, and reaction temperature on surface properties. Our results reveal that a concentration of 1.5\u00a0% SiO",

In this study, we synthesized hydrophilic DES (CL-CA-DES) using citric acid and choline chloride. We combined this with environmentally friendly anion- and cation-exchange resin column chromatographic isolation methods. This approach extracted and isolated four polyphenolic compounds (catechins, epicatechins, procyanidin B1, and procyanidin B2) from raspberry root and efficiently recovered the hydrophilic DES. CL-CA-DES extracted significantly higher contents of catechin and procyanidin B2 from raspberry root compared to other solvents. It also extracted substantially higher contents of epicatechin compared to butyl alcohol, 70% ethanol, and water, but there was no significant difference when compared with acetone and ethyl acetate. Additionally, CL-CA-DES extracted significantly higher contents of procyanidin B1 compared to butyl alcohol, water, and ethyl acetate, with no significant difference when compared with 70% ethanol and acetone. The isolation efficiency of the bioactive components in the raspberry root extract by anion- and cation-exchange resin column chromatography was higher than that of the organic solvent extraction and precipitation generation methods, and the method was effective in recovering CL-CA-DES with a recovery rate higher than 60%. In conclusion, this study developed a new method for the efficient recovery of hydrophilic CL-CA-DES, which can be used for isolating polyphenolic compounds from raspberry root.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the therapeutic effects of raspberry have been the subject of several randomized control trials (RCTs). However, there is no consensus about the effect of raspberry consumption on anthropometric indices and liver function tests. So, the present review aims to investigate this effectiveness by conducting a meta-analysis.\nPubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched to identify eligible randomized control trials (RCTs) up to March 2024. The overall effect sizes were estimated using the random-effects model as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nNine studies (10 arms) with 355 participants were eligible for inclusion in this review. This meta-analysis showed that raspberry consumption did not lead to significant changes in anthropometric indices (weight, body mass index, and waist circumference) and liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase).\nThis review revealed that raspberry consumption had no significant impact on anthropometric indices or liver function tests. However, more RCTs with a larger sample size and higher sensitivity are needed to draw definite conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry (Rubus corchorifolius) plants hold historical, economic, and medicinal importance in China (Yang et al. 2022). Raspberries are cultivated to generate income for local farmers in Lintao County, Dingxi City, Gansu Province. However, farmers encountered challenges due to raspberry plants exhibiting root rot disease, resulting in plant death. During a thorough field survey conducted in June 2022, symptoms ranging from leaf yellowing and wilting to necrotic lesions and root rots were observed, where approximately 30% of raspberry plants were affected. Five diseased and healthy plants were collected from the farmers' fields in Lintao (35.53oN, 103.84oE) for pathogen identification. Symptomatic and asymptomatic root tissues were surface sterilized with 75% ethanol for 30 s and 3% NaOCl for 5 min, followed by three rinses in sterile water. Small pieces (0.5 \u00d7 0.5 cm) were cut and incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates at 25\u00b0C for 7-10 days. Twenty-two pure Fusarium isolates, which displayed four distinct colony groups morphologically, were obtained. Pathogenicity tests on isolates RB10, RB1, RB30, and RB23, representing each colony group, revealed that RB10 exhibited symptoms similar to those observed in the field. The RB10 strain produced yellowish-white to greyish-white colonies on PDA and was then cultured in a carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) broth for enhanced conidia production (Zhang et al. 2020). Macroconidia were sickle-shaped or slightly curved, with three to five septa (19.2 to 38.5 x 3.1 to 5.8 \u00b5m, n =40). Microconidia were oval to ellipsoidal, non-septate or featuring 1 to 2 septa (4.8 to 10.5 x 2.1 to 5.2 \u00b5m, n=20). These morphological features indicated the isolate was similar to Fusarium avenaceum (Leslie and Summerell, 2006). For further identification of the strains, genomic regions (ITS-rDNA, TEF-1\u03b1, and RPB2) were amplified and sequenced using specific primers ITS1/ITS4, EF-1/EF-2, and 5f2/7cr, respectively (O'Donnell et al. 2010; Uwaremwe et al. 2021; Zarrin et al. 2016). PCR BLASTn queries of NCBI GenBank revealed a 99.8% (522 bp), 99.4% (355 bp) and 99.6% (985 bp) homology with F. avenaceum (MZ724839.1, MN271631.1, and MK185026.1), respectively. Sequences were deposited in GenBank (ITS, OR735571; TEF-1\u03b1, PP216660; RPB2, PP857820). One-year-old raspberry seedlings were planted in pots with a sterile soil mix (2:2:1 v/v ratio of soil, peat, and vermiculite) under controlled greenhouse conditions (23-26\u00b0C, 16h light/8h dark). A month post-planting, taproots were wounded in six pots and inoculated with 20 ml of conidia suspension (106 conidia/ml), while the other six pots were maintained as controls. After 14 days, RB10-infected plants showed symptoms similar to field observations, while controls remained healthy. The experiment was conducted twice, and re-isolation confirmed both the pathogenicity and identity of the pathogen. In the concatenated phylogenetic tree of ITS, TEF-1\u03b1 and RPB2, strain RB10 was clustered with the F. avenaceum representative strains KG502, KG431 and F094. Studies revealed F. avenaceum varied pathogenicity across plants (Bugingo, 2022; Moparthi et al. 2020& 2024; Yli-Mattila et al. 2018), and it has been reported to induce raspberry fruit rot (Wang et al. 2017). However, no previous reports linked this fungus to raspberry root rot. This report is crucial for understanding the impact of root rot disease on raspberry cultivation and developing effective management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Fruits are perishable, thus it's crucial to have an efficient preservation technique that can increase storage time while keeping physical quality and nutritional attributes in order to avoid wastage. The majority of methods for long-term storage require refrigeration.\nIn this investigation, we assess the viability of isochoric freezing as a different technique of raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) preservation. Raspberries were subjected to different storage conditions: isochoric freezing at -4\u00b0C, conventional isobaric settings at +3\u00b0C (refrigerator), -21\u00b0C (freezer), and -4\u00b0C with a trehalose solution in a plastic bag. The study assessed changes in weight loss, visual appearance, color, hardness, \u00b0Brix values, and pH over a seven-day period.\nKey findings reveal that raspberries subjected to isochoric freezing below the freezing point of water experienced minimal weight loss after seven days. Visual appearance, color, hardness, \u00b0Brix values, and pH were comparable to fresh raspberries, indicating minimal alteration.\nThese results suggest that isochoric freezing shows potential as a preservation method that maintains the physical and chemical properties of raspberries similar to fresh fruit. Implementing diverse preservation techniques tailored to raspberries may contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing food wastage and the associated environmental impact.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a simple and accurate approach is proposed for enhancing the origin identification of raspberry samples using a combination of innovative Raman spectral preprocessing techniques, feature selection, and machine learning algorithms. Window function was creatively introduced and combined with baseline removal technique to preprocess the Raman spectral data, reducing the dimensionality of the raw data and ensuring the quality of the processed data. An optimization process was conducted to determine the optimal parameter for the window function, resulting in a binning window width of 5 that yielded the highest accuracy. After applying three feature selection techniques, it was found that the information gain model had the best performance in extracting discriminative spectral features. Finally, ten different machine learning algorithms were employed to construct predictive models, and the optimal models were selected. Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC), Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier (MLPClassifier), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) achieve accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 values above 0.96, while the Random Vector Functional Link Network Classifier (RVFLClassifier) surpasses 0.93 for these performance metrics. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying the origin of raspberry samples with high accuracy and robustness, providing a valuable tool for agricultural product authentication and quality control.",

    "abstract": "Natural biosorbents from agricultural side stream products are being investigated due to their large surface area and capacity for various compounds. The aim of the present work was to investigate the raspberry seeds and their sorption potential in the recovery of natural pigments. The experiment included raspberry seed and a liquid by-phase rich in anthocyanins initially collected during the depulping of the raspberry seed material. Biosorption was monitored by LC-MS analysis of the anthocyanins and by the total anthocyanin content (TAC) before and after biosorption. Cyanidins predominated in the seed material, followed by pelargonidins and peonidins. The efficiency of biosorption was examined by comparing the percent of removal. The heterogeneous polymer structure of the biosorbent, which consists mainly of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose, was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman Spectroscopy (RS). The FTIR spectra of raw and defatted seed indicated functional groups involved in biosorption and principal component analysis (PCA) performed on Raman spectra pointed to differences among biosorbents. The developed strategy for the valorization of raspberry seeds in the recovery of natural colorants was shown to be effective, with recoveries from 49 to 88 percent of total anthocyanins.",

    "abstract": "With glossy, wax-coated leaves, Rubus leucanthus is one of the few heat-tolerant wild raspberry trees. To ascertain the underlying mechanism of heat tolerance, we generated a high-quality genome assembly with a genome size of 230.9 Mb and 24,918 protein-coding genes. Significantly expanded gene families were enriched in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and the circadian rhythm-plant pathway, enabling survival in subtropical areas by accumulating protective flavonoids and modifying photoperiodic responses. In contrast, plant-pathogen interaction and MAPK signaling involved in response to pathogens were significantly contracted. The well-known heat response elements (HSP70, HSP90, and HSFs) were reduced in R. leucanthus compared to two other heat-intolerant species, R. chingii and R. occidentalis, with transcriptome profiles further demonstrating their dispensable roles in heat stress response. At the same time, three significantly positively selected genes in the pathway of cuticular wax biosynthesis were identified, and may contribute to the glossy, wax-coated leaves of R. leucanthus. The thick, leathery, waxy leaves protect R. leucanthus against pathogens and herbivores, supported by the reduced R gene repertoire in R. leucanthus (355) compared to R. chingii (376) and R. occidentalis (449). Our study provides some insights into adaptive divergence between R. leucanthus and other raspberry species on heat tolerance.",

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are effective in degrading these stubborn compounds, with Oxone activation being a particularly promising method. In this study, a unique nanohybrid material, raspberry-like CuCo alloy embedded carbon (RCCC), is facilely fabricated using CuCo-glycerate (Gly) as a template. With the incorporation of Cu into Co, RCCC is essentially different from its analogue derived from Co-Gly in the absence of Cu, affording a popcorn-like Co embedded on carbon (PCoC). RCCC exhibits a unique morphology, featuring a hollow spherical layer covered by nanoscale beads composed of CuCo alloy distributed over carbon. Therefore, RCCC significantly outperforms PCoC and Co",

    "abstract": "The adoption of the European Green Deal will limit acaricide use in high value crops like raspberry, to be replaced by biological control and other alternative strategies. More basic knowledge on mites in such crops is then necessary, like species, density, and their role as vectors of plant diseases. This study had four aims, focusing on raspberry leaves at northern altitude: (1) identify mite species; (2) study mite population densities; (3) investigate mite intra-plant distribution; (4) investigate co-occurrence of phytophagous mites, raspberry leaf blotch disorder and raspberry leaf blotch virus (RLBV). Four sites in south-eastern Norway were sampled five times. Floricanes from different parts of the sites were collected, taking one leaf from each of the upper, middle, and bottom zones of the cane. Mites were extracted with a washing technique and processed for species identification and RLBV detection. Mites and leaves were tested for RLBV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with virus-specific primers. Phytophagous mites, Phyllocoptes gracilis, Tetranychus urticae, and Neotetranychus rubi, and predatory mites, Anystis baccarum and Typhlodromus (Typhlodromus) pyri were identified. All phytophagous mites in cultivated raspberry preferred the upper zone of floricanes, while in non-cultivated raspberry, they preferred the middle zone. The presence of phytophagous mites did not lead to raspberry leaf blotch disorder during this study. RLBV was detected in 1.3% of the sampled plants, none of them with leaf blotch symptoms, and in 4.3% of P. gracilis samples, and in some spider mite samples, implying that Tetranychids could also be vectors of RLBV.",

    "abstract": "Artificial enzymes with high stability, adjustable catalytic activity, controllable preparation, and good reproducibility have been widely studied. Noble metal nanozymes, particularly gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), exhibit good catalytic activity, but their stability is poor. In this study, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) was used as a carrier for Au NPs, thus improving the utilization efficiency and conservation stability of the nanozymes. A ZIF-8/Au nanocomposite with peroxidase activity and a raspberry-shaped structure was synthesized. In the assay, ZIF-8/Au catalyzed the oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue product oxidized TMB (oxTMB). Glutathione (GSH) selectively inhibited this reaction, with a detection limit of 0.28\u00a0\u00b5M and linear range of 0.5-60\u00a0\u00b5M. Using the photo and chromaticity analysis functions, we developed a portable analysis method using a smartphone equipped with a camera module as a detection terminal for a wide range of rapid screening techniques for GSH. Preparation of raspberry-shaped ZIF-8/Au improved the catalytic activity of Au NPs and good results were demonstrated in serum, which suggests their promising application under physiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Despite observing the health benefits of raspberry consumption in some recent studies, there is still no consensus regarding this effectiveness on inflammatory markers and glycemic control. This study aimed to investigate this effectiveness by performing a meta-analysis. The PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were comprehensively searched until December 2023 to find relevant randomized controlled trials. Eligible studies were screened, and relevant information was extracted. The overall effect size of raspberry consumption on each of the outcomes was estimated by following the random-effects model in the form of a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a weighted mean difference (WMD). Raspberry consumption led to a significant increase in insulin concentrations (WMD: 1.89 \u03bcU/mL; 95%CI: 1.45, 2.34; ",

    "abstract": "Pickering emulsions seem to be an effective strategy for encapsulation and stabilization of essential oils. In this work, a novel raspberry-liked Pickering emulsion (RPE) loading Mosla chinensis 'Jiangxiangru' essential oil (MJO) was successfully engineered by using ethyl lauroyl arginate (ELA) decorated nanosilica (ELA-NS) as particles emulsifier. And the ELA-NS-stabilized MJO Pickering emulsion (MJO-RPE) was further prepared into inulin-based microparticles (MJO-RPE-IMP) by spray-drying, using inulin as matrix formers. The concentration of ELA-NS could affect the formation and stabilization of MJO-RPE, and the colloidal behavior of ELA-NS could be modulated at the interfaces with concentration of ELA, thus providing unique role on stabilization of MJO-RPE. The results indicated that the MJO-RPE stabilized ELA-NS with 2\u00a0% NS modified by 0.1\u00a0% ELA had long-term stability. MJO-RPE exhibited a raspberry-liked morphology on the surface, attributed to ELA-NS covered in the droplet surface. The inulin-based matrix formers could effectively prevent MJO-RPE from agglomeration or destruction during spray-drying, and 100\u00a0% concentration of inulin based microparticles formed large composite particles with high loading capacity (98.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.11\u00a0%) and exhibited superior thermal stability and redispersibility of MJO-RPE. The MJO-RPE exhibited strong antibacterial efficacy against Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), owing to the adhesion to bacterial membrane dependent on the raspberry-liked surface of MJO-RPE, whose minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the above three bacteria were (0.3, 0.45, and 1.2\u00a0\u03bcL/mL), respectively, lower than those (0.45, 0.6 and 1.2\u00a0\u03bcL/mL) of MJO. Therefore, the Pickering emulsion composite microparticles seemed to be a promising strategy for enhancing the stability and antibacterial activity of MJO.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry fruit color is a key driver of consumer preference and a major target of breeding programs worldwide. Screening for fruit color typically involves the determination of anthocyanin content and/or the assessment of color through a colorimeter. However, both procedures are time-consuming when the analyses involve hundreds or thousands of samples. The objectives of this study were to develop a high-throughput method for red raspberry puree color measurement and to test the correlations between color parameters and total anthocyanin content. Color coordinates were collected with a colorimeter on 126 puree samples contained in Petri dishes and with the Tomato Analyzer Color Test (TACT) module to assess the same samples prepared in Petri dishes and in 96-well plates. An additional 425 samples were analyzed using only 96-well plates. Total anthocyanins were extracted from all 551 samples.\nRegression models for L*, a*, b* measured with the colorimeter and TACT using Petri dishes were all significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but very consistent only for L* (R\nWhile the colorimeter and TACT-based methods were not fully interchangeable, TACT better captured color differences among raspberry genotypes than the colorimeter. The correlations between color parameters measured with TACT and total anthocyanins were not strong enough to develop prediction models, yet the use of TACT with 96-well plates instead of Petri dishes would enable the high-throughput measurement of red raspberry puree color.",

    "abstract": "The fruit processing industry generates large quantities of by-products well known to be rich in bioactive compounds with numerous nutritional properties and beneficial effects for human health. We developed a strategy to valorise raspberry seeds and obtain valuable ingredients with potential application in cosmetic skincare formulas. Cold press extraction technology was applied to extract oil, and the remaining defatted raspberry seed cake was treated with three proline based deep eutectic solvents (DES) to extract polyphenols. The most potent was proline/citric acid extract, with free and total ellagic acid content (52.4 mg/L and 86.4 mg/L), total phenolic content (TPC, 550.1 mg GAE/L) and radical scavenging activity (RSA, 4742.7 mmol TE/L). After the direct mixing of the extract and after encapsulation with starch as a carrier, the skincare emulsion and microemulsion were characterised by irritation potential (Zein test), transepidermal water loss (TEWL), red blood cell (RBC), and DPPH antioxidant test. The resulting preparations were of improved quality in comparison to the control hand cream, with a low skin irritation effect, lower TEWL, and higher antioxidant potential. This work complies with circular economy principles and green technology standards, and represents the efficient model on how to reuse natural resources through waste minimization.",

    "abstract": "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients face an almost certain 100% risk of developing colorectal cancer, necessitating prophylactic colectomy to prevent disease progression. A crucial goal is to hinder this progression. In a recent clinical trial involving 14 FAP patients, half received 60 g of black raspberry (BRB) powder orally and BRB suppositories at bedtime, while the other half received only BRB suppositories at bedtime over 9 months. This intervention led to a notable reduction in rectal polyps for 11 patients, although 3 showed no response. In this study, we delved into the metabolic changes induced by BRBs in the same patient cohort. Employing mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics, we analyzed pre- and post-BRB urinary and plasma samples from the 11 responders. The results showed significant alterations in 23 urinary and 6 plasma metabolites, influencing various pathways including polyamine, glutathione metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, inositol metabolism, and benzoate production. BRBs notably elevated levels of several metabolites associated with these pathways, suggesting a potential mechanism through which BRBs facilitate rectal polyp regression in FAP patients by modulating multiple metabolic pathways. Notably, metabolites derived from BRB polyphenols were significantly increased post-BRB intervention, emphasizing the potential therapeutic value of BRBs in FAP management.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing trend towards enhancing the post-harvest shelf life and maintaining the nutritional quality of horticultural products using eco-friendly methods. Raspberries are valued for their diverse array of phenolic compounds, which are key contributors to their health-promoting properties. However, raspberries are prone to a relatively short post-harvest lifespan. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of exogenous melatonin (MEL; 0, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1\u00a0mM) on decay control and shelf-life extension. The results demonstrated that MEL treatment significantly reduced the fruit decay rate (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01). Based on the findings, MEL treatment significantly increased titratable acidity (TA), total phenolics content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total anthocyanin content (TAC). Furthermore, the MEL-treated samples showed increased levels of rutin and quercetin content, as well as antioxidant activity as measured by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reduction activity potential (FRAP). Additionally, the samples exhibited higher levels of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and catalase (CAT) enzymes compared to the control samples. Moreover, the levels of pH, total soluble solids (TSS), and IC",

    "abstract": "Concentration of fruit pulp is an important unit operation in food processing and has a wide range of applications. In this study, the microwave heating concentration (MHC) of raspberry pulp at different microwave powers, heating times and sample masses were investigated considering concentration characteristics and quality attributes. The results showed that increasing microwave power/heating time or decreasing sample mass significantly decreased the moisture content but had no significant effect on the temperature of raspberry pulp, while these conditions resulted in loss of total anthocyanin content and deterioration of total color difference. LF-NMR and SEM results revealed that the changes in temperature and moisture content caused by MHC significantly affected the total anthocyanin content and total color difference of the final product. Microwave power of 800\u00a0W, heating time of 3\u00a0min and sample mass of 90\u00a0g are selected as suitable parameters for MHC of raspberry pulp. This study may provide guidance for the development of appropriate technology for MHC of berry pulp.",

    "abstract": "Depression, a prevalent mental disorder, has significantly impacted the lives of 350 million people, yet it holds promise for amelioration through food-derived phenolics. Raspberries, renowned globally for their delectable flavor, harbor a phenolic compound known as raspberry ketone (RK). However, the impact of RK on depressive symptoms remains ambiguous. This study aims to investigate the impact of RK on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressed mice and elucidates its potential mechanisms, focusing on the gut-brain axis.\nThrough behavioral tests, RK exerts a notable preventive effect on LPS-induced depression-like behaviors in mice. RK proves capable of attenuating gut inflammation, repairing gut barrier impairment, modulating the composition of the gut microbiome (Muribaculaceae, Streptococcus, Lachnospiraceae, and Akkermansia), and promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids. Furthermore, RK alleviates neuroinflammation by suppressing the TLR-4/NF-\u03baB pathway and bolsters synaptic function by elevating levels of neurotrophic factors and synapse-associated proteins.\nThe current study provides compelling evidence that RK effectively inhibits the TLR-4/NF-\u03baB pathway via the gut-brain axis, leading to the improvement of LPS-induced depression-like behaviors in mice. This study addresses the research gap in understanding the antidepressant effects of RK and illuminates the potential of utilizing RK as a functional food for preventing depression.",

    "abstract": "Red berries have gained popularity as functional and nutritious food due to their health benefits, leading to increased consumer demand and higher production, totaling over 11,000\u00a0ktons for strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries combined in 2021. Nutritionally, strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries present high levels of vitamin C (9.7-58.8\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g dry weight [dw]), folates (6-24\u00a0\u00b5g/100\u00a0g dw), and minerals (96-228\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g dw). Due to their perishable nature, producers have utilized alcoholic fermentation to extend their shelf life, not only increasing the lifespan of red berries but also attracting consumers through the production of novel beverages. Strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry wines possess low alcohol (5.5-11.1% v/v), high acidity (3.2-17.6\u00a0g/L), and interesting bioactive molecules such as phenolic compounds, carotenoids, polysaccharides, and melatonin. Distillation holds tremendous potential for reducing food waste by creating red berry spirits of exceptional quality. Although research on red berry spirits is still in the early stages, future studies should focus on their production and characterization. By incorporating these factors, the production chain would become more sustainable, profitable, and efficient by reducing food waste, capitalizing on consumer acceptance, and leveraging the natural health-promoting characteristics of these products. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of strawberry, blueberry, and red raspberry in berries, wines, and spirits, with a focus on their chemical composition and production methods.",

    "abstract": "An investigation of the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of polyphenol-rich aqueous extracts from blackberry, chokeberry and raspberry pomaces was carried out. The aim of the study was to choose optimal conditions for UAE in order to obtain extracts rich in phenolic compounds. The optimization was carried out based on response surface methodology. The variable conditions were amplitude of ultrasound wave and extraction time, whereas responses were total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity. Based on the ANOVA analysis, mathematical models were fitted and verified. The most effective conditions of amplitude and time were 98% and 5.00 min, 78% and 10.32 min and 90% and 11.56 min for blackberry pomace, chokeberry pomace and raspberry pomace, respectively. The actual results obtained in optimized conditions were comparable to the results predicted by the models. Additionally, the anthocyanin content in extracts was determined in the high-performance liquid chromatography assay. It was proven that response surface methodology could be a useful tool in the optimization of UAE processes for obtaining polyphenol-rich extracts from berry fruit pomaces.",

    "abstract": "Raspberries are known to contain valuable metabolites and possess a robust antioxidant capacity. However, the impact of different tablet processing stages on the nutritional content and flavor profile of raspberries remains unclear. The dynamic profile of functional and volatile metabolites was investigated through foodomics combined with UPLC-MS/MS-based widely targeted metabolomics and HS-SPME-GC-MS, and antioxidant capacities were assessed during tablet processing. 1336 functional metabolites and 645 volatile metabolites were identified. Results indicated tablets retained 34%\u00a0\u223c\u00a061% of the total volatile contents. In addition, the conversion intensity of functional metabolites was consistent with the order of \"Tableting > Freeze-drying > Crushing\". Compared to raspberry, tablets showed higher antioxidant activity, which was positively correlated with vitamin contents. This study elucidated that tablet formation demonstrated advantages in antioxidation and aroma retention, which may provide insights for enhancing quality during the tableting process.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry leaf use during pregnancy in Australia is widespread. There has been little research exploring the potential beneficial or harmful effects of raspberry leaf on pregnancy, labour, and birth. More research is needed to appropriately inform childbearing women and maternity healthcare professionals on the effects of raspberry leaf so that women can make informed choices.\nThis study aimed to determine associations between raspberry leaf use in pregnancy and augmentation of labour and other secondary outcomes. Data was derived from questionnaires which captured demographic information and herbal use in pregnancy. Clinical outcomes were accessed from the maternity services' clinical database. Data analysis was conducted in R via package 'brms' an implementation for Bayesian regression models.\nA total of 91 completed records were obtained, 44 exposed to raspberry leaf and 47, not exposed. A smaller proportion of women in the raspberry leaf cohort had augmentation of labour, epidural anaesthesia, instrumental births, caesarean section, and postpartum haemorrhage. A larger proportion had vaginal birth and length of all phases of labour were shorter. Under these conditions the use of raspberry leaf was strongly predictive of women not having their labours medically augmented.\nWhile our study demonstrated that raspberry leaf was strongly predictive of women not having their labours medically augmented, the results cannot be relied on or generalised to the wider population of pregnant women. While there were no safety concerns observed in our study, this should not be taken as evidence that raspberry leaf is safe. A randomised controlled trial is urgently needed to provide women and healthcare providers with robust evidence on which to base practice.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have highlighted the beneficial effects of consuming red raspberries on human health thanks to their high content of phytochemicals. However, the products used in these studies, both in the raw or freeze-dried form, were not fully characterized for nutrient and phytochemical composition. In this study, we aimed to determine the nutrient and non-nutrient compounds present in a freeze-dried red raspberry powder widely used by the food industry and consumers. The main sugars identified were fructose (12%), glucose (11%), and sucrose (11%). Twelve fatty acids were detected, with linoleic acid (46%), \u03b1-linolenic acid (20%), and oleic acid (15%) being the most abundant. Regarding micronutrients, vitamin C was the main hydro-soluble vitamin, while minerals, potassium, phosphorous, copper and magnesium were the most abundant, with concentrations ranging from 9 up to 96 mg/100 g, followed by manganese, iron and zinc, detected in the range 0.1-0.9 mg/100 g. Phytochemical analysis using UHPLC-DAD-HR-MS detection revealed the presence of Sanguiin H6 (0.4%), Lambertianin C (0.05%), and Sanguiin H-10 isomers (0.9%) as the main compounds. Among anthocyanins, the most representative compounds were cyanidin-3-sophoroside, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside. Our findings can serve as a reliable resource for the food industry, nutraceutical applications and for future investigations in the context of human health.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates if inexpensive computer hardware, open-source computer vision and a phosphor screen from disused CR (computed radiography) Cassette can be used to quantitatively assess beam shape and area.\nThe phosphor screen was affixed to a Carestream CS 8100 dental OPG system and the camera was mounted above the X-ray tube. Videos were acquired of the green light emissions during the tomographic irradiation. Images of a chessboard pattern, attached to the detector were used to correct for camera angulation and provide image pixel size calibration. K-Means colour clustering was used to define beam area. The effect of light conditions on beam dimension measurement was also investigated. The beam width measurement from optimised methodology was compared with that determined from dose calibrated GAFChromic\nVideos in dark conditions provided the most reproducible results. FW20M gained from initial sampling matched that obtained using the GAFChromic\nThe potential of this low-cost open-source method of beam area measurement using computer vision is thus proven.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry production is under threat from the emerging fungal pathogenic genus Cladosporium. We used amplicon-sequencing, coupled with qPCR, to investigate how fruit age, fruit location within a polytunnel, polytunnel location and sampling date affected the fruit epiphytic microbiome. Fruit age was the most important factor impacting the fungal microbiome, followed by sampling date and polytunnel location. In contrast, polytunnel location and fruit age were important factors impacting the bacterial microbiome composition, followed by the sampling date. The within-tunnel location had a small significant effect on the fungal microbiome and no effect on the bacterial microbiome. As fruit ripened, fungal diversity increased and the bacterial diversity decreased. Cladosporium was the most abundant fungus of the fruit epiphytic microbiome, accounting for nearly 44% of all fungal sequences. Rotorod air samplers were used to study how the concentration of airborne Cladosporium inoculum (quantified by qPCR) varied between location (inside and outside the polytunnel) and time (daytime vs. nighttime). Quantified Cladosporium DNA was significantly higher during the day than the night and inside the polytunnel than the outside. This study demonstrated the dynamic nature of epiphytic raspberry fruit microbiomes and airborne Cladosporium inoculum within polytunnels, which will impact disease risks on raspberry fruit.",

    "abstract": "We describe a Raspberry Pi-based camera system that is portable, robust and weatherproof, with a close-up focus (2.5\u2009cm). We show that this camera system can be used in remote locations with high rainfall and humidity. The camera has an Infrared LED light to film in dark places and can continuously record up to 21\u2009days (504\u2009h). We also describe how to make concrete artificial shelters to mount the camera in. One of the great strengths of this shelter/camera set-up is that the animals choose to take up residence and can then be filmed for extended periods with no disturbance. Furthermore, we give examples of how shelters and cameras could be used to film a range of behaviours in not only many small cryptic amphibian species but also other small vertebrates and invertebrates globally.",

    "abstract": "Intensive crop production leads to the disruption of the symbiosis between plants and their associated microorganisms, resulting in suboptimal plant productivity and lower yield quality. Therefore, it is necessary to improve existing methods and explore modern, environmentally friendly approaches to crop production. One of these methods is biotization, which involves the inoculation of plants with appropriately selected symbiotic microorganisms which play a beneficial role in plant adaptation to the environment. In this study, we tested the possibility of using a multi-microorganismal inoculum composed of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and AMF spore-associated bacteria for biotization of the red raspberry.\u00a0Bacteria were isolated from the spores of AMF, and their plant growth-promoting properties were tested. AMF inocula were supplemented with selected bacterial strains to investigate their effect on the growth and vitality of the raspberry. The investigations were carried out in the laboratory and on a semi-industrial scale in a polytunnel where commercial production of seedlings is carried out. In the semi-industrial experiment, we tested the growth parameters of plants and physiological response of the plant to temporary water shortage.\u00a0We isolated over fifty strains of bacteria associated with spores of AMF. Only part of them showed plant growth-promoting properties, and six of these (belonging to the Paenibacillus genus) were used for the inoculum. AMF inoculation and co-inoculation of AMF and bacteria isolated from AMF spores improved plant growth and vitality in both experimental setups. Plant dry weight was improved by 70%, and selected chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (the contribution of light to primary photochemistry and fraction of reaction centre chlorophyll per chlorophyll of the antennae) were increased. The inoculum improved carbon assimilation, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration after temporary water shortage. Raspberry biotization with AMF and bacteria associated with spores has potential applications in horticulture where ecological methods based on plant microorganism interaction are in demand.",

    "abstract": "A method to synthesize stable, raspberry-like nanoparticles (NPs), using surface grafting of poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) brushes on a polystyrene (PS) core with varying grafting densities, is reported. A two-step functionalization reaction of PGMA epoxide groups comprising an amination step first using ethylene diamine and then followed by a quaternization using glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride generates permanently and positively charged polyelectrolyte brushes, which result in both steric and electrostatic stabilization. The dispersion stability of the brush-bearing NPs is dramatically improved compared to that of the pristine PS core in salt solutions at ambient (25 \u00b0C) and elevated temperatures (60 \u00b0C). Additionally, the grafted polyelectrolyte chains undergo a reversible swelling in the presence of different ionic strength (IS) salts, which modulate the surface properties, including roughness, stiffness, and adhesion. An atomic force microscope under both dry and wet conditions was used to image conformational changes of the polyelectrolyte chains during the swelling and deswelling transitions as well as to probe the nanomechanical properties by analyzing the corresponding force-sample separation curves. The quaternized polyelectrolyte brushes undergo a conformational transition from a collapsed state to a swelled state in the osmotic brush (OB) regime triggered by the osmotic gradient of mobile ions to the interior of the polymer chain. At IS \u223c 1 M, the brushes contract and the globules reform (salted brush state) as evidenced by an increase in the surface roughness and a reduction in the adhesion of the brushes. Beyond IS \u223c 1 M, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring measurements show that salt uptake continues to take place predominantly on the exterior surface of the brush since salt adsorption is not accompanied by a size increase as measured by dynamic light scattering. The study adds new insights into our understanding of the behavior of NPs bearing salt-responsive polyelectrolyte brushes with adaptive swelling thresholds that can ultimately modulate surface properties.",

    "abstract": "The structure-activity relationship has been a hot topic in the field of polysaccharide research. Six polysaccharides and three polysaccharide fragments were obtained from raspberry pulp. Based on their structural information and immune-enhancing activity data, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was used for prediction, and Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) algorithm was exploited for explanation structure-activity relationship of these raspberry polysaccharides in the present study. The structural information and immune activity data of raspberry polysaccharides were respectively used as input and output in the ANN model. The training and testing losses of ANN model was no longer decreased after trained for 200 epochs. The mean-square error (MSE) of training set and test set stabilized around 0.003 and 0.013, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of training set and test set were 0.21\u00a0% and 0.98\u00a0%, indicating the trained ANN model converged well and exhibited strong robustness. The interpretability analysis showed that molecular weight, content of arabinose, galactose or galacturonic acid, and glycosyl linkage patterns of \u21923)-Arap-(1\u2192, Araf-(1\u2192, \u21924)-Galp-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0were the main structural factors greatly affecting the immune-enhancing activity of raspberry polysaccharides. This work may provide a new perspective for the study of structure-activity relationship of polysaccharides.",

    "abstract": "Phenolic compounds are considered an important group of bioactive molecules that are present in abundant quantities in fruits such as berries and cherries; hence, the analysis and quantification of these compounds are of significant interest to the scientific community. The current study aimed to develop a novel analytical method using liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) for the rapid, comprehensive and simultaneous analysis of 66 phenolic compounds optimized for the selected five types of fruits commercially available in Canada. Bioactive compounds that could potentially be metabolite markers for each berry were identified. Various phenolic compounds were identified and quantified in all five selected fruits. Notably, blackberries were rich in anthocyanins such as cyanidin-3-glucoside (368.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0\u00b5g/g), while blueberries were rich in peonidin-3-glucoside (1083\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09\u00a0\u00b5g/g). In addition, raspberries and cherries contained significant amounts of cyanidin-3-rutinoside, at 3156\u00a0\u00b1\u00a036\u00a0\u00b5g/g and 301.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b5g/g, respectively, while cranberries contained the highest concentrations of petunidin at 829.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0\u00b5g/g. The newly developed and validated UHPLC-HRMS method proved helpful in comprehensively analyzing phenolic compounds in blueberry, raspberry, cranberry, blackberry and cherry. Identifying and quantifying bioactives can lead to applications in neutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries by using phenolic-rich berry extracts in functional foods, supplements, or pharmaceutical products.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry leaves were subjected to steam explosion at 0.5 and 1.0\u00a0MPa for 60-120\u00a0s, aiming to disrupt their physical and chemical structure and, consequently, promote the release of phenolic compounds into the leaf aqueous infusion. Under optimal condition of 1.0\u00a0MPa for 60\u00a0s, steam explosion led to a notable 23\u00a0% increase in total phenolic content, a 29\u00a0% elevation in ABTS radical scavenging capacity, and a 13\u00a0% rise in DPPH radical scavenging capacity of the aqueous infusion. Utilizing UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS and UHPLC-QE-MS/MS techniques, respectively, a total of 39 phenolic compounds were identified from raspberry leaves, and the changes in the contents of the most important 11 species were analyzed following steam explosion. Through correlation analysis and considering the content of each phenolic compound, it was inferred that the heightened antioxidant capacity of the aqueous infusion primarily stemmed from a substantial increase in the release of ellagic acid after steam explosion.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is an important nectar source for honey production in some specific habitats as well as an important crop, so the definition of the features of this kind of honey is noteworthy. However, due to its rarity on the market, red raspberry honey is poorly characterized. The aim of this work was the phytochemical characterization of honey containing red raspberry from different geographical origins, through melissopalynological analyses concurrently with untargeted metabolomics achieved with different chromatographic techniques coupled to mass spectrometry: solid-phase micro-extraction/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography/Orbitrap mass spectrometry (HPLC-Orbitrap).\nOnly 4 out of the 12 samples involved in the study contained raspberry pollen as dominant pollen, although these honeys did not group in the hierarchical cluster analysis nor in the classical multidimensional scaling analyses used for data evaluation. The first result was the detection of mislabelling in two samples, which contained raspberry pollen only as minor or important minor pollen. Of the 188 compounds identified by HPLC-Orbitrap and of the 260 identified by SPME-GC-MS, 87 and 31 compounds were present in all samples, respectively. The structurally related compounds nicotinaldehyde and nicotinamide, nicotinic acid and nicotinyl alcohol were present in 100% of the samples and correlated with R. idaeus pollen count (r\u2009>\u20090.60, Pearson's correlation analysis).\nThis study reveals important aspects about the characterization of red raspberry honey and could give new insights on bee diet and preferences, since niacin compounds resulted interestingly to be related to the presence of red raspberry pollen. \u00a9 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and associated liver diseases are becoming global public health challenges. Raspberry (Rubus chingii Hu.), as a medicine food homology plant, possesses a series of health-promoting properties, but its protective effect on obesity-related liver injury and the potential mechanisms remain obscure. Herein high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice were orally treated with raspberry polysaccharides (RCP) for 14\u00a0weeks. Treatment with RCP alleviated obesity and associated symptoms including hyperglycemia, hyperlipemia, endotoxemia, as well as hepatic inflammation and oxidant stress in HFD-induced obese mice. RCP restructured the gut microbiota and host metabolism especially by increasing the levels of Dubosiella and its metabolite butyrate. Besides, exogenous butyrate supplementation protected against intestinal barrier disruption, and thereby reduced inflow of lipopolysaccharide and mitigated inflammation and oxidative injury in the liver of obese mice. Therefore, we suggest that RCP can be utilized as a novel prebiotics to improve obesity-induced hepatic oxidative injury by enhancing butyrate-mediated intestinal barrier function.",

RP ameliorated HFD-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, produced short-chain fatty acids, maintained intestinal barrier integrity, and prevented metabolic endotoxemia, manifested by decreased host lipopolysaccharide level, and increased colon expression of tight junction proteins. These effects might be related with driven by a SCFAs-producing bacterium and downregulation of TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling transduction. Notably, the abundance of Ruminococcaceae_UCG\u00a0-\u00a0014, Lactobacillus taiwanensis, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, and Turicibacter are markedly correlated with enhanced intestinal barrier function induced by RP treatment. Thus, we believe that RP could be as a potential health supplement or prebiotic for obesity therapy.",

    "abstract": "Pressure spray combined with high-voltage electrospray (PS-ES) has garnered considerable interest as a novel, non-thermal approach for microbial inactivation and preservation of liquid food. This study compared PS-ES with heat treatment (HT) to understand its inactivation mechanism against E. coli and S. aureus in a simulated system. Microbial activity, cell permeability, membrane integrity, membrane potential, and cell membrane structure were assessed. Furthermore, the impact of PS-ES treatment on microbial activity and flavor in honey raspberry juice, was examined. The changes in microbial growth and color during storage were also discussed. The experimental findings revealed that PS-ES treatment effectively reduced the number of E. coli and S. aureus by 1.99 and 1.83 log colony-forming units (CFU/mL). Additionally, it disrupted the integrity of bacterial cell membranes increasing their permeability, which led to the release of cellular proteins and nucleic acids. PS-ES treatment lowered the membrane potential and altered the structure of bacterial proteins. Application of PS-ES in honey raspberry juice reduced bacterial counts from 4.48 log CFU/mL to 1.99 log CFU/mL, with less flavor deterioration compared to HT treatment. After 30\u00a0days of storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and room temperature, PS-ES effectively controlled the growth of microorganisms in raspberry juice and maintained the color of the juice.",

    "abstract": "Cigarette smoke is a rich source of free radicals that can promote oxidative stress and carcinogenesis, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) development; importantly, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-isoprostane) are biomarkers of oxidative stress. Several mechanisms, including the antioxidant properties of black raspberry (BRB), account for their chemopreventive effects. In the present clinical trial, we tested the hypothesis that BRB administration reduces biomarkers levels of oxidative stress in buccal cells and urine of smokers. One week after enrolling 21 smokers, baseline buccal cells and urine samples were collected before the administration of BRB lozenges for 8 weeks (5/day, 1 gm BRB/lozenge). Buccal cells and urine samples were collected at the middle and the end of BRB administration. The last samples were collected after the BRB cessation (washout period). We analyzed levels of 8-oxodG and 8-isoprostane (LC/MS-MS), urinary cotinine (ELISA), and creatinine (spectrophotometry). BRB significantly reduced the levels of 8-oxodG by 17.08% (P = 0.00079) in buccal cells and 12.44% (P = 0.034) in urine at the middle of BRB administration as compared with baseline; the corresponding values at the end of BRB administration were 16.46% (P = 0.026) in buccal cells and 25.72% (P = 0.202) in urine. BRB had no significant effect on the levels of urinary 8-isoprostane. BRB's capacity to inhibit 8-oxodG formation of smokers' buccal cells and urine is clearly evident and the reduction in 8-oxodG suggests that antioxidant abilities are central to BRB's HNSCC chemopreventive properties.\nCigarette smoke contains highly active components namely free radicals that can promote oxidative stress and oral cancer. We found that black raspberry (BRB) inhibited the formation of oxidative stress markers in the oral cavity and urine of smokers suggesting the antioxidant abilities of BRB in preventing oral cancer.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is recognized as a chronic low-grade inflammation associated with intestinal flora imbalance, leading to dyslipidemia and inflammation. Modern research has found that polyphenols have anti-obesity effects. However, the mechanism of action of raspberry leaf extract (RLE) with high polyphenols in regulating obesity is still unknown. This study investigated the improvement effect of supplementing RLE on high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity in mice.\nRLE was used to intervene in HFD induced C57BL/6J male mice during prevention stage (1-16 weeks) and treatment stage (17-20 weeks). Their weight changes and obesity-related biochemical indicators were measured. The changes in intestinal flora were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing, and finally the targets and pathways of the 7 typical polyphenols (quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, ellagic acid, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, chlorogenic acid, brevifolin carboxylic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, and quercetin) of RLE in the regulation of obesity were predicted by network pharmacology approach.\nThe results showed that RLE effectively prevented and treated weight gain in obese mice induced by HFD, alleviated adipocyte hypertrophy, reduced Interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha levels, and improved intestinal flora, especially \nThe potential mechanism by which polyphenol-rich RLE regulates obesity may be attributed to the specific polyphenols of RLE and their synergistic effects, therefore RLE has a great anti-obesity potential and may be used as a means to alleviate obesity and related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Rubus yellow net virus (RYNV) belongs to genus Badnavirus. Badnaviruses are found in plants as endogenous, inactive or activatable sequences, and/or in episomal (infectious and active) forms. To assess the state of RYNV in Rubus germplasm, we sequenced the genomes of various cultivars and mined eight raspberry whole genome datasets. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of a diverse array of endogenous RYNV (endoRYNV) sequences that differ significantly in their structure; some lineages have nearly complete, yet non-functional genomes whereas others have rudimentary, short sequence fragments. We developed assays to genotype the main lineages as well as the only known episomal lineage present in the United States. This study discloses the widespread presence of endoRYNVs in commercial raspberries, likely because breeding efforts have focused on a limited pool of germplasm that harbored endoRYNVs.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 650,000 new cases of heart failure (HF) are diagnosed annually with a 50% five-year mortality rate. HF is characterized by reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and hypertrophy of the LV wall. The pathophysiological remodeling of the heart is mediated by increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Raspberries are rich in polyphenols which may favorably impact enzymes involved in redox homeostasis while also targeting inflammatory signaling. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate whether raspberry polyphenols could attenuate HF. Sprague Dawley rats consumed a 10% (w/w) raspberry diet for 7 weeks. At week 3, HF was surgically induced via coronary artery ligation. Hemodynamics and morphology of the heart were assessed. Expression of cardiac proteins involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and remodeling were examined, and histological analysis was conducted. Additionally, human cardiomyocytes were treated with raspberry polyphenol extract (RBPE) followed by CoCl",

This voltammetry is dominated by the oxidation of anthocyanins. It was hypothesized that under conditions of electrochemical generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), new anthocyanin-derived species with high antioxidant capacity are formed over a wide pH range. In the case of ROS-activated anthocyanins, electrochemical oxidation is associated with loss of sugar moieties. Experimental voltammetric and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) imaging data consistent with this hypothesis are presented.",

    "abstract": "Gut dysbiosis is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with uremic toxin production, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular disease development. Therefore, healthy dietary patterns are essential modulators of gut microbiota. In this context, studies suggest that consuming berry fruits, rich in polyphenols and nutrients, may positively affect the gut microbiota, promoting the selective growth of beneficial bacteria and improving clinical status. However, studies on the effects of berry fruits on gut microbiota in CKD are scarce, and a better understanding of the possible mechanisms of action of berry fruits on gut microbiota is needed to guide future clinical studies and clinical practice in CKD. The objective was to discuss how berry fruits (blueberry, cranberry, raspberry, and strawberry) could be a therapeutic strategy to modulate the gut microbiota and possibly reverse the dysbiosis in CKD. Overall, available evidence shows that berry fruits can promote an increase in diversity by affecting the abundance of mucus-producing bacteria and short-chain fatty acids. Moreover, these fruits can increase the expression of mRNA involved in tight junctions in the gut such as occludin, tight junction protein 1 (TJP1), and mucin. Studies on the exact amount of berries leading to these effects show heterogeneous findings. However, it is known that, with 5\u2009mg/day, it is already possible to observe some effects in animal models. Wild berries could possibly improve the uremic condition by reducing the levels of uremic toxins via modulation of the gut microbiota. In the long term, this could be an excellent strategy for patients with CKD. Therefore, clinical studies are encouraged to evaluate better these effects on CKD as well as the safe amount of these fruits in order to promote a better quality of life or even the survival of these patients.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the influence of two carrier agents, Nopal and Aloe Vera mucilage on the physicochemical properties and stability of blackberry and raspberry powders obtained by spray drying. A pilot scale spray dryer with a feed flow of 20 L/h and an atomization speed of 28,000\u2005rpm was used. The inlet and outlet air temperatures were from 180 to 80 \u00b0C, respectively. Yield, moisture content, water activity, hygroscopicity index, solubility time, volumetric density, stability diagrams, micrographs, and particle temperature were evaluated. The highest yields for blackberry extract were 75% with a concentration of 2.5% (w/v) Nopal mucilage, while raspberry extract yielded 65% with a concentration of 5% (w/v) Nopal mucilage. The increase in the concentration of the carrier agent presented an increase in the values of humidity, water activity, volumetric density, and solubility when Nopal mucilage was used as a carrier agent in both blackberry and raspberry extracts. Furthermore, when Aloe Vera mucilage was used as a carrier agent, these same values decreased with increasing concentration. The storage conditions of the powders obtained should be stored at temperatures below 20\u00b0C and water activities below 0.4. In addition, the stability diagrams show the particle conditions that should not be exceeded during spray drying.",
