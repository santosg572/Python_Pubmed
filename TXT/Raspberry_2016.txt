    "abstract": "Impedance Cardiography (ICG) is a non-invasive method for monitoring cardiac dynamics using Electrical Bioimpedance (EBI) measurements. Since its appearance more than 40 years ago, ICG has been used for assessing hemodynamic parameters. This paper present a measurement system based on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing both a full 3-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a platform supporting Do-It-Yourself project and education applications across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933. The recording were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC, where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely available and affordable components, for supporting developers in research and engineering education. The design and development documents, will be available on www.BiosignalPI.com, for open access under a Non Commercial-Share A like 4.0 International License.",

Choose 72 mice castrated completely random divided into 6 groups for the experiment, respectively: model group, gengnianan (GNA) capsule group, soybean isoflavone soft (SIS) capsule group, high, mid and low dose group of total flavonoids of raspberry (TFR). Animals in each group were given the corresponding drugs tenth days after operation, and were given intragastrical administration of once a day for continuous administration of 21\u00a0days. Each group of mice in the administration of 18\u00a0days to determine the number of autonomic activities within 5\u00a0min, in the administration of 19-20\u00a0days to determine the incubation of the mice first entry into the darkroom and the number of shocks into the darkroom within 5\u00a0min. At 2\u00a0h after the last administration (fasting for 12\u00a0h), mice were sacrificed and serum was collected. Serum levels of E2, T, LH and FSH were measured. Dissect the uterus, uterus, thymus and spleen. Weigh the wet weight and calculate the organ index, the morphological changes of uterus, thymus and spleen were observed. The results showed that the TFR had a good therapeutic effect on the perimenopausal model of mice after giving a high, mid and low dose of raspberry flavonoids for some time.",

    "abstract": "Plant protection products (PPPs) have been found increasingly in the environment. They pose a huge threat to bees, contributing to honeybee colony losses and consequently to enormous economic losses. Therefore, this field investigation was designed to determine whether their active ingredients (AIs) were transferred from raspberry plants to beehives located in the immediate neighbourhood of the crop and to what extent they were transferred. Every week for 2\u00a0months, samples of soil, raspberry leaves, flowers and fruits, worker bees, honeybee brood, and honey were collected and analysed for the presence of propyzamide, chlorpyrifos, iprodione, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, cypermethrin, difenoconazole, azoxystrobin, and pyrimethanil residues. Five of these substances were found in the worker bee bodies. Chlorpyrifos, applied to only the soil through the irrigation system, also was detected in the brood. A small amount of boscalid was noted in the honey, but its residues did not exceed the maximum residue level. For chlorpyrifos, boscalid, and pyrimethanil, a positive correlation between the occurrence of PPPs in the crops and the beehives was found. Statistical methods confirmed that the application of PPPs on a raspberry plantation, as an example of nectar-secreting plants, was linked to the transfer of their AIs to beehives.",

    "abstract": "Berries are a rich source of antioxidants and phytochemicals that have received considerable interest for their possible relations to human health. In this study, the anti-adipogenic effect of polyphenol-rich extract obtained from chokeberry Aronia melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliot, raspberry Rubus idaeus L., bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus L. and cranberry Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton fruits and its underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipose cells. Treatment with the extract (25-100 \u03bcg/mL) significantly decreased lipid accumulation and reactive oxygen species generation in adipocytes without showing cytotoxicity. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the extract at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/mL suppressed adipogenesis and lipogenesis via the down-regulation of PPAR\u03b3 (67%), C/EBP\u03b1 (72%), SREBP1 (62%), aP2 (24%), FAS (32%), LPL (40%), HSL (39%), and PLIN1 (32%) gene expression. Moreover, the extract significantly increased the expression of adiponectin (4.4-fold) and decreased leptin expression (90%) and respectively regulated the production of these adipokines in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The obtained results suggest that the analyzed extract may be a promising source of bioactive compounds that support long-term weight maintenance and promote the effective management of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Among older adults, falls are a leading cause of distress, pain, injury, loss of confidence, and ultimately, loss of independence and death. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that berry supplementation improves the age-related declines in balance, muscle strength, and coordination that often lead to falls, even when initiated later in life. The purpose of this study was to explore the interaction between baseline motor performance and the daily intake of raspberry required to improve/preserve motor function. Aged male F344 (17 mo) rats were tested for baseline (pre-test) balance, muscle strength, and coordination, and divided into good, average, and poor performers based on their motor composite score. Rats in each category were fed with either a control, 1%, or 2% raspberry-supplemented diet for 8 weeks and then retested (post-test). Poor performers fed with 1% or 2% raspberry had higher post-test composite scores (p < 0.05), while 2% raspberry lowered post-test composite scores in the good performers (p < 0.05), compared to control-fed rats. 1% and 2% raspberry appeared to preserve the performance of good performers and improve the performance of poor performers on plank walking (p < 0.05), while 2% raspberry improved post-test grip strength of the poor performers (p < 0.05). Additionally, rats with lower post-diet composite scores had higher levels of serum IL-1\u03b2 levels (r = -0.347, p < 0.05). These findings identified poor performers as being the most likely to benefit from daily consumption of \u00bd-2 cups of raspberry to improve/preserve motor function. Therefore, increased raspberry consumption may reduce fall risk, extend independence, and improve quality of life in the aging population.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the antiobesity effects of raspberry ketone (RK), one of the major aromatic compounds contained in raspberry, and its underlying mechanisms. During adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells, RK (300 \u03bcM) significantly reduced lipid accumulation and downregulated the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1), peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), and fatty acid synthase (FAS). RK also reduced the expression of light chain 3B (LC3B), autophagy-related protein 12 (Atg12), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and phosphorylated-tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), whereas it increased the level of p62 and phosphorylated-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Daily administration of RK decreased the body weight (ovariectomy [Ovx] + RK, 352.6 \u00b1 5 vs Ovx, 386 \u00b1 5.8 g; P < 0.05), fat mass (Ovx + RK, 3.2 \u00b1 0.05 vs Ovx, 5.0 \u00b1 0.4 g; P < 0.05), and fat cell size (Ovx + RK, 6.4 \u00b1 0.6 vs Ovx, 11.1 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 10",

    "abstract": "Plant science uses increasing amounts of phenotypic data to unravel the complex interactions between biological systems and their variable environments. Originally, phenotyping approaches were limited by manual, often destructive operations, causing large errors. Plant imaging emerged as a viable alternative allowing non-invasive and automated data acquisition. Several procedures based on image analysis were developed to monitor leaf growth as a major phenotyping target. However, in most proposals, a time-consuming parameterization of the analysis pipeline is required to handle variable conditions between images, particularly in the field due to unstable light and interferences with soil surface or weeds. To cope with these difficulties, we developed a low-cost, 2D imaging method, hereafter called PYM. The method is based on plant leaf ability to absorb blue light while reflecting infrared wavelengths. PYM consists of a Raspberry Pi computer equipped with an infrared camera and a blue filter and is associated with scripts that compute projected leaf area. This new method was tested on diverse species placed in contrasting conditions. Application to field conditions was evaluated on lettuces grown under photovoltaic panels. The objective was to look for possible acclimation of leaf expansion under photovoltaic panels to optimise the use of solar radiation per unit soil area.\nThe new PYM device proved to be efficient and accurate for screening leaf area of various species in wide ranges of environments. In the most challenging conditions that we tested, error on plant leaf area was reduced to 5% using PYM compared to 100% when using a recently published method. A high-throughput phenotyping cart, holding 6 chained PYM devices, was designed to capture up to 2000 pictures of field-grown lettuce plants in less than 2\u00a0h. Automated analysis of image stacks of individual plants over their growth cycles revealed unexpected differences in leaf expansion rate between lettuces rows depending on their position below or between the photovoltaic panels.\nThe imaging device described here has several benefits, such as affordability, low cost, reliability and flexibility for online analysis and storage. It should be easily appropriated and customized to meet the needs of various users.",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging is a technology that can be used to monitor plant responses to stress. Hyperspectral images have a full spectrum for each pixel in the image, 400-2500\u00a0nm in this case, giving detailed information about the spectral reflectance of the plant. Although this technology has been used in laboratory-based controlled lighting conditions for early detection of plant disease, the transfer of such technology to imaging plants in field conditions presents a number of challenges. These include problems caused by varying light levels and difficulties of separating the target plant from its background. Here we present an automated method that has been developed to segment raspberry plants from the background using a selected spectral ratio combined with edge detection. Graph theory was used to minimise a cost function to detect the continuous boundary between uninteresting plants and the area of interest. The method includes automatic detection of a known reflectance tile which was kept constantly within the field of view for all image scans. A method to split images containing rows of multiple raspberry plants into individual plants was also developed. Validation was carried out by comparison of plant height and density measurements with manually scored values. A reasonable correlation was found between these manual scores and measurements taken from the images (r",

    "abstract": "Raspberry (Rubus spp.) is an economically important crop with a restricted growing season and very limited fruit shelf-life due to its extreme tenderness. In order to prolong its shelf life, an aqueous composition containing hexanal as the key active ingredient (HC) was applied as a preharvest spray during fruit development. The effects of HC were assessed using physiological, biochemical and anatomical parameters on the treated fruits and compared with the effects of mock inoculation which lacked hexanal. Sugars and acidity did not show a significant change in response to HC treatment, while the pulling force (the tension required to detach the berry from the receptacle) significantly improved in the HC-treated fruits, compared to control. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed a high correlation between the presence of rigid epidermal hairs and a stronger degree of attachment between berries and their receptacle in the HC treated fruits. Further, electron micrographs also showed abnormal crystalline depositions on the epidermal drupelets of the treated berries. Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis showed those crystals to be largely composed of calcium. HC treatment also resulted in the reduction of transcript level of three phospholipase D genes, as well as altered expression pattern of five members of the annexin gene family, and four calmodulin-binding transcription activators. Quantification of PLD activity showed that hexanal inhibited PLD activity in treated berries. The potential crosstalk between hexanal, phospholipase D activity and calcium and this crosstalk's role in delaying fruit softening and in prolonging storage life of fruits shelf life is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberries (BRB) have been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in a number of systems, with most studies focusing on progression. Previously we reported that an anthocyanin-enriched black raspberry extract (BE) enhanced repair of dibenzo-[a,l]-pyrene dihydrodiol (DBP-diol)-induced DNA adducts and inhibited DBP-diol and DBP-diolepoxide (DBPDE)-induced mutagenesis in a lacI rat oral fibroblast cell line, suggesting a role for BRB in the inhibition of initiation of carcinogenesis. Here we extend this work to protection by BE against DNA adduct formation induced by dibenzo-[a,l]-pyrene (DBP) in a human oral leukoplakia cell line (MSK) and to a second carcinogen, UV light. Treatment of MSK cells with DBP and DBPDE led to a dose-dependent increase in DBP-DNA adducts. Treatment of MSK cells with BE after addition of DBP reduced levels of adducts relative to cells treated with DBP alone, and treatment of rat oral fibroblasts with BE after addition of DBPDE inhibited mutagenesis. These observations showed that BE affected repair of DNA adducts and not metabolism of DBP. As a proof of principle we also tested aglycones of two anthocyanins commonly found in berries, delphinidin chloride and pelargonidin chloride. Delphinidin chloride reduced DBP-DNA adduct levels in MSK cells, while PGA did not. These results suggested that certain anthocyanins can enhance repair of bulky DNA adducts. As DBP and its metabolites induced formation of bulky DNA adducts, we investigated the effects of BE on genotoxic effects of a second carcinogen that induces bulky DNA damage, UV light. UV irradiation produced a dose-dependent increase in cyclobutanepyrimidine dimer levels in MSK cells, and post-UV treatment with BE resulted in lower cyclobutanepyrimidine dimer levels. Post-UV treatment of the rat lacI cells with BE reduced UV-induced mutagenesis. Taken together, the results demonstrate that BE extract reduces bulky DNA damage and mutagenesis and support a role for BRB in the inhibition of initiation of carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Protein-polysaccharide interactions offer opportunities for designing the new functional foods with applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. In this work, we microencapsulated black raspberry water extracts by double emulsion technique prior to complex coacervation using gelatin and gum Arabic to diminish the instability of their anthocyanins (ANCs) as water soluble compounds, particularly under harsh processing and storage conditions. Subsequently, optical microscopy, moisture, hygroscopicity, solubility, particle size, loading capacity, zeta potential, color parameters (L*, a*, b*, C, H\u00b0 and TCD), stability, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermal behavior were evaluated. The microcapsules presented the lower moisture, hygroscopicity and solubility values as comparing the free form of ANCs. They showed the average sizes ranging from 35.34\u00b13.21 to 80.22\u00b15.21\u03bcm and high loading capacity (29.67\u00b10.66-38.54\u00b10.08%). According to the HPLC results, the selected method significantly increased the stability of ANCs up to 23.66% after 2 months of storage at 37\u00b12\u00b0C. FT-IR spectra confirmed the negative zeta potential values of microcapsules and the occurrence of coacervation process. DSC results evidenced the thermostability of microcapsules. Furthermore, the selected optimal microcapsules revealed intense red color over the time of storage, implying the effectiveness of the method chosen to preserve anthocyanins.",

    "abstract": "High tunnels are large protective structures used for season extension of many crops, including raspberries. These structures are often covered in plastic films to reduce and diffuse ultraviolet light transmission for pest and disease control, but this may also affect the photodegradation and efficacy of pesticides applied under these tunnels. We compared the residue levels of ten insecticides under three tunnel plastics with varying levels of UV transmission and open field conditions. Raspberry plants placed in research-scale tunnels were treated with insecticides and residues on fruit and foliage were monitored for one or two weeks in early 2015 and early and late 2016. Plastics that reduce UV transmission resulted in 50% greater residues of some insecticides compared to transparent plastics, and 60% compared to uncovered tunnels. This increased persistence of residues was evident within 1 day and remained consistently higher for up to 14 days. This pattern was demonstrated for multiple insecticides, including bifenthrin, esfenvalerate, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and spinosad. In contrast, the insecticide malathion degraded rapidly regardless of the plastic treatment, indicating less sensitivity to photodegradation. Bioassays using insecticide-treated leaves that were under UV-blocking plastic revealed higher mortality of the invasive fruit pest, Drosophila suzukii, compared to leaves that were uncovered. This indicates that the activity of pesticides under high tunnels covered in UV-reducing plastics may be prolonged, allowing for fewer insecticide applications and longer intervals between sprays. This information can be used to help optimize pest control in protected culture berry production.",

    "abstract": "The beneficial effects of consumption of berry fruits on a range of chronic diseases has been attributed (at least in part) to the presence of unique phytochemicals. Recently, we identified novel ursolic acid-based triterpenoid glycosides (TTPNs) in raspberry fruit and demonstrated their survival in human ileal fluids after feeding which confirmed their colon-availability in vivo. In this paper, in vitro digestion studies demonstrated that certain TTPNs were stable under gastrointestinal conditions and confirmed that these components may have been responsible for bioactivity noted in previous studies. Sequential extractions of raspberry puree, isolated seeds and unseeded puree showed that certain TTPN components (e.g. peak T1 m/z 679, and T2 m/z 1358) had different extractabilities in water/solvent mixes and were differentially associated with the seeds. Purified seed TTPNs (mainly T1 and T2) were shown to be anti-genotoxic in HT29 and CCD841 cell based in vitro colonocyte models. Further work confirmed that the seeds contained a wider range of TTPN-like components which were also differentially extractable in water/solvent mixes. This differential extractability could influence the TTPN composition and potential bioactivity of the extracts. There was considerable variation in total content of TTPNs (\u223c3-fold) and TTPN composition across 13 Rubus genotypes. Thus, TTPNs are likely to be present in raspberry juices and common extracts used for bioactivity studies and substantial variation exists in both content and composition due to genetics, tissue source or extraction conditions, which may all affect observed bioactivity.",

    "abstract": "Botrytis fruit rot (BFR), one of the most important diseases of raspberry (Rubus spp.), is controlled primarily with fungicides. Despite the use of fungicides, crop losses due to BFR are high in most years. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between airborne inoculum, weather variables, and BFR in order to improve the management of the disease as well as harvest and storage decisions. Crop losses, measured as the percentage of diseased berries during the harvest period, were monitored in unsprayed field plots at four sites in three successive years, together with meteorological data and the number of conidia in the air. Based on windowpane analysis, there was no evidence of correlation between crop losses and temperature, vapor pressure deficit, wind, solar radiation, or probability of infection. There were significant correlations between crop losses and airborne inoculum and between crop losses and humidity-related variables, and the best window length was identified as 7 days. Using 7-day average airborne inoculum concentration combined with 7-day average relative humidity for periods ending 6 to 8 days before bloom, it was possible to accurately predict crop losses (R",

    "abstract": "Rodent models of neurological disease such as stroke are often characterized by motor deficits. One of the tests that are used to assess these motor deficits is the tapered beam test, which provides a sensitive measure of bilateral motor function based on foot faults (slips) made by a rodent traversing a gradually narrowing beam. However, manual frame-by-frame scoring of video recordings is necessary to obtain test results, which is time-consuming and prone to human rater bias.\nWe present a cost-effective method for automated touch sensing in the tapered beam test. Capacitive touch sensors detect foot faults onto the beam through a layer of conductive paint, and results are processed and stored on a Raspberry Pi computer.\nAutomated touch sensing using this method achieved high sensitivity (96.2%) as compared to 'gold standard' manual video scoring. Furthermore, it provided a reliable measure of lateralized motor deficits in mice with unilateral photothrombotic stroke: results indicated an increased number of contralesional foot faults for up to 6days after ischemia.\nThe automated adaptation of the tapered beam test produces results immediately after each trial, without the need for labor-intensive post-hoc video scoring. It also increases objectivity of the data as it requires less experimenter involvement during analysis.\nAutomated touch sensing may provide a useful adaptation to the existing tapered beam test in mice, while the simplicity of the hardware lends itself to potential further adaptations to related behavioral tests.",

    "abstract": "Tephritid fruit flies are amongst the most damaging insect pests of horticulture globally. Some of the key fruit fly species are managed using the sterile insect technique (SIT), whereby millions of sterile males are released to suppress reproduction of pest populations. Male annihilation technique (MAT), whereby sex specific lures are used to attract and kill males, is often used to reduce wild male numbers before SIT programs commence, providing released sterile males an increased numerical advantage. Overall program efficacy might be improved if MAT could be deployed simultaneously with SIT, continuously depleting fertile males from pest populations and replacing them with sterile males. However, such 'male replacement' requires a means of suppressing attraction of released sterile males to lures used in MAT. Previous studies have found that exposure of some fruit flies to lure compounds as mature adults can suppress subsequent response to those lures, raising the possibility of pre-release treatments. However, this approach requires holding flies until after maturation for treatment and then release. The present study takes a novel approach of exposing immature adult male Queensland fruit flies (Bactrocera tryoni, or 'Qfly') to raspberry ketone (RK) mixed in food, forcing these flies to ingest RK at ages far younger than they would naturally. After feeding on RK-supplemented food for two days after emergence, male Qflies exhibited a reduction in attraction to cuelure traps that lasted more than 20 days. This approach to RK exposure is compatible with current practises, in which Qflies are released as immature adults, and also yields advantages of accelerated reproductive development and increased mating propensity at young ages.",

    "abstract": "The production of activated carbons (ACs) from rapeseed cake and raspberry seed cake using slow pyrolysis followed by physical activation of the obtained solid residues is the topic of this study. The effect of activation temperature (850, 900 and 950 \u00b0C), activation time (30, 60, 90 and 120 min) and agent (steam and CO\u2082) on the textural characteristics of the ACs is investigated by N\u2082 adsorption. In general, higher activation temperatures and longer activation times increase the BET specific surface area and the porosity of the ACs, regardless of the activation agent or raw material. Steam is more reactive than CO\u2082 in terms of pore development, especially in the case of raspberry seed cake. The performance of the ACs in liquid adsorption is evaluated by batch phenol adsorption tests. Experimental data are best fitted by the Freundlich isotherm model. Based on total yield, textural characteristics and phenol adsorption, steam activation at 900 \u00b0C for 90 min and CO\u2082 activation at 900 \u00b0C for 120 min are found as the best activation conditions. Raspberry seed cake turns out to be a better raw material than rapeseed cake. Moreover, AC from raspberry seed cake produced by steam activation at 900 \u00b0C for 90 min performs as well as commercial AC (Norit GAC 1240) in phenol adsorption. The adsorption kinetics of the selected ACs are best fitted by the pseudo-second-order model.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila suzukii Matsumura is a serious pest of small fruits that lays its eggs in growing fruit. Current management strategies rely on an unsustainable schedule of foliar applications of chemical insecticides. Alternative approaches to suppressing oviposition are under investigation, such as attract-and-kill and the use of oviposition deterrents. Here, we evaluated two behavioral control approaches in combination as a push-pull strategy using laboratory and field assays.\nIn laboratory caged assays, both an attractive mass trapping device (pull) and an oviposition deterrent (push: 1-octen-3-ol) reduced oviposition by D. suzukii, and the combination of the two (push-pull) resulted in significantly greater reduction than either treatment alone. In field experiments, oviposition reduction was observed in fruit from plots treated with oviposition deterrent (push) or a combination of mass trapping devices and deterrent (push-pull) compared with fruit from control plots. However, oviposition in plots with mass trapping devices (pull) was higher than observed in all other treatments. Additionally, the protection provided by the deterrent in push plots extended to the entire plot rather than just in fruit closest to deterrent dispensers.\nPush-pull treatments negatively affected D. suzukii infestation in both laboratory and field experiments. The reduction in oviposition observed in laboratory experiments was based on the additive effect of push and pull components acting on a finite population, while the reduction observed in field experiments appeared to be mainly based on the effect of pull components. We discuss potential underlying reasons for the discrepancy results and suggest potential improvements. \u00a9 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "abstract": "Terpolymer raspberry vesicles contain domains of different chemical affinities. They are potential candidates as multi-compartment cargo carriers. Their efficacy depends on their stability and load capacity. Using a model star terpolymer system in an aqueous solution, a dissipative particle dynamic (DPD) simulation is employed to investigate how equilibrium aggregate structures are affected by polymer concentration and pairwise interaction energy in a solution. It is shown that a critical mass of polymer is necessary for vesicle formation. The free energy of the equilibrium aggregates are calculated and the results show that the transition from micelles to vesicles is governed by the interactions between the longest solvophobic block and the solvent. In addition, the ability of vesicles to encapsulate solvent is assessed. It is found that reducing the interaction energy favours solvent encapsulation, although solvent molecules can permeate through the vesicle's shell when repulsive interactions among monomers are low. Thus, one can optimize the loading capacity and the release rate of the vesicles by turning pairwise interaction energies of the polymer and the solvent. The ability to predict and control these aspects of the vesicles is an essential step towards designing vesicles for specific purposes.",

    "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX) is an antimetabolite drug commonly prescribed for the various cancers and autoimmune diseases. Despite its considerable therapeutic effects, nephrotoxicity is the most important side-effect of treatment with MTX. Aquaporin1 (AQP1) is a water channel proteins which is present in mammalian kidney. Raspberry fruit with antioxidant properties is able to protect biological systems from the harmful effects of free radicals. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of raspberry extract on expression of AQP1 and the MTX-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.\nIn this experimental study, 60 adult male Wistar rats were divided into nine groups including control, sham, MTX treated group [single dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight (BW) MTX at the third day], raspberry treated groups [intraperitoneal (I.P) injection of 100, 200, 400 mg/kg of BW raspberry extract for ten consecutive days], MTX and raspberry treated groups. At day 11, rats were sacrificed via chloroform inhalation and kidney tissues were fixed in formalin solution for histological and immunohistochemistry analysis. The serological assays for urea, creatinine, uric acid and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were also performed.\nMTX elevated serum level of the urea, creatinine, uric acid, IL-6, renal tissue damage and decreased the AQP1 expression level. Raspberry fruit extract improved the kidney function and reduced side effects of MTX in treated rats. Expression of AQP1, in a dose dependent manner was also ameliorated, as compared to control group.\nAccording to the findings of this study, it can be concluded that biological activity of compounds presented in raspberry fruit extract especially anthocyanins may have chemo-protective effect on kidney function and AQP1 expression in rats treated by MTX.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is caused by excessive accumulation of body fat and is closely related to complex metabolic diseases. Raspberry ketone (RK), a major aromatic compound in red raspberry, was recently reported to possess anti-obesity effects. However, its mechanisms are unclear.\nAdipogenesis plays a critical role in obesity and, therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanisms of action of RK on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.\n3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated in medium containing insulin, dexamethasone, and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. Adipocyte lipid contents were determined using oil-red O staining while adipogenic transcription factor and lipogenic protein expressions were determined using western blotting.\nRK (300-400\u00b5M) strongly inhibited lipid accumulation during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation into adipocytes. RK reduced the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-\u03b1 (C/EBP-\u03b1), peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) expressions and increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), Wnt10b, and \u03b2-catenin expressions in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Additionally, RK inhibited lipid accumulation, and adipogenic transcription factor and lipogenic protein expressions were all decreased by inhibiting HO-1 or \u03b2-catenin using tin protoporphyrin (SnPP) or \u03b2-catenin short-interfering RNA (siRNA), respectively. Furthermore, Wnt10b and \u03b2-catenin expressions were negatively regulation by SnPP.\nRK may exert anti-adipogenic effects through modulation of the HO-1/Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.",

The mesoporous siliceous support of SiO\u2082 KIT-6-incorporated BiOCl with enlarged yet refined surface morphology characterized by physiochemical methods exhibits an improved electrochemical performance. A sensitive electrochemical detection method of cadmium concentration using square wave anodic stripping voltammetry was developed based on BiOCl-SiO\u2082 KIT-6 composite-modified glassy carbon electrodes, which displayed wide linear ranges of 0.5 to 10 \u03bcg/L and 10 to 300 \u03bcg/L and a detection limit of 65 ng/L. The sensitive, versatile and eco-friendly sensor was successfully applied for the determination of cadmium-spiked human blood samples.",

    "abstract": "We report on the development of raspberry-like silica structures formed by the adsorption of 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (HPTS)@silica nanoparticles (NPs) on rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RBTIC)@silica NPs for ratiometric fluorescence-based pH sensing. To overcome the well-known problem of dye leaching which occurs during encapsulation of anionic HPTS dye in silica NPs, we utilized a polyelectrolyte-assisted incorporation of the anionic HPTS. The morphological and optical characterization of the as-synthesized dye-doped NPs and the resulting nanohybrids were carried out. The pH-sensitive dye, HPTS, incorporated in the HPTS-doped silica NPs provided a pH-dependent fluorescence response while the RBITC-doped silica provided the reference signal for ratiometric sensing. We evaluated the effectiveness of the nanohybrids for pH sensing; the ratio of the fluorescence emission intensity at 510\u2005nm and 583\u2005nm at excitation wavelengths of 454\u2005nm and 555\u2005nm, respectively. The results showed a dynamic response in the acidic pH range. With this approach, nanohybrids containing different dyes or receptors could be developed for multifunctioning and multiplexing applications.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis of polyaniline-silica composites has been reinvestigated in view of the opposing results found in the literature. Firstly, we synthesized silica particles with tunable size using the St\u00f6ber process. These silica particles have been fully characterized before being used as solid support for the polymerization of aniline. This polymerization was performed according to a published procedure where the pH of the reaction mixture was below the pKa of aniline but at a value where the silica particles surface was still slightly negatively charged. The objective of this procedure was to favor electrostatic interactions between anilinium cations and the silica surface to lead to the formation of silica-polyaniline core-shell particles. Several sets of nanocomposites were prepared under different experimental conditions (oxidant/aniline ratio, silica concentration, temperature, silica particles diameters). The study evidenced that under all the conditions used the formation of core-shell nanoparticles is impossible. However, using different particle sizes, noticeable morphological differences were observed. The use of large silica particles led to the formation of non-uniform polyaniline-silica composites whereas the use of smaller particles always led to raspberry-like morphology as reported by other groups in highly acidic media. The difference in morphology led to different electrical properties with electrical conductivities measured at room temperature ranging from 1.6\u00d710",

    "abstract": "Operant training systems make use of water or food restriction and make it necessary to weigh animals to ensure compliance with experimental endpoints. In other applications periodic weighing is necessary to assess drug side-effects, or as an endpoint in feeding experiments. Periodic weighing while essential can disrupt animal circadian rhythms and social structure.\nAutomatic weighing system within paired mouse homecages. Up to 10 mice freely move between two cages (28\u00d718\u00d79cm) which were connected by a weighing chamber mounted on a load cell. Each mouse was identified using an RFID tag placed under the skin of the neck. A single-board computer (Raspberry Pi; RPi) controls the task, logging RFID tag, load cell weights, and time stamps from each RFID detection until the animal leaves the chamber. Collected data were statistically analyzed to estimate mouse weights. We anticipate integration with tasks where automated imaging or behaviour is assessed in homecages.\nMice frequently move between the two cages, an average of 42+-16 times/day/mouse at which time we obtained weights. We report accurate determination of mouse weight and long term monitoring over 53days. Comparison with existing methods Although commercial systems are available for automatically weighing rodents, they only work with single animals, or are not open source nor cost effective for specific custom application.\nThis automated system permits automated weighing of mice \u223c40 times per day. The system employs inexpensive hardware and open-source Python code.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of dietary raspberry pomace as a rich source of biologically active compounds on microbial activity and the BA profile in the caecum of rats fed a high-fat diet. Wistar rats were fed the standard diet AIN-93, a high-fat diet or a modified high-fat diet enriched with 7% different types of processed raspberry pomaces produced by standard grinding and fine grinding, with or without seeds. Rats fed the high-fat diet for 8 weeks showed some disorders in liver function and cecal BA, as manifested by an increased concentration of cholesterol, total BA in the liver and cholic, deoxycholic, and \u03b2-muricholic acids in the cecal digesta. In general, irrespective of the type of raspberry pomace, these dietary preparations decreased liver cholesterol, hepatic fibroblast growth factor receptor 4, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, cecal ammonia and favorable changed BA profile in the cecum. However, among all dietary pomaces, the finely ground preparation containing seeds had the greatest beneficial effect on the caecum by modulating bacterial activity and reducing the levels of secondary BA.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry-like nano-objects made of large plasmonic satellites (>10 nm) covering a central dielectric particle have many potential applications as photonic materials, superlenses and (bio-) sensors, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we show how to build stable and robust raspberry-like nano-systems with close-packed satellites, by combining monodisperse silica particles (80 or 100 nm diameter) and oppositely charged noble metal nanoparticles (Au or Ag) with well-defined sizes (10-50 nm). The spectral characteristics of their associated plasmonic resonances (wavelength, linewidth, extinction cross-section) and the electromagnetic coupling between satellites were observed using the spatial modulation spectroscopy technique and interpreted through a numerical model. The composite nano-objects exhibit numerous hot spots at satellite junctions, resulting in excellent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance. The SERS efficiency of the raspberry-like clusters is highly dependent on their structure.",

    "abstract": "As the incidence of obesity continues to increase, identifying novel nutritional therapies to enhance weight loss are needed. Raspberry ketone (RK; 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl) butan-2-one) is a bioactive phytochemical that is marketed as a weight loss supplement in the United States, yet there is scant scientific evidence demonstrating that RK promotes weight loss. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of RK on accumulation of adipose mass, hepatic lipid storage, and levels of plasma adiponectin in mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet. Mice were individually housed and fed a HF control diet (45% kcal from fat) for two weeks to induce weight gain, then assigned to HF control, high-dose (1.74% wt/wt) raspberry ketone (HRK), low-dose (0.25% wt/wt) raspberry ketone (LRK), or a pair-fed group (PF) fed similar food intake to LRK mice. Following five weeks of feeding, mice fed LRK and HRK diets showed reduced food intake and body weight compared to mice maintained on control diet. When normalized to body weight, mice fed HRK diet exhibited decreased inguinal fat mass and increased liver mass compared to the control group. Hepatic steatosis was lowest in mice fed HRK diet, whereas LRK diet did not have an effect when compared to the PF group. Plasma adiponectin concentration was unaffected by RK and pair-feeding. Our findings demonstrate that RK supplementation has limited benefit to adipose loss beyond reducing energy intake in mice fed a high-fat diet. The present study supports the need for appropriate study design when validating weight-loss supplements.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry fruit intake was investigated on obese diabetic (db/db) mice for 8weeks. Animals fed isocaloric diets (5.3% freeze-dried raspberry, or control) were assessed for obesity-diabetes-disease risk biomarkers. Results showed that raspberry intake improved antioxidant status and lessened plasma interleukin (IL)-6 (0.3-fold of control, p<0.1); most likely through enhancing glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in liver (4.3-fold of control), and in blood (2.1-fold of control). Other disease-risk biomarkers were similar between groups (p>0.05). Plasma levels of total cholesterol (T-CHL), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-CHL), and resistin were higher in the raspberry group. Overall, the enhanced detoxifying cell defenses exerted by raspberry intake might be due to its polyphenolics and fibre. This study demonstrates in vivo that raspberry intake, at a dose that can be achieved by human consumption, might protect against diabetes-induced oxidative stress.",

Two additional new metabolites, trienylfuranones A (2) and B (3), were isolated as minor components of the extract and their structure elucidation revealed that they were biosynthetically related to 1. Absolute stereochemical configurations of compounds 1-3 were confirmed by NOE NMR experiments and by the preparation of Mosher esters. Complete hydrogenation of 1 yielded tetrahydrofuran 7 that was used for stereochemical characterization and assessment of antifungal activity.",

RK has a structure closely related to 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanol (rhododendrol), a skin whitening agent that was found to cause leukoderma in the skin of consumers in 2013. Rhododendrol is a good substrate for tyrosinase and causes a tyrosinase-dependent cytotoxicity to melanocytes, cells that are responsible for skin pigmentation. Therefore, it is expected that RK exerts its cytotoxicity to melanocytes through the tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation to cytotoxic o-quinones. The results of this study demonstrate that the oxidation of RK by mushroom tyrosinase rapidly produces 4-(3-oxobutyl)-1,2-benzoquinone (RK-quinone), which is converted within 10-20 min to (E)-4-(3-oxo-1-butenyl)-1,2-benzoquinone (DBL-quinone). These quinones were identified as their corresponding catechols after reduction by ascorbic acid. RK-quinone and DBL-quinone quantitatively bind to the small thiol N-acetyl-l-cysteine to form thiol adducts and can also bind to the thiol protein bovine serum albumin through its cysteinyl residue. DBL-quinone is more reactive than RK-quinone, as judged by their half-lives (6.2 min vs 10.5 min, respectively), and decays rapidly to form an oligomeric pigment (RK-oligomer). The RK-oligomer can oxidize GSH to GSSG with a concomitant production of hydrogen peroxide, indicating its pro-oxidant activity, similar to that of the RD-oligomer. These results suggest that RK is cytotoxic to melanocytes through the binding of RK-derived quinones to thiol proteins and the pro-oxidant activity of the RK-oligomer.",

    "abstract": "\u03b2-cryptoxanthin (\u03b2-Cry), a xanthophyll, is unlike other abundant carotenoids, such as \u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin. It is not found in most fruits or vegetables but is found only in specific fruits, such as hot chili pepper, persimmon, and citrus fruits. Because recent reports suggest that \u03b2-Cry intake is beneficial to human health, the xanthophyll requires further investigation. Although \u03b2-Cry accumulates in the fruit of wild raspberry, Rubus palmatus, it is not present in cultivated raspberry. In the present study, two wild raspberry species were studied-R.\u00a0palmatus, which accumulates \u03b2-Cry in the fruit, and R.\u00a0crataegifolius, which does not accumulate \u03b2-Cry. Four carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes derived from these two species were analyzed-phytoene synthase (PSY), lycopene \u03b2-cyclase (LCYb), \u03b2-carotene hydroxylase (HYb), and zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP). Expression levels of their genes were also assessed to elucidate mechanism underlying \u03b2-Cry accumulation. Partial gene sequences of RubPSY, RubLCYb, RubHYb, and RubZEP, isolated from immature raspberry fruits of R.\u00a0palmatus, were used as probes for Northern blot analysis. RubZEP expression ceased as the fruits matured, possibly because of reduced production of zeaxanthin. \u03b2-Cry is considered to be an intermediate compound that accumulates in the mature fruits of R.\u00a0palmatus. High expression of RubPSY was detectable in the mature fruits of R.\u00a0crataegifolius, and the expression of RubLCYb, RubHYb, and RubZEP was detectable during all stages of fruit maturation. In contrast, \u03b2-Cry was absent in the mature fruits of R.\u00a0crataegifolius.",

    "abstract": "Functional proteins are very promising for protein therapeutics; however, effective delivery of therapeutic proteins remains challenging. Herein, we developed novel core/satellite nanoparticles by tethering therapeutic proteins to the core/shell polymeric particle surface through cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8])-mediated host-guest interactions. The effectiveness of the core/satellite nanoparticles as protein carrier was demonstrated through the intra-articular delivery of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). We showed that IL-1Ra can effectively self-assemble onto the surface of the polymeric nanoparticles and maintained good protein bioactivity by inhibiting IL-1-mediated signaling. More importantly, in vivo results revealed that IL-1Ra-bounded core/satellite nanoparticles could significantly increase the retention time of IL-1Ra in the rat stifle joint compared to soluble IL-1Ra, which could greatly improve the efficacy of IL-1Ra. These results indicate that the facile host-guest self-assembly can be exploited as an effective approach for realizing the therapeutic potential of proteins.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx comprise the sixth most common malignancies. Histologically, more than 90% of oral cancers are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Epidemiologic data strongly support the role of exogenous factors such as tobacco, alcohol, and human papilloma virus infection as major causative agents. Avoidance of risk factors has only been partially successful, and survival rates have not improved despite advances in therapeutic approaches. Therefore, new or improved approaches to prevention and/or early detection are critical. Better understanding of the mechanisms of oral carcinogenesis can assist in the development of novel biomarkers for early detection and strategies for disease prevention. Toward this goal, several animal models for carcinogenesis in the oral cavity have been developed. Among these are xenograft, and transgenic animal models, and others employing the synthetic carcinogens such as 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene in hamster cheek pouch and 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide in rats and mice. Additional animal models employing environmental carcinogens such as benzo[a]pyrene and N'-nitrosonornicotine have been reported. Each model has certain advantages and disadvantages. Models that (1) utilize environmental carcinogens, (2) reflect tumor heterogeneity, and (3) accurately represent the cellular and molecular changes involved in the initiation and progression of oral cancer in humans could provide a realistic platform. To achieve this goal, we introduced a novel nonsurgical mouse model to study oral carcinogenesis induced by dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DB[a,l]P), an environmental pollutant and tobacco smoke constituent, and its diol epoxide metabolite (\u00b1)-anti-11,12-dihydroxy-13,14-epoxy-11,12,13,14-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,l]pyrene [(\u00b1)-anti-DB[a,l]PDE]. On the basis of a detailed comparison of oral cancer induced by DB[a,l]P with that induced by the other above-mentioned oral carcinogens with respect to dose, duration, species and strain, cellular and molecular targets, and relative carcinogenic potency, our animal model may offer a more realistic platform to study oral carcinogenesis. In this perspective, we also discuss our preclinical studies to demonstrate the potential of black raspberry extracts on the prevention of OSCC. Specifically, we were the first to demonstrate that black raspberry inhibited DB[a,l]P-DNA binding and of particular importance its capacity to enhance the repair of DB[a,l]P-induced bulky lesions in DNA. We believe that the information presented in this perspective will stimulate further research on the impact of environmental carcinogens in the development of oral cancer and may lead to novel strategies toward the control and prevention of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species are tumorigenic by their ability to increase cell proliferation, survival, and cellular migration. The purpose of the present study was to compare the antioxidant activity and cytotoxic effects of 3 berry extracts (strawberry, Korean raspberry, and mulberry) in A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells. Except for raspberry, the ethyl acetate or methylene chloride fractions of berries containing phenolic compounds exerted dose dependent free radical scavenging activities. In the raspberry fractions, the hexane fraction also exhibited potent antioxidant activity. The cytotoxic effects of berries extracts in A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells were measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.

    "abstract": "The spotted wing drosophila (SWD), Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), is an invasive vinegar fly with a preference for infesting commercially viable berries and stone fruits. SWD infestations can reduce yields significantly, necessitating additional management activities. This analysis estimates economic losses in the California raspberry industry that have resulted from the SWD invasion.\nCalifornia raspberry producers experienced considerable revenue losses and management costs in the first years following SWD's invasion of North America. Conventional producers have since developed effective chemical management programs, virtually eliminating revenue losses due to SWD and reducing the cost of management to that of purchasing and applying insecticides more often. Organic raspberry producers, who do not have access to the same chemical controls, continue to confront substantial SWD-related revenue losses. These losses can be mitigated only by applying expensive insecticides registered for organic use and by performing labor-intensive field sanitation.\nSWD's invasion into North America has caused extensive crop losses to berry and cherry crops in California and elsewhere. Agricultural producers and researchers have responded quickly to this pest by developing management programs that significantly reduce revenue losses. Economic losses are expected to continue to fall as producers learn to manage SWD more efficiently and as new control tactics become available. \u00a9 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Conventional producers have since developed effective chemical management programs, virtually eliminating revenue losses due to SWD and reducing the cost of management to that of purchasing and applying insecticides more often. Organic raspberry producers, who do not have access to the same chemical controls, continue to confront substantial SWD-related revenue losses. These losses can be mitigated only by applying expensive insecticides registered for organic use and by performing labor-intensive field sanitation.",

    "abstract": "QTL mapping identifies a range of underlying and unrelated genes with apparent roles in raspberry fruit ripening and softening that show characteristic developing fruit expression profiles. Fruit softening is an important agronomical trait that involves a complex interaction of plant cell processes. We have used both qualitative and quantitative scoring of fruit firmness, length, mass, and resistance to applied force to identify QTL in a raspberry mapping population. QTLs were located primarily on linkage group (LG) 3 with other significant loci on LG 1 and LG 5 and showed mostly additive effects between the two parents. The expression of key genes that underlie these QTLs with roles in cell-wall solubility, water uptake, polyamine synthesis, transcription, and cell respiration was tested across five stages of fruit development, from immature green to red ripe fruit, using real-time RT-qPCR. Gene expression patterns showed variable expression patterns across fruit development with a highly significant positive and negative correlation between genes, supporting precise regulation of expression of different cell processes throughout raspberry fruit development. Variable timing in expression was also found in some genes at different fruit development stages between soft and firm cultivars. Multiple processes have a role to play in fruit softening and this will require development of multiple marker combinations to genes that characterise raspberry fruit softening.",

    "abstract": "A quantitative human norovirus (NoV) exposure model describing transmission of NoV during pre-harvest, harvest and further processing of soft red fruits exemplified by raspberries is presented. The outcomes of the model demonstrate the presence of NoV in raspberry puree or individual quick frozen (IQF) raspberry fruits and were generated by Monte Carlo simulations by combining GoldSim\u00ae and @Risk\u00ae software. Input data were collected from scientific literature, observational studies and assumptions. NoV contamination of soft red fruits is assumed to take place at farms by application of contaminated water for pesticides dilution or by berries' pickers shedding NoV. The model was built simulating that a collection center received berries from ten farms with a total of 245 food handlers picking soft red fruits during a 10-hour day shift. Given 0, 5 and 20 out of 245 berries' pickers were shedding NoV, these conditions were calculated to result in a mean NoV contamination of respectively 0.47, 14.1 and 36.2 NoV particles per kg raspberries in case all raspberries are mixed to one day-batch of 11tons. The NoV contamination of the fruits was mainly driven by the route of NoV shedding food pickers (95.8%) rather than by spraying contaminated pesticide water (4.2%) (baseline scenario with 5 shedding pickers and contaminated pesticide water). Inclusion of appropriate hand washing procedures or hand washing followed by hand disinfection resulted in estimated reductions of the mean NoV levels from 14.1 to 0.16 and 0.17 NoV particles per kg raspberries, respectively, for the baseline scenario with 5 out of 245 food pickers shedding NoV. The use of a mild heat treatment (30s at 75\u00b0C) during further processing of berries to purees was noted to reduce mean NoV levels substantially from 14.1 to 0.2 NoV particles per kg raspberry puree. For IQF raspberries, the NoV contamination is heterogeneously distributed and resulted in a mean contamination of 3.1 NoV particles per 250g package containing approximately 115 berries. This farm-to-fork model is a useful tool for evaluating NoV mitigation strategies in the soft red fruit supply chain.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic porous nanostructures consisting of oriented aggregates of iron oxide nanocrystals display very interesting properties such as a lower oxidation state of magnetite, and enhanced saturation magnetization in comparison with individual nanoparticles of similar sizes and porosity. However, the formation mechanism of these promising nanostructures is not well understood, which hampers the fine tuning of their magnetic properties, for instance by doping them with other elements. Therefore the formation mechanism of porous raspberry shaped nanostructures (RSNs) synthesized by a one-pot polyol solvothermal method has been investigated in detail from the early stages by using a wide panel of characterization techniques, and especially by performing original in situ HR-TEM studies in temperature. A time-resolved study showed the intermediate formation of an amorphous iron alkoxide phase with a plate-like lamellar structure (PLS). Then, the fine investigation of PLS transformation upon heating up to 500 \u00b0C confirmed that the synthesis of RSNs involves two iron precursors: the starting one (hydrated iron chlorides) and the in situ formed iron alkoxide precursor which decomposes with time and heating and contributes to the growth step of nanostructures. Such an understanding of the formation mechanism of RSNs is necessary to envision efficient and rational enhancement of their magnetic properties.",

    "abstract": "Automation of animal experimentation improves consistency, reduces potential for error while decreasing animal stress and increasing well-being. Radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging can identify individual mice in group housing environments enabling animal-specific tracking of physiological parameters.\nWe describe a simple protocol to radio frequency identification (RFID) tag and detect mice. RFID tags were injected sub-cutaneously after brief isoflurane anesthesia and do not require surgical steps such as suturing or incisions. We employ glass-encapsulated 125kHz tags that can be read within 30.2\u00b12.4mm of the antenna. A raspberry pi single board computer and tag reader enable automated logging and cross platform support is possible through Python.\nWe provide sample software written in Python to provide a flexible and cost effective system for logging the weights of multiple mice in relation to pre-defined targets.\nThe sample software can serve as the basis of any behavioral or physiological task where users will need to identify and track specific animals. Recently, we have applied this system of tagging to automated mouse brain imaging within home-cages.\nWe provide a cost effective solution employing open source software to facilitate adoption in applications such as automated imaging or tracking individual animal weights during tasks where food or water restriction is employed as motivation for a specific behavior.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) experiments are typically performed in controlled laboratory settings to minimise noise and produce reliable measurements. These controlled conditions also reduce the applicability of the obtained results to more varied environments and may limit their relevance to everyday situations.\nAdvances in computer portability may increase the mobility and applicability of EEG results while decreasing costs. In this experiment we show that stimulus presentation using a Raspberry Pi 2 computer provides a low cost, reliable alternative to a traditional desktop PC in the administration of EEG experimental tasks.\nSignificant and reliable MMN and P3 activity, typical event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with an auditory oddball paradigm, were measured while experiments were administered using the Raspberry Pi 2. While latency differences in ERP triggering were observed between systems, these differences reduced power only marginally, likely due to the reduced processing power of the Raspberry Pi 2.\nAn auditory oddball task administered using the Raspberry Pi 2 produced similar ERPs to those derived from a desktop PC in a laboratory setting. Despite temporal differences and slight increases in trials needed for similar statistical power, the Raspberry Pi 2 can be used to design and present auditory experiments comparable to a PC.\nOur results show that the Raspberry Pi 2 is a low cost alternative to the desktop PC when administering EEG experiments and, due to its small size and low power consumption, will enable mobile EEG experiments unconstrained by a traditional laboratory setting.",

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of risks of heart disease can be critical to fight cardiovascular diseases (CVD) associated with obesity and diabetes and for the implementation of nutritional interventions. The objective of this study was to investigate the cardioprotective effects of red raspberry consumption in the obese diabetic (db/db) mice using proteomic analysis as a tool. Hearts harvested from db/db mice fed an isocaloric diet (AIN-93G, control group) or AIN-93G supplemented with freeze-dried raspberry (raspberry group) for eight weeks were analyzed for changes in protein expression. Bioinformatics and pathway analysis of proteomic data detected in >50% samples were scrutinized with Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Histologic analysis, adipokines and lipid quantification in heart tissues were assessed as end points for disease biomarkers. Results from proteomic data identified five proteins unique to the control group involved in cardiac remodeling and one involved in stress response. Twenty-five proteins expressed in both groups were differentially downregulated in the raspberry group (p < 0.05) within 0.25-0.7-fold of control. Out of these, seven were involved in cardiac remodeling (e.g. natriuretic peptide precursor type A, 0.25-fold of control), and five were involved in stress response (e.g. glutathione S-transferase A4, 0.49-fold of control). However, no significant differences between raspberry and control groups were detected in heart lipid composition, adipokines, and morphology within the study timeframe. In conclusion, raspberry consumption may be effective in decreasing the levels of oxidative and inflammatory stress that promote morphological changes in the heart at an older age, thus preventing or delaying heart diseases.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry leaf is commonly consumed by pregnant women. Hypoglycemic effects have been documented with other species within the plant family. Whether raspberry leaf affects glycemic control in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is unknown.\nA 38-year-old nulliparous woman with GDM developed hypoglycemia requiring lowered insulin dose after consuming raspberry leaf tea at 32 weeks of gestation. The temporal relationship was confirmed by the patient's self-withdrawal and reintroduction of the herb. Fetal surveillance and growth were reassuring. A cesarean delivery was performed at 39 weeks of gestation. The neonate did not experience hypoglycemia or other complications. Placental biopsy revealed normal findings.\nConsumption of raspberry leaf may lead to reduced insulin requirements in GDM. Women with GDM should be cautioned about its use and their glucose levels more closely monitored.",

    "abstract": "Here, we report, for what we believe to be the first time, on the modification of a low cost sensor, designed for the smartphone camera market, to develop an ultraviolet (UV) camera system. This was achieved via adaptation of Raspberry Pi cameras, which are based on back-illuminated complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors, and we demonstrated the utility of these devices for applications at wavelengths as low as 310 nm, by remotely sensing power station smokestack emissions in this spectral region. Given the very low cost of these units, \u2248 USD 25, they are suitable for widespread proliferation in a variety of UV imaging applications, e.g., in atmospheric science, volcanology, forensics and surface smoothness measurements.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is an integral part of the neurodegeneration process inherent to several aging dysfunctions. Within the central nervous system, microglia are the effective immune cells, responsible for neuroinflammatory responses. In this study, raspberries were subjected to in vitro digestion simulation to obtain the components that result from the gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, which would be bioaccessible and available for blood uptake. Both the original raspberry extract and the gastrointestinal bioaccessible (GIB) fraction protected neuronal and microglia cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation, at low concentrations. Furthermore, this neuroprotective capacity was independent of intracellular ROS scavenging mechanisms. We show for the first time that raspberry metabolites present in the GIB fraction significantly inhibited microglial pro-inflammatory activation by LPS, through the inhibition of Iba1 expression, TNF-\u03b1 release and NO production. Altogether, this study reveals that raspberry polyphenols may present a dietary route to the retardation or amelioration of neurodegenerative-related dysfunctions.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical Au nanostructures have attracted considerable attention owing to their rich hot-spots in inherent structures that have found various applications in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based sensing and imaging. Herein we facilely synthesized uniform hierarchical raspberry-like Au nanostructures with tunable size via a seed-mediated growth approach employing a binary mixture of quaternized chitosan (QCS) and 5-bromosalicylic acid (5-BrSA). 5-BrSA plays an important role in tuning shapes and improving uniformity of resultant gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The obtained raspberry-like Au nanostructures have a spherical profile and randomly arranged protrusions on the outsides, and their size can be finely tuned in a range from 50 to 120 nm. The rough surfaces of the special raspberry-like Au nanostructures endow them higher SERS performance than spherical Au spheres with smooth surfaces, which is promising for the application of SERS based sensors and optical imaging.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents the chemical characteristics of ellagitannins isolated from raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) fruit and their in vitro and in situ antifungal activity against Geotrichum candidum \u0141OCK 0511. The study investigated a complex preparation containing various raspberry ellagitannins at a concentration of 86% w/w, as well as pure lambertianin C and sanguiin H-6. The ellagitannin preparation was obtained by extracting raspberry press cake and purifying the extract using Amberlite XAD resin, while individual compounds were isolated by means of preparative HPLC. The complex preparation was analyzed for the content of ellagitannins, anthocyanins, and flavan-3-ols using HPLC and LC-MS. The antifungal activity of the complex ellagitannin preparation and the isolated ellagitannins was determined for the strain Geotrichum candidum. The MIC and MFC values (10.0 mg/mL and 30.0 mg/mL, respectively) were found to be the same for lambertianin C, sanguiin H-6, and the complex ellagitannin preparation. The fungistatic activity of the studied ellagitannin preparation at a concentration of 10 mg/mL, as determined by the poisoned medium method, was 65.2% following 6 day incubation of Geotrichum candidum, with the linear growth rate of only 16.2 mm/day. The corresponding parameters for the control sample were 0% and 56 mm/day, respectively. The study demonstrated both in vitro and in situ antifungal activity of raspberry ellagitannins against Geotrichum candidum.",

    "abstract": "Influenza is a serious public health concern worldwide, as it causes significant morbidity and mortality. The emergence of drug-resistant viral strains requires new approaches for the treatment of influenza. In this study, Rubus coreanus seed (RCS) that is left over from the production of wine or juice was found to show antiviral activities against influenza type A and B viruses. Using the time-of-addition plaque assay, viral replication was almost completely abolished by simultaneous treatment with the RCS fraction of less than a 1-kDa molecular weight (RCSF1). One of the polyphenols derived from RCSF1, gallic acid (GA), identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, showed inhibitory effects against both influenza type A and B viruses, albeit at relatively high concentrations. RCSF1 was bound to hemagglutinin protein, inhibited hemagglutination significantly and disrupted viral particles, whereas GA was found to only disrupt the viral particles by using transmission electron microscopy. In BALB/c mice infected with influenza virus, oral administration of RCSF1 significantly improved the survival rate and reduced the viral titers in the lungs. Our results demonstrate that RCSF1 and GA show potent and broad antiviral activity against influenza A and B type viruses and are promising sources of agents that target virus particles.",

    "abstract": "Effects of black raspberry (BRB) extract and protocatechuic acid (PCA) on DNA adduct formation and mutagenesis induced by metabolites of dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DBP) were investigated in rat oral fibroblasts. The DBP metabolites, (\u00b1)-anti-11,12-dihydroxy-11,12,-dihydrodibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DBP-diol) and 11,12-dihydroxy-13,14-epoxy-11,12,13,14-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DBPDE) induced dose-dependent DNA adducts and mutations. DBPDE was considerably more potent, whereas the parent compound had no significant effect. Treatment with BRB extract (BRBE) and PCA resulted in reduced DBP-derived DNA adduct levels and reduced mutagenesis induced by DBP-diol, but only BRBE was similarly effective against (DBPDE). BRBE did not directly inactivate DBPDE, but rather induced a cellular response-enhanced DNA repair. When BRBE was added to cells 1 day after the DBP-diol, the BRBE greatly enhanced removal of DBP-derived DNA adducts. As oxidative stress can contribute to several stages of carcinogenesis, BRBE and PCA were investigated for their abilities to reduce oxidative stress in a human leukoplakia cell line by monitoring the redox indicator, 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF) in cellular and acellular systems. BRBE effectively inhibited the oxidation, but PCA was only minimally effective against H2DCF. These results taken together provide evidence that BRBE and PCA can inhibit initiation of carcinogenesis by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; and in addition, BRBE reduces oxidative stress.

    "abstract": "A fast and simple method for authenticating raspberry flavors from food products was developed. The two enantiomers of the compound (E)-\u03b1-ionone from raspberry flavor were separated on a chiral gas chromatographic column. Based on the ratio of these two enantiomers, the naturalness of a raspberry flavor can be evaluated due to the fact that a natural flavor will consist almost exclusively of the R enantiomer, while a chemical synthesis of the same compound will result in a racemic mixture. Twenty-seven food products containing raspberry flavors where investigated using SPME-chiral-GC-MS. We found raspberry jam, dried raspberries, and sodas declared to contain natural aroma all contained almost only R-(E)-\u03b1-ionone supporting the content of natural raspberry aroma. Six out of eight sweets tested did not indicate a content of natural aroma on the labeling which was in agreement with the almost equal distribution of the R and S isomer. Two products were labeled to contain natural raspberry flavors but were found to contain almost equal amounts of both enantiomers indicating a presence of synthetic raspberry flavors only. Additionally, two products that were labeled to contain both raspberry juice and flavor showed equal amounts of both enantiomers, indicating the presence of synthetic flavor.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we report a polymer-based raspberry-like micromotor. Interestingly, the resulting micromotor exhibits multistimuli-responsive motion behavior. Its on-off-on motion can be regulated by the application of stimuli such as H2O2, near-infrared light, NH3, or their combinations. Because of the versatility in motion control, the current micromotor has great potential in the application field of logic gate and logic circuit. With use of different stimuli as the inputs and the micromotor motion as the output, reprogrammable OR and INHIBIT logic gates or logic circuit consisting of OR, NOT, and AND logic gates can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) is an important specialty fruit crop in the US Pacific Northwest that can hybridize with the globally commercialized red raspberry (R.\u00a0idaeus). Here we report a 243\u00a0Mb draft genome of black raspberry that will serve as a useful reference for the Rosaceae and Rubus fruit crops (raspberry, blackberry, and their hybrids). The black raspberry genome is largely collinear to the diploid woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) with a conserved karyotype and few notable structural rearrangements. Centromeric satellite repeats are widely dispersed across the black raspberry genome, in contrast to the tight association with the centromere observed in most plants. Among the 28\u00a0005 predicted protein-coding genes, we identified 290 very recent small-scale gene duplicates enriched for sugar metabolism, fruit development, and anthocyanin related genes which may be related to key agronomic traits during black raspberry domestication. This contrasts patterns of recent duplications in the wild woodland strawberry F.\u00a0vesca, which show no patterns of enrichment, suggesting gene duplications contributed to domestication traits. Expression profiles from a fruit ripening series and roots exposed to Verticillium dahliae shed insight into fruit development and disease response, respectively. The resources presented here will expedite the development of improved black and red raspberry, blackberry and other Rubus cultivars.",

    "abstract": "The chemical characteristics of cold-pressed blackberry, black raspberry, and blueberry seed oils were evaluated for their fatty acid composition, positional distribution of fatty acids, triacylglycerol (TAG) profile, and minor component profile. The role of minor components, including tocols and pigments, on the oxidative stability was also investigated using high-temperature- and fluorescent-lighting-induced oxidation before and after tested berry seed oils were stripped of their minor components. The results indicated that all tested berry seed oils contained significant levels of palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2\u03c9-6), and \u03b1-linolenic (C18:3\u03c9-3) acids, along with a favorable ratio of \u03c9-6/\u03c9-3 fatty acids (1.49-3.86); palmitic, stearic, oleic, and \u03b1-linolenic acids were predominantly distributed on the terminal positions. Six TAGs, namely, LnLnLn, LnLLn, LLLn, LLL, OLL, and OLLn, were the major species detected in the tested berry seed oils. Total tocol contents were 286.3-1302.9 mg/kg, which include \u03b1-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-tocopherols as well as \u03b4-tocotrienol. Oxidative stability of the three berry seed oils was compromised after the removal of tocols under high-temperature-induced oxidation, while the loss of pigments (chlorophylls) led to weak oxidative stability when exposed to fluorescent lights.",

    "abstract": "The Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Q-fly), is a major horticultural pest in Eastern Australia. Effective monitoring, male annihilation technique (MAT) and mass trapping (MT) are all important for control and require strong lures to attract flies to traps or toxicants. Lure strength is thought to be related in part to volatility, but little vapour pressure data are available for most Q-fly lures. Raspberry ketone (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone) and analogs that had esters (acetyl, difluoroacetyl, trifluoroacetyl, formyl, propionyl) and ethers (methyl ether, trimethylsilyl ether) in replacement of the phenolic group, and in one case also had modification of the 2-butanone side chain, were measured for their vapour pressures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and their attractiveness to Q-fly was assessed in small cage environmentally controlled laboratory bioassays. Maximum response of one category of compounds, containing both 2-butanone side chain and ester group was found to be higher than that of the other group of compounds, of which either of 2-butanone or ester functionality was modified. However, linear relationship between vapour pressure and maximum response was not significant. The results of this study indicate that, while volatility may be a factor in lure effectiveness, molecular structure is the dominating factor for the series of molecules investigated.",

After 10\u00a0weeks, n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratios were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) lower in the livers and epididymal adipose tissues of the BRS 50\u00a0% and BRS 100\u00a0% mice than in the CON. Serum TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) lower in the BRS 50\u00a0% and BRS 100\u00a0% than in the CON. Serum IL-10 was significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) higher in the BRS 100\u00a0% than the CON. In the liver and epididymal adipose tissue, mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory markers in the BRS 50\u00a0% and BRS 100\u00a0% were lower than in the CON. Anti-inflammatory markers were higher in the epididymal adipose tissues of the BRS 50\u00a0% and BRS 100\u00a0% than in the CON. In the epididymal adipose tissue, macrophage infiltration markers (F4/80 and CD68) and leptin mRNA were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) lower in the BRS 50\u00a0% and BRS 100\u00a0% than in the CON. Results of this study suggest that BRS oil may have anti-inflammatory effects in obese diabetic mice by ameliorating inflammatory responses.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine bioactive components and radical scavenging capacity of black raspberry seed extracts as byproducts obtaining during the juice (FSE) and wine (WSE) making process. Cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside was identified as a major anthocyanin and the total anthocyanin contents of fresh and wine seed were 78.24 and 41.61\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g of dry weight, respectively. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents of FSE and WSE were 2.31\u00a0g gallic acid equivalent (GAE) and 360.95\u00a0mg catechin equivalent (CE), and 2.44\u00a0g GAE and 379.54\u00a0mg CE per 100\u00a0g dry weight, respectively. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values were 1041.9\u00a0\u03bcM TE/g for FSE and 1060.4\u00a0\u03bcM TE/g for WSE. Pretreatment of the FSE and WSE inhibited the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA and protein damage induced by hydroxyl radicals, and Fe(3+)/ascorbic acid-induced lipid peroxidation in a dose dependent manner. WSE more effectively protected from oxidative damage than FSE. Results from the current study suggest that black raspberry seeds as byproducts from juice and wine processing could be potential sources for natural antioxidants.",

    "abstract": "Successful valorisation of raspberry and blueberry pomace was achieved through their application, as dried and ground powders, in the formulation of value-added gluten-free cookies. Simplex-lattice mixture design approach was applied to obtain the product with the best sensory properties, nutritional profile and antioxidant activity. The highest desirability of 90.0\u00a0% was accomplished with the substitution of gluten-free flour mixture with 28.2\u00a0% of blueberry and 1.8\u00a0% of raspberry pomace. The model was verified. Optimized cookies had similar protein (3.72\u00a0%) and carbohydrate (66.7\u00a0%) contents as gluten-containing counterparts used for comparison, but significantly lower fat content (10.97\u00a0%). Daily portion of the optimized cookies meets: 5.00\u00a0% and 7.73\u00a0% of dietary reference intakes (DRIs) for linoleic acid, 23.6\u00a0% and 34.3\u00a0% of DRIs for \u03b1-linolenic acid and 10.3\u00a0% and 15.6\u00a0% of DRIs for dietary fibers, for male and female adults, respectively.

    "abstract": "Chronic intake of high sucrose (HS) diet exacerbates high-fat (HF) diet-induced obesity and its associated metabolic complications. Previously, we have demonstrated that ellagic acid (EA), an abundant polyphenol found in some fruits and nuts, exerts distinct lipid-lowering characteristics in hepatocytes and adipocytes. In this study, we hypothesized that EA supplementation inhibits HS diet-mediated hepatic toxicity and its accompanied metabolic dysregulation. To test this hypothesis, C57BL/6 male mice were randomly assigned to three isocaloric HF diets (41% calories from fat) containing either no-sucrose (HF), high-sucrose (HFHS), or high-sucrose plus EA (HFHS-R) from raspberry seed flour (RSF, equivalent to 0.03% of EA), and fed for 12weeks. The inclusion of EA from RSF significantly improved HFHS diet-mediated dyslipidemia and restored glucose homeostasis levels similar to the HF diet-fed mice. Despite marginal difference in hepatic triglyceride content, the addition of EA substantially reversed the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative damage triggered by HFHS diet in the liver. These effects of EA were further confirmed in human hepatoma cells by reducing ER stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, HFHS-R diet significantly decreased visceral adipocyte hypertrophy and adipose tissue inflammation evidenced by reduced proinflammatory gene expression and macrophage infiltration. In summary, EA supplementation from RSF was effective in reducing HFHS diet-mediated metabolic complication by attenuating hepatic ER and oxidative stresses as well as adipocyte inflammation. Our results suggest that the inclusion of EA in diets may normalize metabolic insults triggered by HS consumption.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic-assisted extraction was employed for highly efficient separation of aroma oil from raspberry seeds. A central composite design with two variables and five levels was employed and effects of process variables of sonication time and extraction temperature on oil recovery and quality were investigated. Optimal conditions predicted by response surface methodology were sonication time of 37 min and extraction temperature of 54\u00b0C. Specifically, ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) was able to provide a higher content of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids, whereas conventional Soxhlet extraction (SE) resulted in a higher amount of saturated fatty acids. Moreover, raspberry seed oil contained abundant amounts of edible linoleic acid and linolenic acid, which suggest raspberry seeds could be valuable edible sources of natural \u03b3-linolenic acid products. In comparison with SE, UAE exerted higher free radical scavenging capacities. In addition, UAE significantly blocked H2O2-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the effects on quality of incorporating raspberry and cranberry pomaces into American-style muffins prepared under various baking conditions. The different baking conditions did not affect the texture or microstructure of the control muffins. The enhanced samples baked at 140\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min were characterized by a harder texture than the control muffins and by a distributed protein matrix and distorted starch granules, while those baked at 240\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min had a moist texture and showed incomplete starch gelatinization. The mean percent recovery of ellagic acid, flavonols, tocopherols, tocotrienols, and anthocyanins after baking were 156, 53, 48, 43, and 22\u00a0%, respectively. Lower baking temperature was better for ellagic acid and tocotrienols, but worse for flavonols, tocopherols, and anthocyanins. It seems that, for the enhanced samples, the intermediate baking conditions (180\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min) guarantee the best microstructure and texture and the appropriate retention of phytochemicals in muffins.",

    "abstract": "The fabrication, characterisation and controlled cargo release of hollow mesoporous raspberry-like colloids (HMRCs), which are assembled by utilising host-guest complexation of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) are described. CB[8] is employed as a supramolecular linker to 'stick' the viologen functionalised paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles onto an azobenzene functionalised hollow mesoporous silica core. The formed HMRCs are photoresponsive and can be reversibly disassembled upon light irradiation, endowing them with an ability to release loaded cargo under photocontrol. While the assembled HMRCs retain cargo inside their cavity, disassembled particles with their iron oxide nanoparticle 'caps' removed will release the loaded cargo through the mesoporous shell of the hollow silica colloids. A model system using a boronic acid derivative as the cargo in the HMRCs and Alizarin Red salt as a sensor for the released boronic acid is demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "A high concentration of histamine, one of the biogenic amines (BAs) usually found in fermented foods, can cause undesirable physiological side effects in sensitive humans. The objective of this study is to isolate indigenous Acetobacter strains from naturally fermented Bokbunja vinegar in Korea with reduced histamine production during starter fermentation. Further, we examined its physiological and biochemical properties, including BA synthesis. The obtained strain MBA-77, identified as Acetobacter aceti by 16S rDNA homology and biochemical analysis and named A. aceti MBA-77. A. aceti MBA-77 showed optimal acidity % production at pH 5; the optimal temperature was 25\u00b0C. When we prepared and examined the BAs synthesis spectrum during the fermentation process, Bokbunja wine fermented with Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that the histamine concentration increased from 2.72 of Bokbunja extract to 5.29mg/L and cadaverine and dopamine was decreased to 2.6 and 10.12mg/L, respectively. Bokbunja vinegar prepared by A. aceti MBA-77 as the starter, the histamine concentration of the vinegar preparation step was decreased up to 3.66mg/L from 5.29mg/L in the wine preparation step. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate acetic acid bacteria isolated from Bokbunja seed vinegar with low spectrum BA and would be useful for wellbeing vinegar preparation.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberry seeds, a byproduct of wine and juice production, contain large quantities of polyphenolic compounds. The antiviral effects of black raspberry seed extract (RCS) and its fraction with molecular weight less than 1\u00a0kDa (RCS-F1) were examined against food-borne viral surrogates, murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1) and feline calicivirus-F9 (FCV-F9). The maximal antiviral effect was achieved when RCS or RCS-F1 was added simultaneously to cells with MNV-1 or FCV-F9, reaching complete inhibition at 0.1-1\u00a0mg/mL. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed enlarged viral capsids or disruption (from 35\u00a0nm to up to 100\u00a0nm) by RCS-F1. Our results thus suggest that RCS-F1 can interfere with the attachment of viral surface protein to host cells. Further, two polyphenolic compounds derived from RCS-F1, cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) and gallic acid, identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, showed inhibitory effects against the viruses. C3G was suggested to bind to MNV-1 RNA polymerase and to enlarge viral capsids using differential scanning fluorimetry and TEM, respectively.",

    "abstract": "We present a bottom-up assembly route for a large-scale organization of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) into three-dimensional (3D) modular assemblies with core/satellite structure. The protein-assisted assembly of small spherical gold or silver NPs with a hydrophilic protein shell (as satellites) onto larger metal NPs (as cores) offers high modularity in sizes and composition at high satellite coverage (close to the jamming limit). The resulting dispersions of metal/metal nanoclusters exhibit high colloidal stability and therefore allow for high concentrations and a precise characterization of the nanocluster architecture in dispersion by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Strong near-field coupling between the building blocks results in distinct regimes of dominant satellite-to-satellite and core-to-satellite coupling. High robustness against satellite disorder was proved by UV/vis diffuse reflectance (integrating sphere) measurements. Generalized multiparticle Mie theory (GMMT) simulations were employed to describe the electromagnetic coupling within the nanoclusters. The close correlation of structure and optical property allows for the rational design of core/satellite nanoclusters with tailored plasmonics and well-defined near-field enhancement, with perspectives for applications such as surface-enhanced spectroscopies.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone is the primary aroma compound found in raspberries and naturally derived raspberry ketone is a valuable flavoring agent. The economic incentives for the production of raspberry ketone, combined with the very poor yields from plant tissue, therefore make this compound an excellent target for heterologous production in synthetically engineered microbial strains.\nA de novo pathway for the production of raspberry ketone was assembled using four heterologous genes, encoding phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxlase, coumarate-CoA ligase and benzalacetone synthase, in an industrial strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthetic protein fusions were also explored as a means of increasing yields of the final product.\nThe highest raspberry ketone concentration achieved in minimal media exceeded 7.5 mg/L when strains were fed with 3 mM p-coumaric acid; or 2.8 mg/L for complete de novo synthesis, both of which utilized a coumarate-CoA ligase, benzalacetone synthase synthetic fusion protein that increased yields over fivefold compared to the native enzymes. In addition, this strain was shown to be able to produce significant amounts of raspberry ketone in wine, with a raspberry ketone titer of 3.5 mg/L achieved after aerobic fermentation of Chardonnay juice or 0.68 mg/L under anaerobic winemaking conditions.\nWe have shown that it is possible to produce sensorially-relevant quantities of raspberry ketone in an industrial heterologous host. This paves the way for further pathway optimization to provide an economical alternative to raspberry ketone derived from plant sources.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila is an extremely useful model organism for understanding how innate immune mechanisms defend against microbes and parasitoids. Large foreign objects trigger a potent cellular immune response in Drosophila larva. In the case of endoparasitoid wasp eggs, this response includes hemocyte proliferation, lamellocyte differentiation and eventual encapsulation of the egg. The encapsulation reaction involves the attachment and spreading of hemocytes around the egg, which requires cytoskeletal rearrangements, changes in adhesion properties and cell shape, as well as melanization of the capsule. Guanine nucleotide metabolism has an essential role in the regulation of pathways necessary for this encapsulation response. Here, we show that the Drosophila inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), encoded by raspberry (ras), is centrally important for a proper cellular immune response against eggs from the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. Notably, hemocyte attachment to the egg and subsequent melanization of the capsule are deficient in hypomorphic ras mutant larvae, which results in a compromised cellular immune response and increased survival of the parasitoid.",

    "abstract": "Superhydrophobic particulate films were fabricated via deposition of raspberry-like fluorescent PS/CdTe/silica microspheres on clean glass substrates and surface modification. Particularly, the fluorescent microspheres were prepared by a kind of modified strategy, namely introducing poly (acrylic acid)-functionalized polystyrene microspheres and thiol-stabilized CdTe quantum dots into a hydrolysis reaction of tetraethoxysilane simultaneously. And through adjusting the reaction parameters, the polystyrene spheres with two particle sizes and three colors of CdTe quantum dots aqueous solution were obtained. Consequently, raspberry-like microspheres consist of polystyrene cores and the composite shells of CdTe quantum dots and silica. These microspheres possess a fluorescent characteristic and form a hierarchical dual roughness which was conductive to superhydrophobicity, and the hydrophobic tests also showed the contact angles of water droplets on the surface of the raspberry-like microspheres which were over 160\u00b0 at room temperature.",

Lures that attract male Q-fly are important for detection of incursions and outbreaks, monitoring of populations, and control by mass trapping and male annihilation. Cuelure, an analog of naturally occurring raspberry ketone, is the standard Q-fly lure, but it has limited efficacy compared with lures that are available for some other fruit flies such as methyl eugenol for B. dorsalis. Melolure is a more recently developed raspberry ketone analog that has shown better attraction than cuelure in some field studies but not in others. A novel fluorinated analog of raspberry ketone, raspberry ketone trifluoroacetate (RKTA), has been developed as a potential improvement on cuelure and melolure. RKTA placed on laboratory cages containing 2-week-old Q-flies elicited strong behavioral responses from males. Quantification of Q-fly responses in these cages, using digital images to estimate numbers of flies aggregated near different lures, showed RKTA attracted and arrested significantly more flies than did cuelure or melolure. RKTA shows good potential as a new lure for improved surveillance and control of Q-fly.",

    "abstract": "Surface-imprinted microspheres were controllably synthesized using ionic liquid-functionalized microspheres with a highly cross-linked raspberry-like structure as the matrix via surface molecular self-assembly and precipitation polymerization in aqueous media at room temperature. An immunostimulating hexapeptide from human (IHH) with medical properties was chosen as a template molecule in the preparation of different molecularly imprinted microspheres (MIMs). The experiment process was tracked and the as-prepared microspheres were well characterized. Results reveal that the adsorption capacity and selective recognition of MIMs have a direct relationship with the properties of the functional chain of the ionic liquid-functionalized microspheres. Moreover, MIMs that have both high adsorption capacity and good selective recognition were used in competitive rebinding tests and analysis of urine samples, which demonstrated their potential use for IHH enrichment and in real samples.",

    "abstract": "Administration of black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) is known to improve vascular endothelial function in patients at a high risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease. We investigated short-term effects of black raspberry on circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and arterial stiffness in patients with metabolic syndrome. Patients with metabolic syndrome (n\u2009=\u200951) were prospectively randomized into the black raspberry group (n\u2009=\u200926, 750\u2009mg/day) and placebo group (n\u2009=\u200925) during the 12-week follow-up. Central blood pressure, augmentation index, and EPCs, such as CD34/KDR(+), CD34/CD117(+), and CD34/CD133(+), were measured at baseline and at 12-week follow-up. Radial augmentation indexes were significantly decreased in the black raspberry group compared to the placebo group (-5%\u2009\u00b1\u200910% vs. 3%\u2009\u00b1\u200914%, P\u2009<\u2009.05). CD34/CD133(+) cells at 12-week follow-up were significantly higher in the black raspberry group compared to the placebo group (19\u2009\u00b1\u2009109/\u03bcL vs. -28\u2009\u00b1\u200957/\u03bcL, P\u2009<\u2009.05). Decreases from the baseline in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were significantly greater in the black raspberry group compared to the placebo group (-0.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u2009pg/mL vs. -0.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u2009pg/mL, P\u2009<\u2009.05 and -5.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5\u2009pg/mL vs. -0.8\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0\u2009pg/mL, P\u2009<\u2009.05, respectively). Increases from the baseline in adiponectin levels (2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u2009\u03bcg/mL vs. -0.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL, P\u2009<\u2009.05) were significant in the black raspberry group. The use of black raspberry significantly lowered the augmentation index and increased circulating EPCs, thereby improving CV risks in patients with metabolic syndrome during the 12-week follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Ellagic acid/ellagitannins are plant polyphenolic antioxidants that are synthesized from gallic acid and have been associated with a reduced risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Here, we report the identification and characterization of five glycosyltransferases (GTs) from two genera of the Rosaceae family (Fragaria and Rubus; F. \u00d7 ananassa FaGT2*, FaGT2, FaGT5, F. vesca FvGT2, and R. idaeus RiGT2) that catalyze the formation of 1-O-galloyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranose (\u03b2-glucogallin) the precursor of ellagitannin biosynthesis. The enzymes showed substrate promiscuity as they formed glucose esters of a variety of (hydroxyl)benzoic and (hydroxyl)cinnamic acids. Determination of kinetic values and site-directed mutagenesis revealed amino acids that affected substrate preference and catalytic activity. Green immature strawberry fruits were identified as the main source of gallic acid, \u03b2-glucogallin, and ellagic acid in accordance with the highest GT2 gene expression levels. Injection of isotopically labeled gallic acid into green fruits of stable transgenic antisense FaGT2 strawberry plants clearly confirmed the in planta function. Our results indicate that GT2 enzymes might contribute to the production of ellagic acid/ellagitannins in strawberry and raspberry, and are useful to develop strawberry fruit with additional health benefits and for the biotechnological production of bioactive polyphenols.",

    "abstract": "Rhododenol or rhododendrol (RD, 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanol) occurs naturally in many plants along with raspberry ketone (RK, 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone), a ketone derivative, which include Nikko maple tree (Acer nikoense) and white birch (Betula platyphylla). De-pigmenting activity of RD was discovered and it was used as a brightening ingredient for the skin whitening cosmetics. Recently, cosmetics containing RD were withdrawn from the market because a number of consumers developed leukoderma, inflammation and erythema on their face, neck and hands. Here, we explored the mechanism underlying the toxicity of RD and RK against melanocytes using B16F10 murine melanoma cells and human primary epidermal melanocytes. Treatment with RD or RK resulted in the decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner which appeared from cell growth arrest. Consistently, ROS generation was significantly increased by RD or RK as determined by DCF-enhanced fluorescence. An antioxidant enzyme, glutathione peroxidase was depleted as well. In line with ROS generation, oxidative damages and the arrest of normal cell proliferation, GADD genes (Growth Arrest and DNA Damage) that include GADD45 and GADD153, were significantly up-regulated. Prevention of ROS generation with an anti-oxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly rescued RD and RK-suppressed melanocyte proliferation. Consistently, up-regulation of GADD45 and GADD153 was significantly attenuated by NAC, suggesting that increased ROS and the resultant growth arrest of melanocytes may contribute to RD and RK-induced leukoderma.",

    "abstract": "Ethyl carbamate (EC), a probable human carcinogen, occurs widely in many fermented foods. Previous studies indicated that EC-induced cytotoxicity was associated with oxidative stress. Wild raspberries are rich in polyphenolic compounds, which possess potent antioxidant activity. This study was conducted to investigate the protective effect of wild raspberry extracts produced before (RE) and after in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion (RD) on EC-induced oxidative damage in Caco-2 cells. Our primary data showed that ethyl carbamate could result in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in Caco-2 cells and raspberry extract after digestion (RD) may be more effective than that before digestion (RE) in attenuating toxicity caused by ethyl carbamate. Further investigation by fluorescence microscope revealed that RD may significantly ameliorate EC-induced oxidative damage by scavenging the overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), maintaining mitochondrial function and preventing glutathione (GSH) depletion. In addition, HPLC-ESI-MS results showed that the contents of identified polyphenolic compounds (esculin, kaempferol O-hexoside, and pelargonidin O-hexoside) were remarkably increased after digestion, which might be related to the better protective effect of RD. Overall, our results demonstrated that raspberry extract undergoing simulated gastrointestinal digestion may improve the protective effect against EC-induced oxidative damage in Caco-2 cells.",

    "abstract": "Antioxidants contained in plant raw materials prevent oxidative stress, and reduce the degenerative effects of free radical reactions and damage caused by UV radiation. Antioxidant activity is exhibited, for example, in raspberry (Rubus idaeus), and blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), which have a high content of tannins, flavonoids, phenolic acids, vitamins and minerals.\nThe raw plant material consisted of fresh and dried leaves and fruits of raspberries and blackberries harvested in 2014. This material was extracted using a Soxhlet apparatus and by an ultrasound-assisted technique. To evaluate antioxidant activity DPPH and FRAP methods were used in the first year and DPPH and ABTS methods in the second year of the study.\nThe highest antioxidant activity, evaluated by the DPPH method in 2015, was demonstrated by both raspberry and blackberry fresh leaf extracts, whereas the highest reductive ability, assessed by FRAP, was demonstrated in fresh and dried blackberry leaves. In the next year of the study (2016), the activity of samples evaluated using the DPPH method did not differ significantly, with the exception of fresh raspberry leaf. In this year, the highest antioxidant properties, assessed using the ABTS method, were shown by extracts made of fresh blackberry leaves and fruits, and dried blackberry leaves.\nAll the studied material, both ethanolic leaves and fruit extracts of raspberry and blackberry, reduced free radicals, which was examined using three methods of evaluation of the antioxidative properties (DPPH, FRAP and ABTS). The storage of ethanolic extracts at ambient temperature had no significant impact on the activity reduction of the evaluated plant material. The antioxidant activity of most examined extracts remained consistently high, which may be reflected in the use of the studied materials as sources of antioxidants in the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industries.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberries (BRB) demonstrate potent inhibition of aerodigestive tract carcinogenesis in animal models. However, translational clinical trials evaluating the ability of BRB phytochemicals to impact molecular biomarkers in the oral mucosa remain limited. The present phase 0 study addresses a fundamental question for oral cancer food-based prevention: Do BRB phytochemicals successfully reach the targeted oral tissues and reduce proinflammatory and antiapoptotic gene expression profiles? Patients with biopsy-confirmed oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) administered oral troches containing freeze-dried BRB powder from the time of enrollment to the date of curative intent surgery (13.9 \u00b1 1.27 days). Transcriptional biomarkers were evaluated in patient-matched OSCCs and noninvolved high at-risk mucosa (HARM) for BRB-associated changes. Significant expression differences between baseline OSCC and HARM tissues were confirmed using a panel of genes commonly deregulated during oral carcinogenesis. Following BRB troche administration, the expression of prosurvival genes (AURKA, BIRC5, EGFR) and proinflammatory genes (NFKB1, PTGS2) were significantly reduced. There were no BRB-associated grade 3-4 toxicities or adverse events, and 79.2% (N = 30) of patients successfully completed the study with high levels of compliance (97.2%). The BRB phytochemicals cyanidin-3-rutinoside and cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside were detected in all OSCC tissues analyzed, demonstrating that bioactive components were successfully reaching targeted OSCC tissues. We confirmed that hallmark antiapoptotic and proinflammatory molecular biomarkers were overexpressed in OSCCs and that their gene expression was significantly reduced following BRB troche administration. As these molecular biomarkers are fundamental to oral carcinogenesis and are modifiable, they may represent emerging biomarkers of molecular efficacy for BRB-mediated oral cancer chemoprevention.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry is well known as rich source of antioxidants, such as polyphenols and flavonoids. However, after consumption, the antioxidants are subjected to digestive conditions within the gastrointestinal tract that may result in structural and functional alterations. Our previous study indicated that acrylamide (AA)-induced cytotoxicity was associated with oxidative stress. However, the protective effect of wild raspberry extract produced before and after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion against AA-induced oxidative damage is unclear. In the present study, we found that wild raspberry extract produced after digestion (RD) had a pronounced protective effect against AA-induced cytotoxicity compared with that produced before digestion (RE). Further investigation indicated that RD significantly inhibited AA-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse and glutathione (GSH) depletion. Moreover, LC-MS analysis revealed that wild raspberry underwent gastrointestinal digestion significantly increased the contents of esculin, kaempferol hexoside and pelargonidin hexoside.",

    "abstract": "Polyphenols are a class of natural compounds whose potential as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenesis has been reported in many pathological conditions. Red raspberry extract, rich in polyphenols, has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects and prevent cell proliferation in distinct animal models. However, the signaling pathways involved remain unknown. Herein, we used human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) to determine the influence of red raspberry phenolic compound extract concentrations, ranging from 10 to 250\u2009\u00b5g gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/mL, on endothelium viability (MTS assay), proliferation (BrdU incorporation), migration (injury assay), and capillary-like structures formation (Matrigel assay). Protein expression in cell lysates was determined by Western blot analysis. We showed that red raspberry extracts reduced cell viability (GI50 \u2009=\u200987,64\u2009\u00b1\u20096,59\u2009\u03bcg GAE/mL) and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. A significant abrogation of cells ability to migrate to injured areas, even at low concentrations, was observed by injury assay. Cell assembly into capillary-like structures on Matrigel also decreased in a dose dependent-manner for higher extract concentrations, as well as the number of branching points per unit of area. Protein expression analysis showed a dose-dependent decrease in Phospho-VEGFR2 expression, implying abrogation of VEGF signaling activity. We also showed for the first time that red raspberry phenolic compounds induce the rearrangement of filamentous actin cytoskeleton, with an isotropy increase found for higher testing concentrations. Taken together, our findings corroborate the anti-angiogenic potential of red raspberry phenolic compounds and provide new insights into their mode of action upon endothelium. J. Cell.

    "abstract": "The Chilean raspberry Rubus geoides Sm. (Rosaceae) is a native species occurring in the Patagonia. Five R. geoides samples were assessed for phenolic content and composition, antioxidant activity, effect on total reduced glutathione (GSH) synthesis and protective effect against H2O2 and methylglyoxal (MGO)-induced stress in epithelial gastric AGS cells. The HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS profiles allowed the tentative identification of 39 phenolics including flavonol glycosides and tannins. R. geoides presented higher total phenolic and flavonoid content than Rubus idaeus. Two out of the five phenolic enriched R. geoides extracts (PEEs) exhibited better antioxidant activity than R. idaeus in the DPPH, FRAP and TEAC assays. A significant cytoprotective activity was observed when AGS cells were pre-incubated with extracts and subsequently challenged with H2O2 or MGO. Treatment with the PEEs increased the intracellular GSH content. R. geoides fruit extracts may induce the activation of intracellular protection mechanisms against oxidative and dicarbonyl-induced stress.",

    "abstract": "The raspberry, Rubus idaeus L., provides several plant parts (as buds) used for food supplements. The aim of this research was to establish a technique for chemical composition control of R. idaeus herbal preparations, using chromatographic methods. These methods allowed us to identify and quantify the main phytochemicals, obtaining a specific phytochemical fingerprint (phytocomplex). Combined with two different chemometric methods\u00a0-\u00a0clustering analysis and principal component analysis\u00a0-\u00a0the raspberry bud extracts of the different cultivars were efficiently characterized.\nRubus idaeus buds were identified as a rich source of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds: organic acids, vitamins and catechins were found to be the most discriminating variables by chemometric techniques to differentiate raspberry cultivars. In particular, catechins (13.25%) and flavonols (8.71%) were the most important polyphenolic classes, followed by cinnamic and benzoic acids.\nThis study developed a useful tool for R. idaeus extract phytochemical characterization that could be applied also for differentiation and composition control of other herbal preparations. \u00a9 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "abstract": "Numerous medications are used to treat hyperpigmentation. However, several reports have indicated that repeated application of some agents, such as rhododendrol (RD), raspberry ketone (RK) and monobenzone (MB), can be toxic to melanocytes. Although these agents had severe side effects in human trials, no current in vitro methods can predict the safety of such drugs. This study assessed the in vitro effects of five depigmentary compounds including leukoderma-inducing agents. In particular, we determined the effects of different concentrations and exposure times of different depigmentary agents on cell viability and melanogenesis in the presence and absence of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. Concentrations of RD, RK and MB that inhibit melanogenesis are similar to concentrations that are cytotoxic; however, concentrations of rucinol (RC) and AP736 that inhibit melanogenesis are much lower than concentrations that are cytotoxic. Furthermore, the concentrations that cause toxic effects depend on exposure duration, and prolonged exposure to RD, RK and MB had more cytotoxic effects than prolonged exposure to RC and AP736. The cytotoxic effects of RD and RK appear to be mediated by apoptosis due to increased expression of caspase-3 and caspase-8; UVB radiation increased the cytotoxicity of these agents and also increased caspase activity. Our results indicate that different leukoderma-inducing compounds have different effects on the viability of normal epidermal melanocytes and suggest that the in vitro assay used here can be used to predict whether an investigational compound that induces leukoderma may lead to adverse effects in human trials.",

    "abstract": "Dehydration has been considered as one of the traditional but most effective techniques for perishable fruits. Raspberry powders obtained after dehydration can be added as ingredients into food formulations such as bakery and dairy products. In this study, raspberry powders obtained by hot air drying (HAD), infrared radiation drying (IRD), hot air and explosion puffing drying (HA-EPD), infrared radiation and microwave vacuum drying (IR-MVD) and freeze drying (FD) were compared on physical properties, bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity.\nDrying techniques affected the physical properties, bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of raspberry powders greatly. FD led to significantly higher (P < 0.05) values of water solubility (45.26%), soluble solid (63.46%), hygroscopicity (18.06%), color parameters and anthocyanin retention (60.70%) of raspberry powder compared with other drying methods. However, thermal drying techniques, especially combined drying methods, were superior to FD in final total polyphenol content, total flavonoid content and antioxidant activity. The combined drying methods, especially IR-MVD, showed the highest total polyphenol content (123.22 g GAE kg(-1) dw) and total flavonoid content (0.30 g CAE kg(-1) dw). Additionally, IR-MVD performed better in antioxidant activity retention.\nOverall, combined drying methods, especially IR-MVD, were found to result in better quality of raspberry powders among the thermal drying techniques. IR-MVD could be recommended for use in the drying industry because of its advantages in time saving and nutrient retention.",
