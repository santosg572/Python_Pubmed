    "abstract": "The lack of inter-method agreement can produce inconsistent results in neuroimaging studies. We evaluated the intra-method repeatability and the inter-method reproducibility of two widely-used automatic segmentation methods for brain MRI: the FreeSurfer (FS) and the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software packages.\nWe segmented the gray matter (GM), the white matter (WM) and subcortical structures in test-retest MRI data of healthy volunteers from Kirby-21 and OASIS datasets. We used Pearson's correlation (r), Bland-Altman plot and Dice index to study intra-method repeatability and inter-method reproducibility. In order to test whether different processing methods affect the results of a neuroimaging-based group study, we carried out a statistical comparison between male and female volume measures.\nA high correlation was found between test-retest volume measures for both SPM (r in the 0.98-0.99 range) and FS (r in the 0.95-0.99 range). A non-null bias between test-retest FS volumes was detected for GM and WM in the OASIS dataset. The inter-method reproducibility analysis measured volume correlation values in the 0.72-0.98 range and the overlap between the segmented structures assessed by the Dice index was in the 0.76-0.83 range. SPM systematically provided significantly greater GM volumes and lower WM and subcortical volumes with respect to FS. In the male vs. female brain volume comparisons, inconsistencies arose for the OASIS dataset, where the gender-related differences appear subtler with respect to the Kirby dataset.\nThe inter-method reproducibility should be evaluated before interpreting the results of neuroimaging studies.",

    "abstract": "Ratios between opposing volumes from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide additional information to volumes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain three-dimensional MPRAGE MRI at 3T were segmented into 44 regions using FreeSurfer v6 in 75 participants. The region's size in absolute volumes and relative proportions to the whole brain volume were compared between 39 AD patients and 36 age-, education- and sex-matched normal controls (NC). Volumes of the most atrophied parts were related to the opposing volumes of the most enlarged parts as ratios. The most atrophic structures in AD were both hippocampi. By contrast, the greatest enlargements in AD were inferior parts of both lateral ventricles. The best ratio for each side was the hippocampo-horn proportion calculated as ratio: the hippocampus / (the hippocampus\u202f+\u202finferior lateral ventricle). Its optimal cut-off of 74% yielded sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 78% on the left and sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 78% on the right. The hippocampo-horn proportion is another measure to evaluate the degree of hippocampal atrophy on brain MRI in percentages. It has a potential to be simplified into a comparison of two-dimensional corresponding areas or a visual assessment.",

    "abstract": "Performing quality control to detect image artifacts and data-processing errors is crucial in structural magnetic resonance imaging, especially in developmental studies. Currently, many studies rely on visual inspection by trained raters for quality control. The subjectivity of these manual procedures lessens comparability between studies, and with growing study sizes quality control is increasingly time consuming. In addition, both inter-rater as well as intra-rater variability of manual quality control is high and may lead to inclusion of poor quality scans and exclusion of scans of usable quality. In the current study we present the Qoala-T tool, which is an easy and free to use supervised-learning model to reduce rater bias and misclassification in manual quality control procedures using FreeSurfer-processed scans. First, we manually rated quality of N\u202f=\u202f784 FreeSurfer-processed T1-weighted scans acquired in three different waves in a longitudinal study. Different supervised-learning models were then compared to predict manual quality ratings using FreeSurfer segmented output data. Results show that the Qoala-T tool using random forests is able to predict scan quality with both high sensitivity and specificity (mean area under the curve (AUC)\u202f=\u202f0.98). In addition, the Qoala-T tool was also able to adequately predict the quality of two novel unseen datasets (total N\u202f=\u202f872). Finally, analyses of age effects showed that younger participants were more likely to have lower scan quality, underlining that scan quality might confound findings attributed to age effects. These outcomes indicate that this procedure could further help to reduce variability related to manual quality control, thereby benefiting the comparability of data quality between studies.",

    "abstract": "To compare the cross-sectional robustness of commonly used volumetric software and effects of lesion filling in multiple sclerosis (MS).\nNine MS patients (six females; age 38\u00b113 years, disease duration 7.3\u00b15.2 years) were scanned twice with repositioning on three MRI scanners (Siemens Aera 1.5T, Avanto 1.5T, Trio 3.0T) the same day. Volumetric T\nVariability in volumetrics was lower within than between scanners (CoV 0.17-0.96% vs. 0.65-5.0%, p<0.001). All software provided similarly robust segmentations of the brain volume on the same scanner (CoV 0.17-0.28%, p=0.076). Normalisation improved inter-scanner reproducibility in FreeSurfer and SPM-based methods, but the FSL-SIENAX scaling factor did not improve robustness. Generally, SPM-based methods produced the most consistent volumetrics, while FreeSurfer was more robust for WM volumes on different scanners. FreeSurfer had more robust normalised brain and GM volumes on different scanners than FSL-SIENAX (p=0.004). MS lesion filling changed the output of FSL-SIENAX, SPM and SPM-CAT but not FreeSurfer.\nConsistent use of the same scanner is essential and normalisation to the intracranial volume is recommended for multiple scanners. Based on robustness, SPM-based methods are particularly suitable for cross-sectional volumetry. FreeSurfer poses a suitable alternative with WM segmentations less sensitive to MS lesions.\n\u2022 The same scanner should be used for brain volumetry. If different scanners are used, the intracranial volume normalisation improves the FreeSurfer and SPM robustness (but not the FSL scaling factor). \u2022 FreeSurfer, FSL and SPM all provide robust measures of the whole brain volume on the same MRI scanner. SPM-based methods overall provide the most robust segmentations (except white matter segmentations on different scanners where FreeSurfer is more robust). \u2022 MS lesion filling with Lesion Segmentation Toolbox changes the output of FSL-SIENAX and SPM. FreeSurfer output is not affected by MS lesion filling since it already takes white matter hypointensities into account and is therefore particularly suitable for MS brain volumetry.",

    "abstract": "Quality assurance (QA) is vital for ensuring the integrity of processed neuroimaging data for use in clinical neurosciences research. Manual QA (visual inspection) of processed brains for cortical surface reconstruction errors is resource-intensive, particularly with large datasets. Several semi-automated QA tools use quantitative detection of subjects for editing based on outlier brain regions. There were two project goals: (1) evaluate the assumption that statistical outliers are related to errors of cortical extension, and (2) examine whether error identification and correction significantly impacts estimation of cortical parameters and established brain-behavior relationships. T1 MPRAGE images (N\u2009=\u2009530) of healthy adults were obtained from the NKI-Rockland Sample and reconstructed using Freesurfer 5.3. Visual inspection of T1 images was conducted for: (1) participants (n\u2009=\u2009110) with outlier values (z scores \u00b13 SD) for subcortical and cortical segmentation volumes (outlier group), and (2) a random sample of remaining participants (n\u2009=\u2009110) with segmentation values that did not meet the outlier criterion (non-outlier group). The outlier group had 21% more participants with visual inspection-identified errors than participants in the non-outlier group, with a medium effect size (\u03a6\u2009=\u20090.22). Nevertheless, a considerable portion of images with errors of cortical extension were found in the non-outlier group (41%). Although nine brain regions significantly changed size from pre- to post-editing (with effect sizes ranging from 0.26 to 0.59), editing did not substantially change the correlations of neurocognitive tasks and brain volumes (ps\u2009>\u20090.05). Statistically-based QA, although less resource intensive, is not accurate enough to supplant visual inspection. We discuss practical implications of our findings to guide resource allocation decisions for image processing.",

    "abstract": "It is important to have accurate estimates of normal age-related brain structure changes and to understand how the choice of measurement technique may bias those estimates. We compared longitudinal change in hippocampal volume, laterality and atrophy measured by manual tracing and FreeSurfer (version 5.3) in middle age (n\u2009=\u2009244, 47.2[1.4] years) and older age (n\u2009=\u2009199, 67.0[1.4] years) individuals over 8\u00a0years. The proportion of overlap (Dice coefficient) between the segmented hippocampi was calculated and we hypothesised that the proportion of overlap would be higher for older individuals as a consequence of higher atrophy. Hippocampal volumes produced by FreeSurfer were larger than manually traced volumes. Both methods produced a left less than right volume laterality difference. Over time this laterality difference increased for manual tracing and decreased for FreeSurfer leading to laterality differences in left and right estimated atrophy rates. The overlap proportion between methods was not significantly different for older individuals, but was greater for the right hippocampus. Estimated middle age annualised atrophy rates were -\u20090.39(1.0) left, 0.07(1.01) right, -\u20090.17(0.88) total for manual tracing and -\u20090.15(0.69) left, -\u20090.20(0.63) right, -\u20090.18(0.57) total for FreeSurfer. Older age atrophy rates were -\u20090.43(1.32) left, -\u20090.15(1.41) right, -\u20090.30 (1.23) total for manual tracing and -\u20090.34(0.79) left, -\u20090.68(0.78) right, -\u20090.51(0.65) total for FreeSurfer. FreeSurfer reliably segments the hippocampus producing atrophy rates that are comparable to manual tracing with some biases that need to be considered in study design. FreeSurfer is suited for use in large longitudinal studies where it is not cost effective to use manual tracing.",

    "abstract": "The results of most neuroimaging studies are reported in volumetric (e.g., MNI152) or surface (e.g., fsaverage) coordinate systems. Accurate mappings between volumetric and surface coordinate systems can facilitate many applications, such as projecting fMRI group analyses from MNI152/Colin27 to fsaverage for visualization or projecting resting-state fMRI parcellations from fsaverage to MNI152/Colin27 for volumetric analysis of new data. However, there has been surprisingly little research on this topic. Here, we evaluated three approaches for mapping data between MNI152/Colin27 and fsaverage coordinate systems by simulating the above applications: projection of group-average data from MNI152/Colin27 to fsaverage and projection of fsaverage parcellations to MNI152/Colin27. Two of the approaches are currently widely used. A third approach (registration fusion) was previously proposed, but not widely adopted. Two implementations of the registration fusion (RF) approach were considered, with one implementation utilizing the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). We found that RF-ANTs performed the best for mapping between fsaverage and MNI152/Colin27, even for new subjects registered to MNI152/Colin27 using a different software tool (FSL FNIRT). This suggests that RF-ANTs would be useful even for researchers not using ANTs. Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the most optimal approach for mapping data to a coordinate system (e.g., fsaverage) is to register individual subjects directly to the coordinate system, rather than via another coordinate system. Only in scenarios where the optimal approach is not possible (e.g., mapping previously published results from MNI152 to fsaverage), should the approaches evaluated in this manuscript be considered. In these scenarios, we recommend RF-ANTs (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/registration/Wu2017_RegistrationFusion).",

    "abstract": "MRI has become an indispensable tool for brain volumetric studies, with the hippocampus an important region of interest. Automation of the MRI segmentation process has helped advance the field by facilitating the volumetric analysis of larger cohorts and more studies. FreeSurfer has emerged as the de facto standard tool for these analyses, but studies validating its output are all based on older versions. To characterize FreeSurfer's validity, we compare several versions of FreeSurfer software with traditional hand-tracing. Using MRI images of 262 males and 402 females aged 38 to 84, we directly compare estimates of hippocampal volume from multiple versions of FreeSurfer, its hippocampal subfield routines, and our manual tracing protocol. We then use those estimates to assess asymmetry and atrophy, comparing performance of different estimators with each other and with brain atrophy measures. FreeSurfer consistently reports larger volumes than manual tracing. This difference is smaller in larger hippocampi or older people, with these biases weaker in version 6.0.0 than prior versions. All methods tested agree qualitatively on rightward asymmetry and increasing atrophy in older people. FreeSurfer saves time and money, and approximates the same atrophy measures as manual tracing, but it introduces biases that could require statistical adjustments in some studies.",

    "abstract": "Segmentation of human brain structures is crucial for the volumetric quantification of brain disease. Advances in algorithmic approaches have led to automated techniques that save time compared to interactive methods. Recently, the utility and accuracy of template library fusion algorithms, such as Local MAP PSTAPLE (PSTAPLE), have been demonstrated but there is little guidance regarding its reproducibility compared to single template-based algorithms such as FreeSurfer and FSL-FIRST.\nEight repeated magnetic resonance imagings of 20 subjects were segmented using FreeSurfer, FSL-FIRST, and PSTAPLE. We reported the reproducibility of segmentation-derived volume measurements for brain structures and calculated sample size estimates for detecting hypothetical rates of tissue atrophy given the observed variances.\nPSTAPLE had the most reproducible volume measurements for hippocampus, putamen, thalamus, caudate, pallidum, amygdala, Accumbens area, and cortical regions. FreeSurfer was most reproducible for brainstem. PSTAPLE was the most accurate algorithm in terms of several metrics include Dice's coefficient. The sample size estimates showed that a study utilizing PSTAPLE would require tens to hundreds less subjects than the other algorithms for detecting atrophy rates typically observed in brain disease.\nPSTAPLE is a useful tool for automatic human brain segmentation due to its precision and accuracy, which enable the detection of the size of the effect typically reported for neurological disorders with a substantially reduced sample size, in comparison to the other tools we assessed. This enables randomized controlled trials to be executed with reduced cost and duration, in turn, facilitating the assessment of new therapeutic interventions.",
