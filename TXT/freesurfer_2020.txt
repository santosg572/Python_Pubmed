    "abstract": "White matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin are frequently found in MRIs of healthy older adults. WMH are also associated with aging and cognitive decline. Here, we compared and validated three algorithms for WMH extraction: FreeSurfer (T1w), UBO Detector (T1w\u2009+\u2009FLAIR), and FSL's Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm (BIANCA; T1w\u2009+\u2009FLAIR) using a longitudinal dataset comprising MRI data of cognitively healthy older adults (baseline N\u00a0=\u00a0231, age range 64-87\u2009years). As reference we manually segmented WMH in T1w, three-dimensional (3D) FLAIR, and two-dimensional (2D) FLAIR images which were used to assess the segmentation accuracy of the different automated algorithms. Further, we assessed the relationships of WMH volumes provided by the algorithms with Fazekas scores and age. FreeSurfer underestimated the WMH volumes and scored worst in Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC\u00a0=\u00a00.434) but its WMH volumes strongly correlated with the Fazekas scores (r",

    "abstract": "Large-scale longitudinal and multi-centre studies are used to explore neuroimaging markers of normal ageing, and neurodegenerative and mental health disorders. Longitudinal changes in brain structure are typically small, therefore the reliability of automated techniques is crucial. Determining the effects of different factors on reliability allows investigators to control those adversely affecting reliability, calculate statistical power, or even avoid particular brain measures with low reliability. This study examined the impact of several image acquisition and processing factors and documented the test-retest reliability of structural MRI measurements.\nIn Phase I, 20 healthy adults (11 females; aged 20-30 years) were scanned on two occasions three weeks apart on the same scanner using the ADNI-3 protocol. On each occasion, individuals were scanned twice (repetition), after re-entering the scanner (reposition) and after tilting their head forward. At one year follow-up, nine returning individuals and 11 new volunteers were recruited for Phase II (11 females; aged 22-31 years). Scans were acquired on two different scanners using the ADNI-2 and ADNI-3 protocols. Structural images were processed using FreeSurfer (v5.3.0, 6.0.0 and 7.1.0) to provide subcortical and cortical volume, cortical surface area and thickness measurements. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to estimate test-retest reliability. We examined the effect of repetition, reposition, head tilt, time between scans, MRI sequence and scanner on reliability of structural brain measurements. Mean percentage differences were also calculated in supplementary analyses.\nUsing the FreeSurfer v7.1.0 longitudinal pipeline, we observed high reliability for subcortical and cortical volumes, and cortical surface areas at repetition, reposition, three weeks and one year (mean ICCs>0.97). Cortical thickness reliability was lower (mean ICCs>0.82). Head tilt had the greatest adverse impact on ICC estimates, for example reducing mean right cortical thickness to ICC=0.74. In contrast, changes in ADNI sequence or MRI scanner had a minimal effect. We observed an increase in reliability for updated FreeSurfer versions, with the longitudinal pipeline consistently having a higher reliability than the cross-sectional pipeline.\nLongitudinal studies should monitor or control head tilt to maximise reliability. We provided the ICC estimates and mean percentage differences for all FreeSurfer brain regions, which may inform power analyses for clinical studies and have implications for the design of future longitudinal studies.",

    "abstract": "A test-retest study of FreeSurfer derived cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and cortical volume, as well as quantitative R1 relaxometry assessed on the midpoint of the cortex, was performed on a cohort of pediatric subjects (6-12 years old) scanned without sedation using SNARE-MPnRAGE (self navigated retrospective motion corrected magnetization prepared with n rapid gradient echoes) imaging. Reliability was assessed with coefficients of variation (CoVs) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and statistical tests were used to determine differences with and without SNARE motion correction. Comparison of the test-retest measures of SNARE-MPnRAGE with prospectively motion corrected PROMO MPRAGE were also performed. When SNARE motion correction was used all parameters had statistically significant improvements and demonstrated high reliability. Reliability varied depending on parameter, region, and measurement type (vertex or region of interest). For mean thickness/surface area/volume/mean R1 across the regions of FreeSurfer's DK Atlas, the mean CoVs (% x100) were (1.2/1.6/1.9/0.9) and the mean ICCs were (0.88/0.96/0.94/0.83). When assessed on a per-vertex basis, the CoVs and ICCs for thickness/R1 had mean values of (2.9/1.9) and (0.82/0.68) across the regions of the DK Atlas. Retrospectively motion corrected MPnRAGE had significantly lower CoVs and higher ICCs for the morphological measures than PROMO MPRAGE. Motion correction effectively removed motion related biases in nearly all regions for R1 and morphometric measures.",

    "abstract": "The cortical thickness has been used as a biomarker to assess different cerebral conditions and to detect alterations in the cortical mantle. In this work, we compare methods from the FreeSurfer software, the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12), a Laplacian approach and a new method here proposed, based on the Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT), and its corresponding computational phantom designed to validate the calculation algorithm. At region of interest (ROI) level, within- and inter-method comparisons were carried out with a test-retest analysis, in a subset comprising 21 healthy subjects taken from the Multi-Modal MRI Reproducibility Resource (MMRR) dataset. From the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease (MIRIAD) data, classification methods were compared in their performance to detect cortical thickness differences between 23 healthy controls (HC) and 45 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The validation of the proposed EDT-based method showed a more accurate and precise distance measurement as voxel resolution increased. For the within-method comparisons, mean test-retest measures (percentages differences/intraclass correlation/Pearson correlation) were similar for FreeSurfer (1.80%/0.90/0.95), CAT12 (1.91%/0.83/0.91), Laplacian (1.27%/0.89/0.95) and EDT (2.20%/0.88/0.94). Inter-method correlations showed moderate to strong values (R\u2009>\u20090.77) and, in the AD comparison study, all methods were able to detect cortical alterations between groups. Surface- and voxel-based methods have advantages and drawbacks regarding computational demands and measurement precision, while thickness definition was mainly associated to the cortical thickness absolute differences among methods. However, for each method, measurements were reliable, followed similar trends along the cortex and allowed detection of cortical atrophies between HC and patients with AD.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to early life trauma is common and confers risk for psychological disorders in adolescence, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Trauma exposure and PTSD are also consistently linked to alterations in gray matter volume (GMV). Despite the quantity of structural neuroimaging research in trauma-exposed populations, little consensus exists amongst research groups on best practices for image processing method and manual editing procedures. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the utility of manual editing of magnetic resonance (MR) images for detecting PTSD-related group differences in GMV. Here, T1-weighted MR images from adolescent girls aged 11-17 were obtained and analyzed. Two datasets were created from the FreeSurfer reconall pipeline, one of which was manually edited by trained research assistants. Gray matter regions of interest were selected and total volume estimates were entered into linear mixed effects models with method (manual edits or automated) as a within-subjects factor and group dummy-coded with PTSD as the reference group. Consistent with prior literature, individuals with PTSD demonstrated reduced GMV of the amygdala compared to trauma-exposed and non-trauma exposed controls, independent of editing method. Our results demonstrate that amygdala GMV reductions in PTSD are robust to certain methodological choices and do not suggest a benefit to the time-intensive manual editing pipeline in FreeSurfer for quantifying PTSD-related GMV.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and reliable whole-brain segmentation is critical to longitudinal neuroimaging studies. We undertake a comparative analysis of two subcortical segmentation methods, Automatic Segmentation (ASEG) and Sequence Adaptive Multimodal Segmentation (SAMSEG), recently provided in the open-source neuroimaging package FreeSurfer 7.1, with regard to reliability, bias, sensitivity to detect longitudinal change, and diagnostic sensitivity to Alzheimer's disease. First, we assess intra- and inter-scanner reliability for eight bilateral subcortical structures: amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, lateral ventricles, nucleus accumbens, pallidum, putamen and thalamus. For intra-scanner analysis we use a large sample of participants (n\u00a0=\u00a01629) distributed across the lifespan (age range\u00a0=\u00a04-93 years) and acquired on a 1.5T Siemens Avanto (n\u00a0=\u00a0774) and a 3T Siemens Skyra (n\u00a0=\u00a0855) scanners. For inter-scanner analysis we use a sample of 24 participants scanned on the day with three models of Siemens scanners: 1.5T Avanto, 3T Skyra and 3T Prisma. Second, we test how each method detects volumetric age change using longitudinal follow up scans (n\u00a0=\u00a0491 for Avanto and n\u00a0=\u00a0245 for Skyra; interscan interval\u00a0=\u00a01-10 years). Finally, we test sensitivity to clinically relevant change. We compare annual rate of hippocampal atrophy in cognitively normal older adults (n\u00a0=\u00a020), patients with mild cognitive impairment (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and Alzheimer's disease (n\u00a0=\u00a020). We find that both ASEG and SAMSEG are reliable and lead to the detection of within-person longitudinal change, although with notable differences between age-trajectories for most structures, including hippocampus and amygdala. In summary, SAMSEG yields significantly lower differences between repeated measures for intra- and inter-scanner analysis without compromising sensitivity to changes and demonstrating ability to detect clinically relevant longitudinal changes.",

    "abstract": "Depression is the most frequent psychiatric comorbidity in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and hippocampal sclerosis (HS). This study aimed to confirm whether patients with comorbid depression have different volumetric patterns on magnetic resonance imaging, analysing the influence of HS sides. Psychiatrists conducted semi-structured interviews with 75 patients, who were divided into non-depression group (NDG, n\u00a0=\u00a052) and depression group (DG, n\u00a0=\u00a023), and compared with 98 controls. The FreeSurfer software was used in the volumetric analysis of the estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV), bilateral cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs), and for presence of left (L-, n\u00a0=\u00a041) or right (R-, n\u00a0=\u00a034) MTLE-HS. Twenty-three (30.7%) patients had depression, of whom 14 (34.1%) had l-MTLE-HS and 9 (26.5%) had R-MTLE-HS. No difference was observed between DG and NDG vs. controls in terms of eTIV and cortical ROIs, regardless of the severity of depression. In patients with l-MTLE-HS, the eTIV in the DG was reduced in comparison with that in the NDG and control group, with a small effect size. Hippocampal reduction occurred ipsilateral to HS in the l-MTLE-HS and R-MTLE-HS subgroups when DG and NDG were compared with controls, as expected according to Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (2018).",

The intermethod reproducibility was better in the 1.0-mm group than the 1.2-mm group in all regions other than the nucleus accumbens.\nInbrain and FreeSurfer showed good-to-excellent intermethod reproducibility for volumetric measurements.

    "abstract": "Volumetric estimates of subcortical and cortical structures, extracted from T1-weighted MRIs, are widely used in many clinical and research applications. Here, we investigate the impact of the presence of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on FreeSurfer gray matter (GM) structure volumes and its possible bias on functional relationships. T1-weighted images from 1,077 participants (4,321 timepoints) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were processed with FreeSurfer version 6.0.0. WMHs were segmented using a previously validated algorithm on either T2-weighted or Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Mixed-effects models were used to assess the relationships between overlapping WMHs and GM structure volumes and overall WMH burden, as well as to investigate whether such overlaps impact associations with age, diagnosis, and cognitive performance. Participants with higher WMH volumes had higher overlaps with GM volumes of bilateral caudate, cerebral cortex, putamen, thalamus, pallidum, and accumbens areas (p\u2009<\u2009.0001). When not corrected for WMHs, caudate volumes increased with age (p\u2009<\u2009.0001) and were not different between cognitively healthy individuals and age-matched probable Alzheimer's disease patients. After correcting for WMHs, caudate volumes decreased with age (p\u2009<\u2009.0001), and Alzheimer's disease patients had lower caudate volumes than cognitively healthy individuals (p\u2009<\u2009.01). Uncorrected caudate volume was not associated with ADAS13 scores, whereas corrected lower caudate volumes were significantly associated with poorer cognitive performance (p\u2009<\u2009.0001). Presence of WMHs leads to systematic inaccuracies in GM segmentations, particularly for the caudate, which can also change clinical associations. While specifically measured for the Freesurfer toolkit, this problem likely affects other algorithms.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the inter-method reliability and volumetric differences between NeuroQuant (NQ) and Freesurfer (FS) using T1 volume imaging sequence with different slice thicknesses in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nThis retrospective study enrolled 80 patients diagnosed with MCI at our memory clinic. NQ and FS were used for volumetric analysis of three-dimensional T1-weighted images with slice thickness of 1 and 1.2 mm. Inter-method reliability was measured with Pearson correlation coefficient (r), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and effect size (ES).\nOverall, NQ volumes were larger than FS volumes in several locations: whole brain (0.78%), cortical gray matter (5.34%), and white matter (2.68%). Volume measures by NQ and FS showed good-to-excellent ICCs with both 1 and 1.2 mm slice thickness (ICC=0.75-0.97, ES=-1.0-0.73 vs. ICC=0.78-0.96, ES=-0.9-0.77, respectively), except for putamen, pallidum, thalamus, and total intracranial volumes. The ICCs in all locations, except the putamen and cerebellum, were slightly higher with a slice thickness of 1 mm compared to those of 1.2 mm.\nInter-method reliability between NQ and FS was good-to-excellent in most regions with improvement with a 1-mm slice thickness.

    "abstract": "Structural hippocampal abnormalities are common in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, and variation in hippocampal measures is related to cognitive performance and other complex phenotypes such as stress sensitivity. Hippocampal subregions are increasingly studied, as automated algorithms have become available for mapping and volume quantification. In the context of the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis Consortium, several Disease Working Groups are using the FreeSurfer software to analyze hippocampal subregion (subfield) volumes in patients with neurological and psychiatric conditions along with data from matched controls. In this overview, we explain the algorithm's principles, summarize measurement reliability studies, and demonstrate two additional aspects (subfield autocorrelation and volume/reliability correlation) with illustrative data. We then explain the rationale for a standardized hippocampal subfield segmentation quality control (QC) procedure for improved pipeline harmonization. To guide researchers to make optimal use of the algorithm, we discuss how global size and age effects can be modeled, how QC steps can be incorporated and how subfields may be aggregated into composite volumes. This discussion is based on a synopsis of 162 published neuroimaging studies (01/2013-12/2019) that applied the FreeSurfer hippocampal subfield segmentation in a broad range of domains including cognition and healthy aging, brain development and neurodegeneration, affective disorders, psychosis, stress regulation, neurotoxicity, epilepsy, inflammatory disease, childhood adversity and posttraumatic stress disorder, and candidate and whole genome (epi-)genetics. Finally, we highlight points where FreeSurfer-based hippocampal subfield studies may be optimized.",

    "abstract": "There are instances in which an estimate of the brain volume should be obtained from MRI in clinical practice. Our objective is to calculate cross-sectional robustness of a convolutional neural network (CNN) based software (Entelai Pic) for brain volume estimation and compare it to traditional software such as FreeSurfer, CAT12 and FSL in healthy controls (HC).\nSixteen HC were scanned four times, two different days on two different MRI scanners (1.5\u202fT and 3\u202fT). Volumetric T1-weighted images were acquired and post-processed with FreeSurfer v6.0.0, Entelai Pic v2, CAT12 v12.5 and FSL v5.0.9. Whole-brain, grey matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes were calculated. Correlation and agreement between methods was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland Altman plots. Robustness was assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV).\nWhole-brain volume estimation had better correlation between FreeSurfer and Entelai Pic (ICC (95% CI) 0.96 (0.94-0.97)) than FreeSurfer and CAT12 (0.92 (0.88-0.96)) and FSL (0.87 (0.79-0.91)). WM, GM and CSF showed a similar trend. Compared to FreeSurfer, Entelai Pic provided similarly robust segmentations of brain volumes both on same-scanner (mean CV 1.07, range 0.20-3.13% vs. mean CV 1.05, range 0.21-3.20%, p\u202f=\u202f0.86) and on different-scanner variables (mean CV 3.84, range 2.49-5.91% vs. mean CV 3.84, range 2.62-5.13%, p\u202f=\u202f0.96). Mean post-processing times were 480, 5, 40 and 5\u202fmin for FreeSurfer, Entelai Pic, CAT12 and FSL respectively.\nBased on robustness and processing times, our CNN-based model is suitable for cross-sectional volumetry on clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of brain anatomy has been a key processing step in quantitative neuroimaging analyses. An extensive body of literature has relied on Freesurfer segmentations. Yet, in recent years, the multi-atlas segmentation framework has consistently obtained results with superior accuracy in various evaluations. We compared brain anatomy segmentations from Freesurfer, which uses a single probabilistic atlas strategy, against segmentations from Multi-atlas region Segmentation utilizing Ensembles of registration algorithms and parameters and locally optimal atlas selection (MUSE), one of the leading ensemble-based methods that calculates a consensus segmentation through fusion of anatomical labels from multiple atlases and registrations. The focus of our evaluation was twofold. First, using manual ground-truth hippocampus segmentations, we found that Freesurfer segmentations showed a bias towards over-segmentation of larger hippocampi, and under-segmentation in older age. This bias was more pronounced in Freesurfer-v5.3, which has been used in multiple previous studies of aging, while the effect was mitigated in more recent Freesurfer-v6.0, albeit still present. Second, we evaluated inter-scanner segmentation stability using same day scan pairs from ADNI acquired on 1.5T and 3T scanners. We also found that MUSE obtains more consistent segmentations across scanners compared to Freesurfer, particularly in the deep structures.",

    "abstract": "In recent years a number of semi-automated and automated segmentation tools and brain atlases have been developed to facilitate morphometric analyses of large MRI datasets. These tools are much faster than manual tracing and demonstrate excellent test-retest reliabilities. Reliabilities of automated segmentations relative to \"gold standard\" manual tracings have, however, been shown to vary by brain region and in different cohorts. It remains uncertain to what extent smaller brain volumes and potential changes in grey/white matter contrasts in paediatric brains impact on the performance of automated methods, and how pathology may influence performance. This study examined whether using data from automated FreeSurfer segmentation would alter our ability, compared to manual segmentation, to detect prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related volume changes in subcortical regions and the corpus callosum (CC) in pre-adolescent children. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired, using a sequence optimized for morphometric neuroanatomical analysis, on a Siemens 3T Allegra MRI scanner in 71 right-handed, 9- to 11-year-old children (27 fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (PFAS), 25 non-syndromal heavily exposed (HE) and 19 non-exposed controls) from a high-risk community in Cape Town, South Africa. Data from timeline follow-back interviews administered to the mothers prospectively during pregnancy were used to quantify the amount of alcohol (in ounces absolute alcohol per day, AA/day) that the children had been exposed to prenatally. Volumes of corpus callosum (CC) and bilateral caudate nuclei, hippocampi and nucleus accumbens (NA) were obtained by manual tracing and automated segmentation using both FreeSurfer versions 5.1 and 6.0. Reliability across methods was assessed using intraclass correlation (ICC) estimates for consistency and absolute agreement, and Cronbach's \u03b1. Ability to detect regions showing PAE effects was assessed separately for each segmentation method using ANOVA and linear regression of regional volumes with AA/day. Our results support findings from other studies showing excellent reliability across methods for easy-to-segment structures, such as the CC and caudate nucleus. Volumes from FreeSurfer 6.0 were smaller than those from version 5.1 in all regions except the right caudate, for which they were similar, and right hippocampus and CC, for which they were larger. Despite poor absolute agreement between methods in the NA and hippocampus, all three segmentation methods detected dose-dependent volume reductions in regions for which reliabilities on ICC consistency across methods reached at least 0.70, namely the CC, and bilateral caudate nuclei and hippocampi. PAE-related changes in the NA for which ICC consistency did not reach this minimum were inconsistent across methods and should be interpreted with caution. This is the first study to demonstrate in a pre-adolescent cohort the ability of automated segmentation with FreeSurfer to detect regional volume changes associated with pathology similar to those found using manual tracing.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia can be considered a brain disconnectivity condition related to aberrant neurodevelopment that causes alterations in the brain structure, including gyrification of the cortex. Literature findings on cortical folding are incoherent: they report hypogyria in the frontal, superior-parietal and temporal cortices, but also frontal hypergyria. This discrepancy in local gyrification index (LGI) results could be due to the commonly used spherical kernel (Freesurfer), which is a method of analysis that is still not spatially precise enough. In this study we would like to test the spatial accuracy of a novel method based on a shape-adaptive kernel (Cmorph). The analysis of differences in gyrification between chronic schizophrenia outpatients (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 30) was conducted with two methods: Freesurfer LGI and Cmorph LGI. Widespread differences in the LGI between schizophrenia outpatients and healthy controls were found using both methods. Freesurfer showed hypogyria in the superior temporal gyrus and the right temporal pole; it also showed hypergyria in the rostral-middle-frontal cortex in schizophrenia outpatients. In comparison, Cmorph revealed that hypergyria is equally represented as hypogyria in orbitofrontal and central brain regions. The clusters from Cmorph were smaller and distributed more broadly, covering all lobes of the brain. The presented evidence from disrupted cortical folding in schizophrenia indicates that the shape-adaptive kernel approach has a potential to improve the knowledge on the disrupted cortical folding in schizophrenia; therefore, it could be a valuable tool for further investigation on big sample size.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the aggregation of amyloid-\u03b2 and phosphorylated tau proteins. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful means of detecting hippocampal atrophy. However, instead of visual inspection, objective and time-saving tools for automated region of interest (ROI) analysis are needed. Advances in MRI segmentation techniques have enabled a multi-atlas approach with fewer errors than a conventional single-atlas approach. To support the clinical application of multi-atlas segmentation, an automated ROI analytic application consisting of multi-atlas segmentation with joint label fusion and corrective learning was developed: T-Proto. In the present study, we evaluated the inter-method reliability between T-Proto and a reference ROI analytic software, FreeSurfer.\nThis was a database study. MRI data from 30 patients with AD were selected, and the inter-method reliability was assessed in terms of the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). A post-hoc comparison according to the severity of AD was also performed.\nAlmost all the regional volumes estimated with T-Proto were smaller than those estimated with FreeSurfer. The regional ICC values between the two methods showed moderate to excellent reliability. A post-hoc comparison revealed a similar t-value and effect size between both methods for the hippocampus.\nIn the present study, we showed that automated regional analysis using T-Proto was reliable in the hippocampus in terms of ICC, compared with FreeSurfer.",

    "abstract": "The development of automated tools for brain morphometric analysis in infants has lagged significantly behind analogous tools for adults. This gap reflects the greater challenges in this domain due to: 1) a smaller-scaled region of interest, 2) increased motion corruption, 3) regional changes in geometry due to heterochronous growth, and 4) regional variations in contrast properties corresponding to ongoing myelination and other maturation processes. Nevertheless, there is a great need for automated image-processing tools to quantify differences between infant groups and other individuals, because aberrant cortical morphologic measurements (including volume, thickness, surface area, and curvature) have been associated with neuropsychiatric, neurologic, and developmental disorders in children. In this paper we present an automated segmentation and surface extraction pipeline designed to accommodate clinical MRI studies of infant brains in a population 0-2 year-olds. The algorithm relies on a single channel of T1-weighted MR images to achieve automated segmentation of cortical and subcortical brain areas, producing volumes of subcortical structures and surface models of the cerebral cortex. We evaluated the algorithm both qualitatively and quantitatively using manually labeled datasets, relevant comparator software solutions cited in the literature, and expert evaluations. The computational tools and atlases described in this paper will be distributed to the research community as part of the FreeSurfer image analysis package.",

    "abstract": "Insights into brain anatomy are important for the early detection of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as dyslexia. FreeSurfer is one of the most frequently applied automatized software tools to study brain morphology. However, quality control of the outcomes provided by FreeSurfer is often ignored and could lead to wrong statistical inferences. Additional manual editing of the data may be a solution, although not without a cost in time and resources. Past research in adults on comparing the automatized method of FreeSurfer with and without additional manual editing indicated that although editing may lead to significant differences in morphological measures between the methods in some regions, it does not substantially change the sensitivity to detect clinical differences. Given that automated approaches are more likely to fail in pediatric-and inherently more noisy-data, we investigated in the current study whether FreeSurfer can be applied fully automatically or additional manual edits of T1-images are needed in a pediatric sample. Specifically, cortical thickness and surface area measures with and without additional manual edits were compared in six regions of interest (ROIs) of the reading network in 5-to-6-year-old children with and without dyslexia. Results revealed that additional editing leads to statistical differences in the morphological measures, but that these differences are consistent across subjects and that the sensitivity to reveal statistical differences in the morphological measures between children with and without dyslexia is not affected, even though conclusions of marginally significant findings can differ depending on the method used. Thereby, our results indicate that additional manual editing of reading-related regions in FreeSurfer has limited gain for pediatric samples.",

We evaluated two segmentation methods (MAPER and FreeSurfer), using three publicly available atlas databases (Hammers_mith, Desikan-Killiany-Tourville, and MICCAI 2012 Grand Challenge). For each combination of atlas and method, we conducted a leave-one-out cross-comparison to estimate the segmentation accuracy of FreeSurfer and MAPER. We also used each possible combination to segment two datasets of patients with known structural abnormalities (Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (HS)) and their matched healthy controls. MAPER was better than FreeSurfer at modelling manual segmentations in the healthy control leave-one-out analyses in two of the three atlas databases, and the Hammers_mith atlas database transferred to new datasets best regardless of segmentation method. Both segmentation methods reliably identified known abnormalities in each patient group. Better separation was seen for FreeSurfer in the AD and left-HS datasets, and for MAPER in the right-HS dataset. We provide detailed quantitative comparisons for multiple anatomical regions, thus enabling researchers to make evidence-based decisions on their choice of atlas and segmentation method.",

    "abstract": "The human hippocampus is vulnerable to a range of degenerative conditions and as such, accurate in vivo measurement of the hippocampus and hippocampal substructures via neuroimaging is of great interest for understanding mechanisms of disease as well as for use as a biomarker in clinical trials of novel therapeutics. Although total hippocampal volume can be measured relatively reliably, it is critical to understand how this reliability is affected by acquisition on different scanners, as multiple scanning platforms would likely be utilized in large-scale clinical trials. This is particularly true for hippocampal subregional measurements, which have only relatively recently been measurable through common image processing platforms such as FreeSurfer. Accurate segmentation of these subregions is challenging due to their small size, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal loss in medial temporal regions of the brain, and lack of contrast for delineation from standard neuroimaging procedures. Here, we assess the test-retest reliability of the FreeSurfer automated hippocampal subfield segmentation procedure using two Siemens model scanners (a Siemens Trio and Prisma",

    "abstract": "Automated neuroimaging methods like FreeSurfer ( https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/ ) have revolutionized quantitative neuroimaging analyses. Such analyses provide a variety of metrics used for image quantification, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetrics. With the release of FreeSurfer version 6.0, it is important to assess its comparability to the widely-used previous version 5.3. The current study used data from the initial 249 participants in the ongoing Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC) multicenter observational study to compare the volumetric output of versions 5.3 and 6.0 across various regions of interest (ROI). In the current investigation, the following ROIs were examined: total intracranial volume, total white matter volume, total ventricular volume, total gray matter volume, and right and left volumes for the thalamus, pallidum, putamen, caudate, amygdala and hippocampus. Absolute ROI volumes derived from FreeSurfer 6.0 differed significantly from those obtained using version 5.3. We also employed a clinically-based evaluation strategy to compare both versions in their prediction of age-mediated volume reductions (or ventricular increase) in the aforementioned structures. Statistical comparison involved both general linear modeling (GLM) and random forest (RF) methods, where cross-validation error was significantly higher using segmentations from FreeSurfer version 5.3 versus version 6.0 (GLM: t\u2009=\u20094.97, df\u2009=\u200999, p value\u2009=\u20092.706e-06; RF: t\u2009=\u20094.85, df\u2009=\u200999, p value\u2009=\u20094.424e-06). Additionally, the relative importance of ROIs used to predict age using RFs differed between FreeSurfer versions, indicating substantial differences in the two versions. However, from the perspective of correlational analyses, fitted regression lines and their slopes were similar between the two versions, regardless of version used. While absolute volumes are not interchangeable between version 5.3 and 6.0, ROI correlational analyses appear to yield similar results, suggesting the interchangeability of ROI volume for correlational studies.",
