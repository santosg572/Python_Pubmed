    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK) is the characteristic aromatic compound in raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) with wide applications as food additive and anti-obesity agent. However, quantification of RK has presented difficulties in MS detection and reliable LC-MS method for RK analysis in literature is in limit to date. In order to facilitate quality control of raspberry derived products and RK metabolomics study, this study aimed to develop a validated and sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS method. Strong in-source fragmentation was noted and the fragmental ion of 107\u00a0m/z produced was selected as the precursor ion for MRM detection, and as such the electrospray ionization performance was optimized by fractional factorial design to accommodate such ion-source dissociation behavior as well as its moderate volatility. A pathway involving the formation of quinone-like structure with strong conjugation was proposed to explain the intense in-source fragmentation. The MRM transition was optimized with product ion of 77\u00a0m/z selected as the quantifier ion. The method featured low limit of quantification of \u223c2\u00a0ng/mL and allowed for rapid detection of RK in fresh raspberries following direct sample preparation. RK contents were found to be higher from locally grown and harvested farm sources compared to commercial products shipped into the state, and higher in those at late-stage compared with early-stage maturity. No correlations in RK content between organic and non-organic labels were noted.",

    "abstract": "Sixty percent of the $109 million processed red raspberry industry of the United States occurs in northern Washington State. In 2012, late-summer symptoms of vascular wilt and root disease were observed in many raspberry plantings. These symptoms were initially attributed to Verticillium dahliae. However, diagnostic tests for the pathogen were often contradictory and other soilborne pathogens (Phytophthora rubi and Pratylenchus penetrans) or Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) might also have been involved. Therefore, a survey was conducted in 2013 and 2014 to (i) establish the incidence and soil population levels of V. dahliae in red raspberry production fields, (ii) compare among diagnostic methods and laboratories for detecting and quantifying V. dahliae from raspberry field soil, and (iii) assess which pathogens are associated with late-summer disease symptoms of raspberry. Plant and soil samples were collected from 51 disease sites and 20 healthy sites located in 24 production fields. Samples were analyzed for the presence and quantity of each pathogen using traditional plating and extraction methods (V. dahliae, P. rubi, and P. penetrans), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (V. dahliae and P. rubi), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (RBDV). Results showed that V. dahliae was present in 88% of the production fields and that detection of the pathogen differed by method and by laboratory: qPCR detected V. dahliae in the soil from approximately three times as many sites (51 of 71 total sites) as by plating on NP10 semi-selective medium (15 of 71 total sites). Soil populations of V. dahliae were slightly greater at disease sites, but the pathogen was detected with similar frequency from healthy sites and it was rarely isolated from diseased plants (4%). P. rubi, P. penetrans, and RBDV were also common in production fields (79, 91, and 53% of fields, respectively). Both P. rubi (soil and root samples) and P. penetrans (root populations only), but not RBDV, were more frequently found at disease sites than healthy sites, and the amount of P. rubi detected by qPCR was greater from disease sites than healthy sites. In addition, P. rubi was isolated from 27% of the symptomatic plants located at disease sites. Regardless of detection method, V. dahliae, P. rubi, and P. penetrans, either with or without RBDV, were more likely to co-occur at disease sites (73%) than healthy sites (35%), suggesting that a soilborne disease complex is present in raspberry production fields. Results indicate that P. rubi is the primary pathogen most strongly associated with late-summer symptoms of disease, but root populations of P. penetrans and higher soil populations of V. dahliae may also be of concern. Therefore, disease control methods should focus on all three soilborne pathogens.",

Antioxidants' usage guarantees skin protection against free radicals and, flavonoids, especially, can act as sunscreen. The aim of this paper was to evaluate solar protection factor (SPF) and antioxidant activity in vitro of blackberry and raspberry extracts incorporated in topical formulation and study their stability.\nRaspberry presented 29.93\u00a0mg of anthocyanins/100\u00a0g of fruit and blackberry 65.58\u00a0mg of anthocyanins/100\u00a0g of fruit. In vitro solar protection factor was 54.57 to blackberry and 37.32 to raspberry. When incorporated in O/W emulsions, final formulations showed light pink color, creamy aspect, and typical fruity odor. Formulations submitted to indirect light and stove showed odor and color alterations.\nBased on the results, formulations containing extracts should be kept under refrigeration in opaque package to ensure stability due to the presence of flavonoids. In addition, blackberry and raspberry extracts are potential natural alternatives to be used as sunscreen and to prevent skin aging.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a continually growing pandemic leading to many diseases that affect the overall quality of life. The widely marketed Garcinia cambogia (GC) and Raspberry ketone (RK) were used in this study. Despite their known dietetic effect, however, the metabolomic/signaling pathways involved in this effect are not fully elucidated. Hence, our study comprehends the possible trajectories of their combination against obesity and insulin resistance in addition to exploring their combination merit.\nAdult male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups; viz., normal diet (ND), high fat fructose diet (HFFD), HFFD+GC (600mg/kg), HFFD+RK (55mg/kg) and HFFD+GC+RK. To assess our aim, we determined their effect on body weight, IPGTT, glucose homeostasis (glucose, insulin, HOMA IR), lipid profile parameters and SREBP-1c, oxidative stress markers, insulin and leptin signaling pathways (p-IRS-1/p-AKT/GLUT-4, and leptin/STAT-3), as well as liver and adipose tissue histopathology.\nGC/RK combinationcaused weight loss, corrected the disturbed glucose and insulin homeostasis, raised serum levels of HDL anddecreased all other lipid profile parameters. They also increased Nrf-2 expression, ad GSH, as well as p-IRS-1/p-Akt/GLUT-4 cue, while they decreased MDA, leptin/STAT-3 and SREBP-1c content compared to the HFFD group. Furthermore, the GC/RK combination abolished apoptosis, fatty changes and inflammation in hepatocytes and decreased sclerotic blood vessels and congestion in adipose tissue.\nOur study highlights the involvement ofp-IRS-1/p-Akt/GLUT-4, leptin/STAT-3 and SREBP-1c signaling trajectories in the beneficial combination of GC and RK, besides, the efficient rebalance of the redox status, insulin resistance and tissue fat deposition confirmed histopathologically.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is faced with challenges that require green solutions and energy-efficient paradigms. Architectures (such as ARM) have evolved significantly in recent years, with improvements to processor efficiency, essential for always-on devices, as a focal point. However, as far as software is concerned, few approaches analyse the advantages of writing efficient code when programming IoT devices. Therefore, this proposal aims to improve source code optimization to achieve better execution times. In addition, the importance of various techniques for writing efficient code for Raspberry Pi devices is analysed, with the objective of increasing execution speed. A complete set of tests have been developed exclusively for analysing and measuring the improvements achieved when applying each of these techniques. This will raise awareness of the significant impact the recommended techniques can have.",

    "abstract": "A product translated from the 1b gene of raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) was specifically detected in RBDV-infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants by immunoblot analysis. To analyze the effects of the 1b gene on virus infection in host plants, an RBDV deletion mutant virus (RB\u22061bstop), which is unable to express the 1b gene, was constructed and inoculated to N. benthamiana plants. The results showed that accumulation of the virus genomic (g) RNAs 1 and 2 decreased in inoculated leaves, and that systemic virus spread was delayed compared with wild-type RBDV. In contrast, accumulation of the viral gRNAs 1 and 2 was elevated in RB\u22061bstop-infected leaf tissues during ectopic expression of the 1b gene. Furthermore, we found that the 1b has weak RNA silencing suppressor activity.",

    "abstract": "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1) controls the lipid and glucose metabolism and also affects inflammation, cell proliferation and apoptosis during cardiovascular disease. Raspberry ketone (RK) is a red raspberry (Rubusidaeus, Family-Rosaceae) plant constituent, which activates PPAR-\u03b1. This study was conducted to assess the cardioprotective action of RK against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiotoxicity. Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups (six rats/group). Rats were orally administered with RK (50, 100 and 200\u202fmg/kg, respectively) and fenofibrate (standard, 80\u202fmg/kg) for 28 days and ISO was administered (85\u202fmg/kg, subcutaneously) on 27th and 28th day. Administration of ISO in rats significantly altered hemodynamic and electrocardiogram patterns, total antioxidant capacity, PPAR-\u03b1, and apolipoprotein C-III levels. These myocardial aberrations were further confirmed during infarct size, heart weight to body weight ratio and immunohistochemical assessments (caspase-3 and nuclear factor-\u03baB). RK pretreatment (100 and 200\u202fmg/kg) significantly protected rats against oxidative stress, inflammation, and dyslipidemia caused by ISO as demonstrated by change in hemodynamic, biochemical and histological parameters. The results so obtained were quite comparable with fenofibrate. Moreover, RK was found to have binding affinity with PPAR-\u03b1, as confirmed by docking analysis. PPAR-\u03b1 expression and concentration was also found increased in presence of RK which gave impression that RK probably showed cardioprotection via PPAR-\u03b1 activation, however direct binding study of RK with PPAR-\u03b1 is needed to confirm this assumption.",

    "abstract": "As important epigenetic regulators, microRNA regulate protein expression by triggering the degradation of target mRNA and/or by inhibiting their translation. Dysregulation of microRNA expression has been reported in several cancers, including colorectal cancer. In this study, microRNA-array differential analysis revealed strongly enhanced expression of miR-24-1-5p in the colon tissue of azoxymethane/dextran sulphate sodium-induced mice that were fed with black raspberry anthocyanins for 9 weeks. Overexpression of miR-24-1-5p in human colorectal cancer cells significantly repressed \u03b2-catenin expression, and simultaneously decreased cell proliferation, migration and survival. Furthermore, miR-24-1-5p could target \u03b2-catenin and trigger a negative regulatory loop for \u03b2-catenin and its downstream target genes. \u03b2-Catenin signalling is vital to the formation and progression of human colorectal cancer. The current findings therefore identified miR-24-1-5p as a potent regulator of \u03b2-catenin, and this may provide a novel chemopreventive and therapeutic strategy for \u03b2-catenin signalling-driven colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Clinical and laboratory studies have implicated black raspberries (BRBs) and their associated phytochemicals in the modulation of several chronic diseases. Most research on the health benefits of BRBs is conducted using freeze-dried or otherwise minimally processed products, yet BRBs are typically consumed as thermally processed goods like jams and syrups. The objective of this work was to profile the chemical changes that result from thermal processing of BRB powder into a nectar beverage. Using an untargeted UHPLC-QTOF-MS metabolomics approach, key degradation products of anthocyanins were identified along with several other proposed phenolic degradants. The effects of processing on other key BRB compound groups, including ellagitannins, are also discussed. This work demonstrates the utility of an untargeted metabolomics approach in describing the chemistry of complex food systems and provides a foundation for future research on the impact of processing on BRB product bioactivity.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry has been well-known for its nutritional purpose. Although this fruit has been reported for its potent antioxidant activity and health-promoting properties, systematic studies responsible for the bioactive constituents were still insufficient. In the current study, three pairs of dihydrobenzofuran-type enantiomeric neolignans (1a/1b-3a/3b), including two new compounds (1b and 2a), were isolated from the fruit of Rubus idaeus. The structures of these enantiomers were determined through spectroscopic methods and quantum mechanical calculations. Biologically, enantiomers 2a and 2b exhibited significant enantioselective protective effects against H",

    "abstract": "Raspberry and blueberry pomace, by-products from fruit juice industry, were dehydrated to obtain fruit fiber concentrates and valorized as ingredients in gluten-free (GF) cookies formulation. The aim was to evaluate the effect of substituting 30% (w/w) of GF flour mixture with different ratios of blueberry/raspberry fiber concentrates (0/30, 15/15, and 30/0) on rheological properties of cookie dough and cookie baking quality. Generally, the incorporation of the fiber concentrates increased the elastic and the viscous moduli thus producing harder doughs and consequently firmer cookies in comparison to the control. Although having similar total, soluble and insoluble fiber content, blueberry fiber concentrates were characterized with higher water absorption capacity and consequently yielded cookies with more rigid dough structure, higher water loss during baking, lower cookie thickness, higher spread ratio, more dense inner structure, and increased cookie hardness than those containing raspberry fiber concentrates. Enrichment of GF cookies with raspberry and blueberry fiber concentrates resulted in products with dietary fiber content higher than 6 g per 100\u2009g, thus making them candidates for bearing \"high fiber\" nutrition claim. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Currently available GF bakery products mostly lack dietary fibers (DFs) and other important nutrients, because they are usually manufactured from refined flour and/or starches. As the products with long shelf-life, very popular in daily diet of almost all consumer profiles, cookies could represent good matrices for the addition of functional ingredients, such as DFs. In this paper, GF cookies were enriched with the fiber concentrates recovered from blueberry and raspberry pomace. Application of these fiber sources enabled recycling of fruit processing industry by-products into novel, \"high fiber\" GF product with improved nutritive profile.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a proven risk factor for neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulating evidences suggested that nutritional interventions provide potential for prevention and treatment of AD. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of dietary treatment of obese rats with natural Raspberry ketone (RK) and their relationship with neurodegeneration. Obesity was first induced in 40 male Wistar rats (140-160\u2009g) by feeding high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Obese rats were then assigned into 4 groups (n\u2009=\u200910 each). (O-AD) is obese induced AD group maintained on HFD for another 6 weeks. OCR is obese group received calorie restricted diet for 6 weeks. OCRRK is obese group received calorie restricted diet and RK (44\u2009mg/kg body weight, daily, orally) for 6 weeks and OCRD is obese group received calorie restricted diet and orlistate (10\u2009mg/kg body weight, daily orally) for 6 weeks. Another 10 normal rats received normal diet were used as normal control group (NC). Body weight, visceral white adipose tissue weight (WAT), lipid profile, oxidative stress markers, adiponectin, cholinergic activity and amyloid extracellular plaques were examined. In addition to histological changes in brain tissues were evaluated.Raspberry ketone (RK) via its antioxidant properties attenuated oxidative damage and dyslipidemia in O-AD group. It inhibited acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AchE) and hence increased acetylcholine level (Ach) in brain tissues of O-AD rats. It is also impeded the upregulation of beta-secretase-1 (BACE-1) and the accumulation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques which crucially involved in AD. The combination of CR diet with RK was more effective than CR diet with orlistate (antiobese drug) in abrogating the neurodegenerative changes induced by obesity. Results from this study suggested that concomitant supplementation of RK with calorie restricted regimen effectively modulate the neurodegenerative changes induced by obesity and delay the progression of AD.",

    "abstract": "The red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is a common fruit worldwide and its extract has been found to inhibit the growth of many types of tumors, mainly because it is rich in bioactive phytochemicals. However, the mechanism underlying its anticancer activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well understood. Herein, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of red raspberry phytochemicals on the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and to elucidate its biochemical and molecular targets. CCK8 and colony formation, as well as flow cytometry assays, were employed to determine the effects of red raspberry extract (RRE) on cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution in HCC cells. Our results showed that RRE significantly inhibited cell proliferation and arrested cell cycle progression at the S phase in HCC cells. RRE increased the expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) by reducing the methylation status of the PTEN gene promoter and inhibiting DNMT1 expression and regulated AKT signaling pathway. These findings show that red raspberry phytochemicals inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells by regulating PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, providing evidence that RRE may be used as a potential auxiliary therapy for patients with HCC.",

    "abstract": "Aqueous colloidal suspensions, both man-made and natural, are part of our everyday life. The applicability of colloidal suspensions, however, is limited by the range of conditions over which they are stable. Here we report a novel type of highly monodisperse raspberry-like colloids, which are prepared in a single-step synthesis that relies on simultaneous dispersion and emulsion polymerisation. The resulting raspberry colloids behave almost like hard spheres. In aqueous solutions, such prepared raspberries show unexpected stability against aggregation over large variations of added salt concentrations without addition of stabilisers. We present simple Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) calculations performed on raspberry-like and smooth colloids showing that this stability results from our raspberries' unique morphology, which extends our understanding of colloidal stability against salting. Further, the raspberries' stability facilitates the formation of superspheres and thin films in which the raspberry colloids self-assemble into hexagonally close-packed photonic crystals with exquisite reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Candida spp., especially Candida albicans, is one of the main colonisers of the oral cavity. Due to its ability to form biofilms, it can be implicated in dental caries, periodontal disease and denture stomatitis. Microbial cells in biofilms are minimally impacted by conventional drugs. The aim of this study was to find new substances able to inhibit the adhesion of Candida spp. in order to prevent biofilm formation in the oral cavity. This study focused on the red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) fruit, known for its richness in potentially antimicrobial tannins. Extraction with a polarity gradient was performed on acetone extracts from frozen ripe and unripe fruits, resulting in eight extracts. The antifungal and anti-adhesion effects of the extracts were determined using broth microdilution and XTT methods, respectively, against C. albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis strains. Interestingly, four extracts (hexane and ethyl acetate) displayed anti-adhesion activity against C. albicans at low concentrations [50% inhibitory concentration (IC",

    "abstract": "A three-dimensional magnetic hollow porous raspberry-like hierarchical Co/Ni@carbon microspheres (3D Co/Ni@carbon) were synthesized by using a bimetal-organic framework (Co/Ni-MOF) as a precursor and subsequent calcination under nitrogen. The 3D Co/Ni@carbon is a novel solid phase extractant that displays outstanding extraction capability and separation efficiency for the pyrethroid pesticides ethofenprox and bifenthrin. This is ascribed to the beneficial effects of facile analyte transport (due to the presence of free pores), the abundant number of adsorption sites (which warrant efficient extraction), and the excellent structural stability of the material. The 3D Co/Ni@carbon was applied to dispersive magnetic solid-phase extraction (d-MSPE), and the two pyrethroids were quantified by HPLC (UV detection wavelength: 220\u00a0nm). The method has a high preconcentration factor (937-1012) and give recoveries that range between 85.6-106.9%, with RSDs (for n\u2009=\u20095) of <6% in case of real samples.

Thus, complex three-dimensional nanostructures with high stability are of considerable interest.

    "abstract": "Unlike many other rosaceous fruit crops, commercial raspberry cultivars are largely self-fertile and mostly self-pollinate autogamously. However, their floral morphology does not allow for complete autopollination, which often yields unmarketable small or crumbly fruits. Insect visitation is therefore essential to maximize raspberry production. Honey bees are typically used to pollinate commercial raspberries, but escalating prices for hive rentals coupled with increasing acreage encourages evaluation of other manageable pollinators. Four other manageable bee taxa-various Bombus spp., Osmia lignaria Say, Osmia aglaia Sandhouse, and Osmia bruneri Cockerell-are all promising raspberry pollinators. Because honey bees remain the least expensive option on a per forager basis, adoption of an alternative pollinator should entail some other advantage, such as superior pollination efficacy. In this study, we compared honey bees with these other bee species for their pollination efficacies at red raspberries, measured as the number of drupelets resulting from a single visit to a virgin flower. Each species' single-visit pollination efficacy was also compared with drupelet set from both unvisited and hand-pollinated flowers, and their pollination effectiveness scores were calculated. All five bee species were equally effective raspberry pollinators; therefore, honey bees remain the most cost effective option for open field pollination of raspberry. Mason bees and bumble bees may have greater utility during cool weather or for protected cultivation systems, contexts unfavorable to honey bee foraging.",

    "abstract": "The changing climate is altering timing of key fruit ripening processes and increasing the occurrence of fruit defects. To improve our understanding of the genetic control of raspberry fruit development an enhanced genetic linkage map was developed and used to examine ripening phenotypic data.\nIn this study we developed an enhanced genetic linkage map for the raspberry cvs. Glen Moy x Latham reference mapping population using genotyping by sequencing (GbS). Alignment to a newly sequenced draft reference genome of red raspberry, cultivar (cv.) Glen Moy, identified 8019 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). After stringent filtering to take account of read coverage over all the progeny individuals, association with a single chromosome, heterozygosity and marker regression mapping, 2348 high confidence SNPs were retained and integrated with an existing raspberry genetic map. The linkage map contained many more SNPs segregating in Latham than in Glen Moy. This caused difficulties in quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping with standard software and a novel analysis based on a hidden Markov model was used to improve the mapping. QTL mapping using the newly generated dense genetic map not only corroborated previously identified genetic locations but also provided additional genetic elements controlling fruit ripening in raspberry.\nThe high-density GbS map located the QTL peaks more precisely than in earlier studies, aligned the QTLs with Glen Moy genome scaffolds, narrowed the range of potential candidate genes to these regions that can be utilised in other populations or in gene expression studies to confirm their role and increased the repertoire of markers available to understand the genetic control of fruit ripening traits.",

    "abstract": "The fragmented nature of most draft plant genomes has hindered downstream gene discovery, trait mapping for breeding, and other functional genomics applications. There is a pressing need to improve or finish draft plant genome assemblies.\nHere, we present a chromosome-scale assembly of the black raspberry genome using single-molecule real-time Pacific Biosciences sequencing and high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) genome scaffolding. The updated V3 assembly has a contig N50 of 5.1 Mb, representing an \u223c200-fold improvement over the previous Illumina-based version. Each of the 235 contigs was anchored and oriented into seven chromosomes, correcting several major misassemblies. Black raspberry V3 contains 47 Mb of new sequences including large pericentromeric regions and thousands of previously unannotated protein-coding genes. Among the new genes are hundreds of expanded tandem gene arrays that were collapsed in the Illumina-based assembly. Detailed comparative genomics with the high-quality V4 woodland strawberry genome (Fragaria vesca) revealed near-perfect 1:1 synteny with dramatic divergence in tandem gene array composition. Lineage-specific tandem gene arrays in black raspberry are related to agronomic traits such as disease resistance and secondary metabolite biosynthesis.\nThe improved resolution of tandem gene arrays highlights the need to reassemble these highly complex and biologically important regions in draft plant genomes. The updated, high-quality black raspberry reference genome will be useful for comparative genomics across the horticulturally important Rosaceae family and enable the development of marker assisted breeding in Rubus.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory potential of crude extracts (CE), anthocyanin-rich fractions (ARF), and phenolic fractions (PF) from raspberry (R) and raspberry juice (J) were evaluated. The antioxidant properties were evaluated with three complementary assays: DPPH radical scavenging activity, chelating Fe(II) power, and ferric reducing power. The highest antioxidant activity was determined for the crude extract from raspberry pulp (RCE) in the case of all methods used. The anti-inflammatory activity was demonstrated by inhibitory effect on lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity in vitro. The highest efficiency in inhibiting the activity of both enzymes was exhibited by RCE, 0.79 and 0.59 mg FW/mL, respectively. In turn, JARF had the lowest ability to inhibit LOX (EC50 = 4.5 mg FW/mL) and JPF caused the lowest COX-2 inhibition (1.75 mg FW/mL). Additionally, we have performed a pilot study of in vitro cytotoxic activity using two human leukemia cell lines: J45 and HL60. All examined extracts inhibited the viability of J45 cells more effectively than HL60. The highest cytotoxic effect was observed in the J45.01 cell line after exposure to RCE (EC50 = 0.0375 mg FW/mL).",

    "abstract": "Pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest black raspberries (BRBs) may inhibit the development of oral cancer. Lyophilized BRB powder is commonly used in these studies, but processed BRB products are more often consumed. The objective of this work was to understand how storage conditions influence the phytochemical profile and anti-proliferative activity of a BRB nectar beverage. Untargeted UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS based metabolomics analyses demonstrated that large chemical variation was introduced by storage above -20 \u00b0C over 60 days. However, minimal change in anti-proliferative activity was observed when stored nectar extracts were applied to SCC-83-01-82 premalignant oral epithelial cells. As proof of concept, cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside and its degradation product, protocatechuic acid, were administered in different ratios maintaining an equimolar dose, and anti-proliferative activity was maintained. This study shows the utility of metabolomics to profile global chemical changes in foods, while demonstrating that isolated phytochemicals do not explain the complete bioactivity of a complex food product.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effect of \u03b1-linolenic acid-rich black raspberry seed (BRS) oil on lipid metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese and db/db mice. Five-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed diets consisting of 50% calories from lard, 5% from soybean, and 5% from corn oil (HFD), or 50% calories from lard and 10% from BRS oil (HFD + BRS oil diet) for 12 weeks. Six-week-old C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were fed diets consisting of 16% calories from soybean oil (standard diet), 8% from soybean, and 8% from BRS oil, or 16% from BRS oil for 10 weeks. The BRS oil diets lowered the levels of triacylglycerol, nonesterified fatty acids, and total cholesterol in serum and liver of both of the obese and db/db mice as compared with the HFD and standard diet, respectively. mRNA levels of lipogenesis markers including cluster of differentiation 36, fatty-acid-binding protein 1, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c, fatty-acid synthase, and solute carrier family 25 member 1 in the liver of the BRS oil groups were lower than those in the liver of the HFD and standard groups in the obese and db/db mice, respectively. On the other hand, fatty-acid oxidation markers including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, hydroxylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase \u03b1, and acyl-CoA oxidase in the liver of the BRS oil groups were higher than those in the liver of the HFD and standard groups in the obese and db/db mice, respectively. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 mRNA and protein levels increased in the liver and epididymal adipose tissue of the obese and db/db mice fed BRS oil compared with HFD and standard diet, respectively. BRS oil might improve lipid metabolism by inhibiting lipogenesis and promoting fatty-acid oxidation in HFD-induced obese and db/db mice.",

    "abstract": "Impedance Cardiography (ICG) is a non-invasive method for monitoring cardiac dynamics using Electrical Bioimpedance (EBI) measurements. Since its appearance more than 40 years ago, ICG has been used for assessing hemodynamic parameters. This paper present a measurement system based on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing both a full 3-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a platform supporting Do-It-Yourself project and education applications across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933. The recording were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC, where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely available and affordable components, for supporting developers in research and engineering education. The design and development documents, will be available on www.BiosignalPI.com, for open access under a Non Commercial-Share A like 4.0 International License.",

    "abstract": "We created an auto-para viewer, an autofluorescence imaging device, to localize the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy using an inexpensive Raspberry Pi. A special emission filter in the auto-para viewer was designed to pass 1/100 of visible light and nearly all infrared light longer than 808 nm. With this emission filter, we simultaneously acquired an autofluorescence image of the parathyroid and a visible light image of the surrounding surgical field. The auto-para viewer displayed four times brighter autofluorescence of the parathyroid glands compared to the background tissues without operating room light. Additionally, it showed two times brighter autofluorescence than the background tissues simultaneously showing the surgical field illuminated by the visible light from the operating room light. The NOIR camera, using the auto-para viewer, could reduce the camera's exposure time so the parathyroid glands to be viewed in real-time, which is expected to prevent unintentional damage to the parathyroid gland during thyroidectomy.",

    "abstract": "Chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes photo-oxidation, which in turn results in the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and loss of collagen. Rubus idaeus L. (RI), also called red raspberry, is an important cash crop that contains abundant antioxidant compounds. Sanguiin H-6 and lambertianin C are the major ingredients presented in the extracts. Here, we studied the protective effect of RI on UVB-induced photoaging in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). We found that RI notably reduced UVB-induced MMPs secretion and pro-inflammatory mediators production, and significantly suppressed UVB-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-\u03ba\u03b2, as well as activator protein 1. Additionally, treatment of NHDFs with the ERK inhibitor (PD98059) and JNK inhibitor (SP600125) resulted in the reduction of UVB-induced MMP-1 and IL-6 expressions, which demonstrated that the inhibition of MMP-1 and IL-6 by RI is associated with the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, we also found that RI accelerated procollagen type I synthesis by activating the transforming growth factor-\u03b2/Smad pathway and enhanced the expression of cytoprotective antioxidants such as heme oxygenase-1 and NHD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 by promoting nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 nuclear transfer. Overall, these findings demonstrated that RI was potentially effective in preventing UVB induced skin photoaging.",

    "abstract": "The elaborate design of calcium phosphates (CaP) with a hierarchical structure for biomedical applications is severely restricted due to their instinctive pertinacious irregular agglomeration. Thus, the development of mesoporous CaP with large internal pores is far from satisfactory. In this study, catechol is selected as a modifier to intervene in the precipitation of CaP. Compared to pure CaP with smooth irregular aggregates with an average size of 110 nm, the catechol-intervened CaP (CaP/Cat) samples are raspberry-like nano-spherical assemblies of ca. 25 nm nanoparticles. The obtained spheres possess a mesoporous structure, large interior pores and high specific surface area, which endow them with a high protein adsorption capacity and high DNA delivery efficacy. Catechol is subjected to oxidative polymerization while CaP precipitation occurs. This simultaneous reaction is supposed to play a crucial role in directing the assembling of the CaP/Cat nanospheres. The flexible catechol moiety is shown to be a novel and promising modifier for manufacturing CaP with tunable structures and properties for various applications.",

    "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis causes recurring intestinal mucosal injury and sustained inflammation, increasing the likelihood of colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Dietary red raspberry (RB) is a rich source of phytonutrients known to have anti-inflammatory activity; however, the role of RB on CRC prevention in chronic colitis has not been examined.\nThis study examined the effects of dietary RB supplementation on inflammation, epithelium repair, and oncogenic signaling in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis in mice.\nSix-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control or RB (5% of dry feed weight; n\u00a0=\u00a012/group) diet for 10 wk. Starting from the fourth week, mice were administered 2 repeated cycles of 1% DSS (7-d DSS treatment plus 14-d recovery) and were monitored daily for disease activity index (DAI) score. Colonic tissues were collected at the end of the study for histochemical, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analysis of inflammation, differentiation and proliferation markers.\nRB supplementation reduced the DAI score and histologic damage (by 38.9%; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01), expression of inflammatory mediators (by 20-70%; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01), infiltration of CD4 T cells (by 50%; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05), and \u03b14\u03b27 integrin and related adhesion molecules (by 33.3%; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01). Furthermore, RB supplementation facilitated epithelium repair, as evidenced by enhanced goblet cell density, expression of transcription factors including Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) and Hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes1), terminal differentiation markers, mucin 2 (Muc2), and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (by 20-200%; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01). Conversely, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (by 70%; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01), \u03b2-catenin, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling (by 19-33%; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) were reduced by RB supplementation. In addition, RB supplementation enhanced p53 stability (by 53%) and reduced oncogenic gene expression (by 50-60%).\nRB supplementation reduced DAI score and the risk of CRC development during recurring colitis in mice, suggesting that RB is a possible dietary supplement for patients with ulcerative colitis and related gut inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "The males of different species of Bactrocera and Zeugodacus fruit flies are commonly attracted to plant-derived phenylpropanoids (e.g. methyl eugenol (ME)) or phenylbutanoids (e.g. raspberry ketone (RK)) but almost never to both. However, one particular plant-derived phenylbutanoid, zingerone (ZN), which possesses an intermediate chemical structure between ME and RK, weakly attracts both ME- and RK-responding fruit fly species. Bactrocera jarvisi, an Australian fruit fly species, is weakly attracted to cue lure (an analogue of RK) but strongly attracted to ZN. Here, we investigated the minimum olfactory threshold and optimum sensitivity of B. jarvisi males to ZN and RK as a function of dose, time and sexual maturation. Our results show that B. jarvisi males had a marked preferential response to ZN, with a much lower olfactory threshold and faster response time to ZN than RK. Probit analysis demonstrated that ZN was at least >1600\u00d7 more potent than RK as a male attractant to B. jarvisi. Although fruit fly male attraction to the phytochemicals is generally associated with sexual maturity, in B. jarvisi immature males were also attracted to ZN. Our results suggest that B. jarvisi males have a fine-tuned olfactory response to ZN, which appears to play a central role in the chemical ecology of this species.",

    "abstract": "Botrytis cinerea, causal agent of gray mold, is one of the most important pathogens affecting raspberry in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and worldwide. Fungicides are currently applied to control the disease starting from 5 to 10% bloom and continuing on a calendar basis throughout the season rather than according to inoculum level or infection risk primarily because the disease cycle on red raspberry is poorly understood. Botrytis cinerea was isolated from raspberry flowers and fruit sampled at seven developmental stages during each of 2015 and 2016 in a northwestern Washington raspberry field untreated with fungicides. Incidence of colonization of flowers was low (15% of total sampled flowers), but increased as fruit developed, and peaked in mature fruit (67% of total sampled fruit). In the early stages of flower development, B. cinerea recovery was greatest from the carpel (80% of carpels colonized) compared with other floral organs. As fruit matured, additional floral parts were colonized by B. cinerea, possibly facilitating secondary internal or external infections of mature fruit. Average weekly minimum air temperature, average weekly night air temperature, cumulative rain, average weekly leaf wetness percentage, and duration of leaf wetness >90% were significantly positively correlated with B. cinerea colonization of raspberry in NW Washington during two seasons of this study. Our data does not support the hypothesis that the bloom period is the critical window for B. cinerea colonization of red raspberry and suggest that later colonization of developing fruit may be more important for gray mold development on raspberry. The outcomes of this research provide useful information for improvement of gray mold disease management strategies for red raspberry in NW Washington and elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "Raspberries are a rich source of ellagitannins and anthocyanins. The aim of this work was to investigate whether raspberry consumption can improve vascular function and to understand which phenolic metabolites may be responsible for the effects. A 3 arm double-blind randomized controlled crossover human intervention trial was conducted in 10 healthy males. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured at baseline, 2\u202fh, and 24\u202fh post-consumption of 200\u202fg and 400\u202fg of red raspberries containing 201 or 403\u202fmg of total (poly)phenols, or a matched control drink. Raspberry (poly)phenol metabolites were analyzed in plasma and urine by UPLC-QTOF mass spectrometry using authentic standards. Significant improvements in FMD were observed at 2\u202fh (1.6% (95%CI 1.2, 1.9) and 1.2% (95% CI 0.8, 1.5)) and 24\u202fh (1.0% (95% CI 0.6, 1.2) and 0.7% (95%CI 0.2, 0.9)) post-consumption of the 200 and 400\u202fg raspberry drinks as compared to control, respectively. Plasma ellagic acid, urolithin A-3-glucuronide and urolithin A-sulfate correlated with the improvements in FMD at 2 and 24\u202fh post consumption, respectively. Consumption of dietary achievable amounts of red raspberries acutely improves endothelial function up to 24\u202fh and ellagitannins may be responsible for the observed effect.",

    "abstract": "Obesity constitutes a major worldwide problem in which hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance represents adverse metabolic consequences of it. The present study was conducted to elucidate the role of raspberry ketones (RKs) in controlling body weight gain, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance in male obese rats through affecting the expression of various adipocytokines. As Aquaporin-7 is co-related with the expression of various adipocytokines and has recently emerged as a modulator of adipocyte metabolism, the present study evaluated the effect of RKs on adipose tissue expression of aquaporin-7(AQP7) in high-fat (HF) diet-fed rats. Groups of male rats were assigned to normal, HF diet-fed control rats and RKs-treated (250 and 500\u202fmg/kg) groups. RKs administration effectively abrogated hyperlipidemia and oxidative burden and enhanced insulin sensitivity. In addition, treatment with RKs ameliorated adipose tissue and liver indices and the reduced adipocyte diameters. Moreover, administration of the low dose of RKs ameliorated the expression of apelin and its receptor, and visfatin with upregulating adiponectin expression compared to HF diet control rats. However, both doses effectively downregulated leptin expression. It was obvious that both RKs doses revealed effectiveness in upregulating the AQP7 expression. The present data suggest the promising therapeutic role of RKs in HF diet-induced obesity that is likely attributable, at least in part, to upregulation of AQP7 expression.",

    "abstract": "Mesoporous materials with hierarchical morphologies have recently gained attention due to their structural versatility for various applications including catalysis, adsorption, energy storage and nanomedicine. However, it is still desirable for facilely controllable synthesis of mesoporous particles with tunable surface properties and oriented hierarchical structures. Here, we report a one-pot synthesis method for raspberry-like mesoporous silica nanospheres with 2 nm hollow silica nanoparticles doped on the surface. We identify that the control over the concentration of cationic surfactant and silica precursor can be used to control the multiple morphological evolutions of mesoporous silica nanoparticles. This control enables the fabrication of a diverse library of multi-compartment mesoporous silicas networks consist of mesoporous silica nanospheres connecting with mesoporous silica branches. The synthesis method would enable to synthesize hierarchical mesoporous silicas with complex architecture and different pore environments for the potential application in catalysis and nanomedicine.",

    "abstract": "Image-based phenomics is a powerful approach to capture and quantify plant diversity. However, commercial platforms that make consistent image acquisition easy are often cost-prohibitive. To make high-throughput phenotyping methods more accessible, low-cost microcomputers and cameras can be used to acquire plant image data.\nWe used low-cost Raspberry Pi computers and cameras to manage and capture plant image data. Detailed here are three different applications of Raspberry Pi-controlled imaging platforms for seed and shoot imaging. Images obtained from each platform were suitable for extracting quantifiable plant traits (e.g., shape, area, height, color) en masse using open-source image processing software such as PlantCV.\nThis protocol describes three low-cost platforms for image acquisition that are useful for quantifying plant diversity. When coupled with open-source image processing tools, these imaging platforms provide viable low-cost solutions for incorporating high-throughput phenomics into a wide range of research programs.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we prepared a novel composite based on hybrid gelatin carriers and montmorillonite clay (MMT) to analyze its viability as controlled drug delivery system. The objective of this research involves the characterization of composites formed by structured lipid-gelatin micro-particles (MP) and MMT clay. This analysis included the evaluation of the composite according to its rheological properties, morphology (SEM), particle size, XRD, FT-IR, and in vitro drug release. The effect of pH in the properties of the composite is evaluated. A novel raspberry-like or armor MP/MMT clay composite is reported, in which the pH has an important effect on the final structure of the composite for ad-hoc drug delivery systems. For pH values below the isoelectric point, we obtained defined morphologies with entrapment efficiencies up to 67%. The pH level controls the MP/MMT composite release mechanism, restringing drug release in the stomach-like environment. Intended for oral administration, these results evidence that the MP/MMT composite represents an attractive alternative for intestinal-colonic controlled drug delivery systems.",

    "abstract": "Spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae), is an invasive pest of soft-skinned fruits across the globe. Effective monitoring is necessary to manage this pest, but suitable attractants are still being identified. In this study, we combined lures with fermenting liquid baits to improve D. suzukii trapping specificity and attractiveness. We also measured the efficiency and specificity of baits/lures during different times of the season; the reproductive status of females among baits/lures; and the effects of locations and crop type on these response variables. We developed a metric that combined mating status and fat content to determine differences in types of females attracted. Lures utilizing yeast and sugar-based volatiles trapped the most D. suzukii. The addition of a commercial lure to yeast and sugar-based lures increased catches in most locations, but was also the least specific to D. suzukii. Apple juice-based chemical lures tended to be most specific to D. suzukii, while lures comprised of a singular attractant tended to trap more D. suzukii with a higher reproductive potential than combinations of attractants. Trap catch and lure specificity was lower during fruit development than fruit ripening. While catch amounts varied by geographic location and crop type, attractants performed similarly relative to each other in each location and crop. Based on the metrics in this study, the yeast and sugar-based attractants were the most effective lures. However, further work is needed to improve early season monitoring, elucidate the effects of physiological status on bait attraction, and understand how abiotic factors influence bait attraction.",

    "abstract": "Evidence indicates that raspberries have beneficial effects on chronic diseases. The objective of this study was to examine the beneficial effects of raspberry anthocyanin (RA) on high fat diet-induced obesity and investigate the underlying molecular mechanism. C57BL/6 mice were administered a low-fat diet, high-fat diet, and high-fat diet supplemented with RA at a dose of 200 mg kg-1 of food for 12 weeks. It was found that RA reduced the body weight gain by 63.7%. Furthermore, RA significantly elevated serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activities and fecal butyric acid level, remarkably reduced the serum and hepatic lipid profiles, and markedly down-regulated the expression of the tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) genes. Metabolomics analysis conducted using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) indicated that RA administration promoted the recovery of metabolites involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway, and glutathione metabolism in the livers of obese mice. These findings suggest that RA may ameliorate diet-induced obesity by alleviating oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Globally, agriculture increasingly depends on pollinators to produce many seed and fruit crops. However, what constitutes optimal pollination service for pollinator-dependent crops remains unanswered. We developed a simulation model to identify the optimal pollination service that maximizes fruit quality in crops. The model depicts the pollination (i.e., autonomous self-fertilization, pollen deposition) and post-pollination (i.e., pollen germination, and time from germination to ovule fertilization) processes leading to fruit and seed set and allows for negative flower-pollinator interactions, specifically pistil damage. We parameterized and validated the model based on empirical observations of commercial raspberry in western Argentina. To assess the effects of pollination intensity for fruit production, we conducted simulations over a range of visit number per flower by the two primary managed pollinators worldwide, Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris. Simulations identified that ~15-35 visits per flower by A.\u00a0mellifera or ~10-20 visits by B.\u00a0terrestris provide adequate pollination and maximize raspberry fruit quality (i.e., estimated as the proportion of ovules that develop into drupelets). Visits in excess of these optima reduce simulated fruit quality, and flowers receiving >670 honey bee visits or >470 bumble bee visits would produce fruits of poorer quality than those receiving no bee visits. The simulations generated consistent, unbiased predictions of fruit quality for 12 raspberry fields. This model could be adapted easily to other animal-pollinated crops and used to guide efficient pollinator management in any agro-ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberry extract (BRE) has been widely used for treating prostate and urinary diseases and hyperlipidemia in Asia due to its significant lipid-lowering effects. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the antihypercholesterolemia activity of BRE and the potential molecular mechanisms responsible for its antihypercholesterolemia activity by regulation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) expression in the human liver cell line HepG2. Reporter-based functional assay was used to identify herbal extracts that suppress PCSK9 expression in the HepG2 cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate whether BRE modulates low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression by repressing the hepatic expression of PCSK9. The LDLR activity of the HepG2 cells was determined using an LDL uptake assay. Our finding revealed that BRE modulates LDLR expression by suppressing the hepatic expression of PCSK9. We found that the combination of simvastatin and BRE caused the synergic induction of LDLR expression and LDL-C uptake, whereas simvastatin alone increased the expression of PCSK9 in the HepG2 cells. These results clearly demonstrated that the BRE from black raspberry suppressed simvastatin-induced PCSK9 expression and improved LDL-C uptake by hepatocytes through the induction of LDLR expression. These results suggest that the suppression of PCSK9 expression by BRE may potentiate the hypolipidemic effect of statins.",

    "abstract": "Supported catalysts are widely used in industry and can be optimized by tuning the composition, chemical structure, and interface of the nanoparticle catalyst and oxide support. Here we firstly combine a bottom up colloidal synthesis method with a top down atomic layer deposition (ALD) process to achieve a raspberry-like Pt-decorated Fe3O4 (Fe3O4-Pt) nanoparticle superlattices. This nanocomposite ensures the precision of the catalyst/support interface, improving the catalytic efficiency of the Fe3O4-Pt nanocomposite system. The morphology of the hybrid nanocomposites resulting from different cycles of ALD was monitored by scanning transmission electron microscopy, giving insight into the nucleation and growth mechanism of the ALD process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies confirm the anticipated electron transfer from Fe3O4 to Pt through the nanocomposite interface. Photocurrent measurement further suggests that Fe3O4 superlattices with controlled decoration of Pt have substantial promise for energy-efficient photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. This work opens a new avenue for designing supported catalyst architectures via precisely controlled decoration of single component superlattices with noble metals.",

Our previous study suggests that dietary raspberry can ameliorate metabolic syndromes in diet-induced obese mice. Here, we further evaluated the effects of raspberry on energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis and determined whether these effects were mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Mice deficient in the catalytic subunit of AMPK\u03b11 and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD supplemented with 5% raspberry (RAS) for 10 weeks. The thermogenic program and related regulatory factors in adipose tissue were assessed. RAS improved the insulin sensitivity and reduced fat mass in WT mice but not in AMPK\u03b11",

    "abstract": "Promoting white adipose tissue (WAT) to acquire brown-like characteristics is a promising approach for obesity treatment. Although raspberry ketone (RK) has been reported to possess antiobesity activity, its effects on the formation of brown-like adipocytes remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of RK on WAT browning in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and rats with ovariectomy (Ovx)-induced obesity. RK (100 \u03bcM) significantly induced browning of 3T3-L1 cells by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and the expression of browning-specific proteins (PR domain containing 16, PRDM16; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, PGC-1\u03b1; uncoupling protein-1, UCP-1) and lipolytic enzymes (hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase). RK significantly reduced the expression of the autophagy-related protein Atg12 and increased the expression of p62 and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). Additionally, these effects of RK were reversed by the HO-1 inhibitor SnPP (20 \u03bcM). In addition, RK (160 mg/kg, gavage, for 8 weeks) significantly reduced body weight gain (Ovx+RK, 191.8 \u00b1 4.6 g vs. Ovx, 223.6 \u00b1 5.9; P < .05), food intake, the amount of inguinal adipose tissue (Ovx+RK, 9.05 \u00b1 1.1 g vs Ovx, 12.9 \u00b1 0.92 g; P < .05) and the size of white adipocytes in Ovx rats. Moreover, compared to expression in the Ovx group, the levels of browning-specific proteins were significantly higher and the levels of autophagy-related proteins were significantly lower in the Ovx+RK group. Therefore, this study elucidated the mechanism associated with RK-induced WAT browning and thus provides evidence to support the clinical use of RK for obesity treatment.",

This platform for cognitive assessment in animals is comparable to human neuropsychological tests such as those employed by the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, and thus has several advantages compared to the standard maze apparatuses typically employed in rodent behavioral testing, such as the Morris water maze. These include improved translation of preclinical models, as well as high throughput and the automation of animal testing. However, these systems are relatively expensive, which can impede progress for researchers with limited resources.

    "abstract": "Inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase is directly associated with treatment of type 2 diabetes. In this regard, we conducted enzyme kinetics integrated with computational docking simulation to assess the inhibitory effect of raspberry ketone (RK) on \u03b1-glucosidase. RK bound to the active site of \u03b1-glucosidase and interacted with several key residues such as ASP68, TYR71, HIS111, PHE157, PHE158, PHE177, GLN181, ASP214, THR215, ASP349, ASP408, and ARG439, as detected by protein-ligand docking simulation. Subsequently, we confirmed the action of RK on \u03b1-glucosidase as the non-competitive type of inhibition in a reversible and rapidly binding manner. The relevant kinetic parameters were IC",

    "abstract": "Field studies were conducted to evaluate the transfer of active ingredients (AIs) of plant protection products (PPPs) to beehives. They were applied in two commodity red raspberry plantations of two varieties: Laszka (experiment 1) and Seedling (experiment 2). Samples of flowers, leaves, bees, brood, and honey were examined for the presence of chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, difenoconazole, cyprodinil, and trifloxystrobin (experiment 1) and chlorpyrifos, boscalid, pyraclostrobin, cypermethrin, difenoconazole, and azoxystrobin (experiment 2). In experiment 1, the highest levels of trifloxystrobin were observed on the surface of flowers, (0.04\u00a0\u03bcg/flower) and for difenoconazole on the inside (0.023\u00a0\u03bcg/flower). Leaves contained only trace residues of cypermethrin and cyprodinil (0.001\u00a0\u03bcg/cm",

    "abstract": "Glycation is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), where it potentiates the aggregation and toxicity of proteins such as \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2). Published studies support the anti-glycation and neuroprotective effects of several polyphenol-rich fruits, including berries, which are rich in anthocyanins. Herein, blackberry, black raspberry, blueberry, cranberry, red raspberry, and strawberry extracts were evaluated for: (1) total phenolic and anthocyanins contents, (2) free radical (DPPH) scavenging and reactive carbonyl species (methylglyoxal; MGO) trapping, (3) anti-glycation (using BSA-fructose and BSA-MGO models), (4) anti-A\u03b2 aggregation (using thermal- and MGO-induced fibrillation models), and, (5) murine microglia (BV-2) neuroprotective properties. Berry crude extracts (CE) were fractionated to yield anthocyanins-free (ACF) and anthocyanins-enriched (ACE) extracts. The berry ACEs (at 100 \u03bcg/mL) showed superior free radical scavenging, reactive carbonyl species trapping, and anti-glycation effects compared to their respective ACFs. The berry ACEs (at 100 \u03bcg/mL) inhibited both thermal- and MGO-induced A\u03b2 fibrillation. In addition, the berry ACEs (at 20 \u03bcg/mL) reduced H\u2082O\u2082-induced reactive oxygen species production, and lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide species in BV-2 microglia as well as decreased H\u2082O\u2082-induced cytotoxicity and caspase-3/7 activity in BV-2 microglia. The free radical scavenging, reactive carbonyl trapping, anti-glycation, anti-A\u03b2 fibrillation, and microglial neuroprotective effects of these berry extracts warrant further in vivo studies to evaluate their potential neuroprotective effects against AD.",

The post-processing signal is based on a Python algorithm that correlates the CL and secondary electron (SE) images with a precise dwell time correction. For CL imaging, the emission signal is collected through an optical fiber and transduced to an electrical signal via a photomultiplier tube (PMT). CL Images are registered in a panchromatic mode and can be filtered using a monochromator connected between the optical fiber and the PMT to produce monochromatic CL images. The designed system has been employed to study ZnO samples prepared by electrical arc discharge and microwave methods. CL images are compared with SE images and chemical elemental mapping images to correlate the emission regions of the sample.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose a simple shake-flask method to produce micron-size colloidosomes from a liquid-liquid interface functionalized with a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) film. A step-by-step extraction process of an organic phase partially miscible with water led to the formation of raspberry-like structures covered and protected by a gold nanofilm. The distinctive feature of the prepared colloidosomes is a very thin shell consisting of small AuNPs of 12 or 38 nm in diameter instead of several hundred nanometers reported previously. The interesting and remarkable property of the proposed approach is their reversibility: the colloidosomes may be easily transformed back to a nanofilm state simply by adding pure organic solvent. The obtained colloidosomes have a broadband absorbance spectrum, which makes them of great interest in applications such as photothermal therapy, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy studies, and microreactor vesicles for interfacial electrocatalysis.",

    "abstract": "Freeze-dried black raspberry (BRB) powder is considered as a potential cancer chemopreventive agent. In this study, we fed azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice with a diet containing BRB anthocyanins for 12 weeks, and this led to a reduction in colon carcinogenesis. These animals had consistently lower tumor multiplicity compared with AOM/DSS-treated mice not receiving BRB anthocyanins. In AOM/DSS-treated mice, the number of pathogenic bacteria, including Desulfovibrio sp. and Enterococcus spp., was increased significantly, whereas probiotics such as Eubacterium rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Lactobacillus were dramatically decreased, but BRB anthocyanins supplement could reverse this imbalance in gut microbiota. BRB anthocyanins also caused the demethylation of the SFRP2 gene promoter, resulting in increased expression of SFRP2, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, the expression levels of DNMT31 and DNMT3B, as well as of p-STAT3 were downregulated by BRB anthocyanins in these animals. Taken together, these results suggested that BRB anthocyanins could modulate the composition of gut commensal microbiota, and changes in inflammation and the methylation status of the SFRP2 gene may play a central role in the chemoprevention of CRC.",

    "abstract": "A sol-gel transformation of liquid silica precursor to solid silica particles was carried out in a one-pot synthesis way, where a solution of styrene butadiene elastomer was present. The composites, thus produced, offered remarkable improvements of mechanical and dynamic mechanical performances compared to precipitated silica. The morphological analysis reveals that the alkoxy-based silica particles resemble a raspberry structure when the synthesis of the silica was carried out in the presence of polymer molecules and represent a much more open silica-network structure. However, in the absence of the polymer, the morphology of the silica particles is found to be different. It is envisaged that the special morphology of the in situ synthesized silica particles contributes to the superior reinforcement effects, which are associated with a strong silica-rubber interaction by rubber chains trapped inside the raspberry-like silica aggregates. Therefore, the interfaces are characterized in detail by low-field solid-state ",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) contains a variety of polyphenols including anthocyanins and ellagitannins. Red raspberry polyphenols absorbed in different forms (parent compounds, degradants or microbial metabolites) are subject to xenobiotic metabolism in the intestine, liver, and/or kidney, forming methylate, glucuronide, and sulfate conjugated metabolites. Upon acute exposure, (poly)phenol/metabolite presence in the blood depends mainly on intestinal absorption, enterohepatic circulation, and metabolism by resident microbiota. However, chronic exposure to red raspberry polyphenols may alter metabolite patterns depending on adaptions in the xenobiotic machinery and/or microbiota composition. Understanding the metabolic fate of these compounds and their composition in different biological specimens relative to the exposure time/dose will aid in designing future health benefit studies, including the mechanism of action studies. The present exploratory study applied ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) and triple quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometries to characterize red raspberry polyphenols in fruit and then their appearance, including metabolites in human biological samples (plasma, urine and breast milk) after the chronic intake of red raspberries. The results suggested that the most abundant polyphenols in red raspberries included cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, sanguiin H6 and lambertianin C. Sixty-two (poly)phenolic compounds were tentatively identified in the plasma, urine and breast milk samples after the intake of red raspberries. In general, urine contained the highest content of phenolic metabolites; phase II metabolites, particularly sulfated conjugates, were mainly present in urine and breast milk, and breast milk contained fewer parent anthocyanins compared to urine and plasma.",

    "abstract": "Excessive lipid accumulation in white adipose tissue (WAT) leads to chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Raspberry (RB) contains high amount of polyphenols and dietary fibers. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of RB supplementation on WAT morphology, inflammation, and insulin signaling in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, and further explore the underlying mechanisms.\nC57BL/6J mice are fed with a control diet or a HFD supplemented with 0 or 5% freeze dried RB for 12 weeks. RB supplementation decreases WAT hypertrophy induced by HFD and suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and macrophage infiltration in WAT. Meanwhile, RB addition improves insulin sensitivity of HFD-mice. Additionally, RB supplementation drives the browning of WAT (beige adipogenesis), which is associated with elevated PGC-1\u03b1 and FNDC5/irisin contents. Consistently, the content of beige adipocyte markers including UCP1, PRDM16, Cytochrome C, Cidea, and Elvol3 is enhanced in HFD-mice, which are correlated with increased AMPK phosphorylation and Sirt1 protein contents.\nDietary RB attenuated adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation of WAT in HFD-mice and improves insulin sensitivity and beige adipogenesis, which is associated with increased FNDC5/irisin content and activation of AMPK/Sirt1 pathway. RB supplementation provides a promising strategy to prevent diet-induced obesity.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents surveys on residue levels of fungicides and insecticides applied according to the raspberry protection program. The field trials were conducted in 2013-2014 on a plantation of raspberry of the Laszka variety dessert raspberry very popular in Poland. Laboratory samples were collected starting from a day of the first fruit picking to the end of harvest. The highest mean residue levels were found for boscalid and pyraclostrobin (2.395\u00a0mg/kg and 0.732\u00a0mg/kg, respectively), in both cases they were at a level of about 24% of their maximum residue levels (MRLs); and for cypermethrin (0.235\u00a0mg/kg; i.e. close to 50% of its MRL). The long-term dietary intakes of those substances by Polish adult consumers were also at low levels of 0.52, 0.22, and 0.04% of acceptable daily intake (ADI), respectively. Therefore, the results obtained indicated that even on day zero of picking ripe raspberries, the pesticide residues not only were well below their corresponding MRLs, but also their daily intakes did not even approach 1% of the ADI. In 2013, pesticide residues in ripe fruit evolved according to a pattern different than in a subsequent year; while in 2014 they changed at a constant exponential rate.",

    "abstract": "Plant protection products (PPPs) have been found increasingly in the environment. They pose a huge threat to bees, contributing to honeybee colony losses and consequently to enormous economic losses. Therefore, this field investigation was designed to determine whether their active ingredients (AIs) were transferred from raspberry plants to beehives located in the immediate neighbourhood of the crop and to what extent they were transferred. Every week for 2\u00a0months, samples of soil, raspberry leaves, flowers and fruits, worker bees, honeybee brood, and honey were collected and analysed for the presence of propyzamide, chlorpyrifos, iprodione, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, cypermethrin, difenoconazole, azoxystrobin, and pyrimethanil residues. Five of these substances were found in the worker bee bodies. Chlorpyrifos, applied to only the soil through the irrigation system, also was detected in the brood. A small amount of boscalid was noted in the honey, but its residues did not exceed the maximum residue level. For chlorpyrifos, boscalid, and pyrimethanil, a positive correlation between the occurrence of PPPs in the crops and the beehives was found. Statistical methods confirmed that the application of PPPs on a raspberry plantation, as an example of nectar-secreting plants, was linked to the transfer of their AIs to beehives.",

    "abstract": "The cardioprotective role of raspberry ketone (RK) against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats was assessed.\nRats were randomly divided into Group I - Vehicle control; Group II - Toxic control ISO (85mg/kg, s.c.); Group III, IV and V - RK (50, 100 and 200mg/kg, respectively) with ISO; Group VI- RK (200mg/kg) alone; Group VII - Propranolol (10mg/kg) with ISO; and Group VIII - Propranolol (10mg/kg) alone. After twenty-four hours of the last dose, animals were sacrificed and creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density-lipoprotein, low-density-lipoprotein, very-low-density-lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, Na\nTreatment with ISO significantly deviated the biochemical parameters from the normal levels, which were considerably restored by RK at 100 and 200mg/kg doses. 50mg/kg dose, however, did not demonstrate any significant cardioprotective action. The histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis further substantiated these findings.\nOur study showed a dose-dependent reduction in oxidative stress, inflammation and dyslipidemia by RK in ISO-intoxicated rats, which signifies that RK from the European red raspberry plant might be a valuable entity for the management of MI.",

In this study, the anti-adipogenic effect of polyphenol-rich extract obtained from chokeberry Aronia melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliot, raspberry Rubus idaeus L., bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus L. and cranberry Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton fruits and its underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipose cells. Treatment with the extract (25-100 \u03bcg/mL) significantly decreased lipid accumulation and reactive oxygen species generation in adipocytes without showing cytotoxicity. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the extract at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/mL suppressed adipogenesis and lipogenesis via the down-regulation of PPAR\u03b3 (67%), C/EBP\u03b1 (72%), SREBP1 (62%), aP2 (24%), FAS (32%), LPL (40%), HSL (39%), and PLIN1 (32%) gene expression. Moreover, the extract significantly increased the expression of adiponectin (4.4-fold) and decreased leptin expression (90%) and respectively regulated the production of these adipokines in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The obtained results suggest that the analyzed extract may be a promising source of bioactive compounds that support long-term weight maintenance and promote the effective management of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Among older adults, falls are a leading cause of distress, pain, injury, loss of confidence, and ultimately, loss of independence and death. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that berry supplementation improves the age-related declines in balance, muscle strength, and coordination that often lead to falls, even when initiated later in life. The purpose of this study was to explore the interaction between baseline motor performance and the daily intake of raspberry required to improve/preserve motor function. Aged male F344 (17 mo) rats were tested for baseline (pre-test) balance, muscle strength, and coordination, and divided into good, average, and poor performers based on their motor composite score. Rats in each category were fed with either a control, 1%, or 2% raspberry-supplemented diet for 8 weeks and then retested (post-test). Poor performers fed with 1% or 2% raspberry had higher post-test composite scores (p < 0.05), while 2% raspberry lowered post-test composite scores in the good performers (p < 0.05), compared to control-fed rats. 1% and 2% raspberry appeared to preserve the performance of good performers and improve the performance of poor performers on plank walking (p < 0.05), while 2% raspberry improved post-test grip strength of the poor performers (p < 0.05). Additionally, rats with lower post-diet composite scores had higher levels of serum IL-1\u03b2 levels (r = -0.347, p < 0.05). These findings identified poor performers as being the most likely to benefit from daily consumption of \u00bd-2 cups of raspberry to improve/preserve motor function. Therefore, increased raspberry consumption may reduce fall risk, extend independence, and improve quality of life in the aging population.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the antiobesity effects of raspberry ketone (RK), one of the major aromatic compounds contained in raspberry, and its underlying mechanisms. During adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells, RK (300 \u03bcM) significantly reduced lipid accumulation and downregulated the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1), peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), and fatty acid synthase (FAS). RK also reduced the expression of light chain 3B (LC3B), autophagy-related protein 12 (Atg12), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and phosphorylated-tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), whereas it increased the level of p62 and phosphorylated-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Daily administration of RK decreased the body weight (ovariectomy [Ovx] + RK, 352.6 \u00b1 5 vs Ovx, 386 \u00b1 5.8 g; P < 0.05), fat mass (Ovx + RK, 3.2 \u00b1 0.05 vs Ovx, 5.0 \u00b1 0.4 g; P < 0.05), and fat cell size (Ovx + RK, 6.4 \u00b1 0.6 vs Ovx, 11.1 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 10",

    "abstract": "Plant science uses increasing amounts of phenotypic data to unravel the complex interactions between biological systems and their variable environments. Originally, phenotyping approaches were limited by manual, often destructive operations, causing large errors. Plant imaging emerged as a viable alternative allowing non-invasive and automated data acquisition. Several procedures based on image analysis were developed to monitor leaf growth as a major phenotyping target. However, in most proposals, a time-consuming parameterization of the analysis pipeline is required to handle variable conditions between images, particularly in the field due to unstable light and interferences with soil surface or weeds. To cope with these difficulties, we developed a low-cost, 2D imaging method, hereafter called PYM. The method is based on plant leaf ability to absorb blue light while reflecting infrared wavelengths. PYM consists of a Raspberry Pi computer equipped with an infrared camera and a blue filter and is associated with scripts that compute projected leaf area. This new method was tested on diverse species placed in contrasting conditions. Application to field conditions was evaluated on lettuces grown under photovoltaic panels. The objective was to look for possible acclimation of leaf expansion under photovoltaic panels to optimise the use of solar radiation per unit soil area.\nThe new PYM device proved to be efficient and accurate for screening leaf area of various species in wide ranges of environments. In the most challenging conditions that we tested, error on plant leaf area was reduced to 5% using PYM compared to 100% when using a recently published method. A high-throughput phenotyping cart, holding 6 chained PYM devices, was designed to capture up to 2000 pictures of field-grown lettuce plants in less than 2\u00a0h. Automated analysis of image stacks of individual plants over their growth cycles revealed unexpected differences in leaf expansion rate between lettuces rows depending on their position below or between the photovoltaic panels.\nThe imaging device described here has several benefits, such as affordability, low cost, reliability and flexibility for online analysis and storage. It should be easily appropriated and customized to meet the needs of various users.",

In the most challenging conditions that we tested, error on plant leaf area was reduced to 5% using PYM compared to 100% when using a recently published method. A high-throughput phenotyping cart, holding 6 chained PYM devices, was designed to capture up to 2000 pictures of field-grown lettuce plants in less than 2\u00a0h. Automated analysis of image stacks of individual plants over their growth cycles revealed unexpected differences in leaf expansion rate between lettuces rows depending on their position below or between the photovoltaic panels.",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging is a technology that can be used to monitor plant responses to stress. Hyperspectral images have a full spectrum for each pixel in the image, 400-2500\u00a0nm in this case, giving detailed information about the spectral reflectance of the plant. Although this technology has been used in laboratory-based controlled lighting conditions for early detection of plant disease, the transfer of such technology to imaging plants in field conditions presents a number of challenges. These include problems caused by varying light levels and difficulties of separating the target plant from its background. Here we present an automated method that has been developed to segment raspberry plants from the background using a selected spectral ratio combined with edge detection. Graph theory was used to minimise a cost function to detect the continuous boundary between uninteresting plants and the area of interest. The method includes automatic detection of a known reflectance tile which was kept constantly within the field of view for all image scans. A method to split images containing rows of multiple raspberry plants into individual plants was also developed. Validation was carried out by comparison of plant height and density measurements with manually scored values. A reasonable correlation was found between these manual scores and measurements taken from the images (r",

    "abstract": "Raspberry (Rubus spp.) is an economically important crop with a restricted growing season and very limited fruit shelf-life due to its extreme tenderness. In order to prolong its shelf life, an aqueous composition containing hexanal as the key active ingredient (HC) was applied as a preharvest spray during fruit development. The effects of HC were assessed using physiological, biochemical and anatomical parameters on the treated fruits and compared with the effects of mock inoculation which lacked hexanal. Sugars and acidity did not show a significant change in response to HC treatment, while the pulling force (the tension required to detach the berry from the receptacle) significantly improved in the HC-treated fruits, compared to control. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed a high correlation between the presence of rigid epidermal hairs and a stronger degree of attachment between berries and their receptacle in the HC treated fruits. Further, electron micrographs also showed abnormal crystalline depositions on the epidermal drupelets of the treated berries. Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis showed those crystals to be largely composed of calcium. HC treatment also resulted in the reduction of transcript level of three phospholipase D genes, as well as altered expression pattern of five members of the annexin gene family, and four calmodulin-binding transcription activators. Quantification of PLD activity showed that hexanal inhibited PLD activity in treated berries. The potential crosstalk between hexanal, phospholipase D activity and calcium and this crosstalk's role in delaying fruit softening and in prolonging storage life of fruits shelf life is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberries (BRB) have been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in a number of systems, with most studies focusing on progression. Previously we reported that an anthocyanin-enriched black raspberry extract (BE) enhanced repair of dibenzo-[a,l]-pyrene dihydrodiol (DBP-diol)-induced DNA adducts and inhibited DBP-diol and DBP-diolepoxide (DBPDE)-induced mutagenesis in a lacI rat oral fibroblast cell line, suggesting a role for BRB in the inhibition of initiation of carcinogenesis. Here we extend this work to protection by BE against DNA adduct formation induced by dibenzo-[a,l]-pyrene (DBP) in a human oral leukoplakia cell line (MSK) and to a second carcinogen, UV light. Treatment of MSK cells with DBP and DBPDE led to a dose-dependent increase in DBP-DNA adducts. Treatment of MSK cells with BE after addition of DBP reduced levels of adducts relative to cells treated with DBP alone, and treatment of rat oral fibroblasts with BE after addition of DBPDE inhibited mutagenesis. These observations showed that BE affected repair of DNA adducts and not metabolism of DBP. As a proof of principle we also tested aglycones of two anthocyanins commonly found in berries, delphinidin chloride and pelargonidin chloride. Delphinidin chloride reduced DBP-DNA adduct levels in MSK cells, while PGA did not. These results suggested that certain anthocyanins can enhance repair of bulky DNA adducts. As DBP and its metabolites induced formation of bulky DNA adducts, we investigated the effects of BE on genotoxic effects of a second carcinogen that induces bulky DNA damage, UV light. UV irradiation produced a dose-dependent increase in cyclobutanepyrimidine dimer levels in MSK cells, and post-UV treatment with BE resulted in lower cyclobutanepyrimidine dimer levels. Post-UV treatment of the rat lacI cells with BE reduced UV-induced mutagenesis.

Storage of raspberry juices and syrups also resulted in a reduction in antioxidant activity.\nThe enzymatic treatment of the raspberry mash generally increased the losses of anthocyanins. The addition of sugar to fruit juices only slightly reduced these losses.",

    "abstract": "Protein-polysaccharide interactions offer opportunities for designing the new functional foods with applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. In this work, we microencapsulated black raspberry water extracts by double emulsion technique prior to complex coacervation using gelatin and gum Arabic to diminish the instability of their anthocyanins (ANCs) as water soluble compounds, particularly under harsh processing and storage conditions. Subsequently, optical microscopy, moisture, hygroscopicity, solubility, particle size, loading capacity, zeta potential, color parameters (L*, a*, b*, C, H\u00b0 and TCD), stability, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermal behavior were evaluated. The microcapsules presented the lower moisture, hygroscopicity and solubility values as comparing the free form of ANCs. They showed the average sizes ranging from 35.34\u00b13.21 to 80.22\u00b15.21\u03bcm and high loading capacity (29.67\u00b10.66-38.54\u00b10.08%). According to the HPLC results, the selected method significantly increased the stability of ANCs up to 23.66% after 2 months of storage at 37\u00b12\u00b0C. FT-IR spectra confirmed the negative zeta potential values of microcapsules and the occurrence of coacervation process. DSC results evidenced the thermostability of microcapsules. Furthermore, the selected optimal microcapsules revealed intense red color over the time of storage, implying the effectiveness of the method chosen to preserve anthocyanins.",

    "abstract": "High tunnels are large protective structures used for season extension of many crops, including raspberries. These structures are often covered in plastic films to reduce and diffuse ultraviolet light transmission for pest and disease control, but this may also affect the photodegradation and efficacy of pesticides applied under these tunnels. We compared the residue levels of ten insecticides under three tunnel plastics with varying levels of UV transmission and open field conditions. Raspberry plants placed in research-scale tunnels were treated with insecticides and residues on fruit and foliage were monitored for one or two weeks in early 2015 and early and late 2016. Plastics that reduce UV transmission resulted in 50% greater residues of some insecticides compared to transparent plastics, and 60% compared to uncovered tunnels. This increased persistence of residues was evident within 1 day and remained consistently higher for up to 14 days. This pattern was demonstrated for multiple insecticides, including bifenthrin, esfenvalerate, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and spinosad. In contrast, the insecticide malathion degraded rapidly regardless of the plastic treatment, indicating less sensitivity to photodegradation. Bioassays using insecticide-treated leaves that were under UV-blocking plastic revealed higher mortality of the invasive fruit pest, Drosophila suzukii, compared to leaves that were uncovered. This indicates that the activity of pesticides under high tunnels covered in UV-reducing plastics may be prolonged, allowing for fewer insecticide applications and longer intervals between sprays. This information can be used to help optimize pest control in protected culture berry production.",

    "abstract": "The beneficial effects of consumption of berry fruits on a range of chronic diseases has been attributed (at least in part) to the presence of unique phytochemicals. Recently, we identified novel ursolic acid-based triterpenoid glycosides (TTPNs) in raspberry fruit and demonstrated their survival in human ileal fluids after feeding which confirmed their colon-availability in vivo. In this paper, in vitro digestion studies demonstrated that certain TTPNs were stable under gastrointestinal conditions and confirmed that these components may have been responsible for bioactivity noted in previous studies. Sequential extractions of raspberry puree, isolated seeds and unseeded puree showed that certain TTPN components (e.g. peak T1 m/z 679, and T2 m/z 1358) had different extractabilities in water/solvent mixes and were differentially associated with the seeds. Purified seed TTPNs (mainly T1 and T2) were shown to be anti-genotoxic in HT29 and CCD841 cell based in vitro colonocyte models. Further work confirmed that the seeds contained a wider range of TTPN-like components which were also differentially extractable in water/solvent mixes. This differential extractability could influence the TTPN composition and potential bioactivity of the extracts. There was considerable variation in total content of TTPNs (\u223c3-fold) and TTPN composition across 13 Rubus genotypes. Thus, TTPNs are likely to be present in raspberry juices and common extracts used for bioactivity studies and substantial variation exists in both content and composition due to genetics, tissue source or extraction conditions, which may all affect observed bioactivity.",

    "abstract": "Botrytis fruit rot (BFR), one of the most important diseases of raspberry (Rubus spp.), is controlled primarily with fungicides. Despite the use of fungicides, crop losses due to BFR are high in most years. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between airborne inoculum, weather variables, and BFR in order to improve the management of the disease as well as harvest and storage decisions. Crop losses, measured as the percentage of diseased berries during the harvest period, were monitored in unsprayed field plots at four sites in three successive years, together with meteorological data and the number of conidia in the air. Based on windowpane analysis, there was no evidence of correlation between crop losses and temperature, vapor pressure deficit, wind, solar radiation, or probability of infection. There were significant correlations between crop losses and airborne inoculum and between crop losses and humidity-related variables, and the best window length was identified as 7 days. Using 7-day average airborne inoculum concentration combined with 7-day average relative humidity for periods ending 6 to 8 days before bloom, it was possible to accurately predict crop losses (R",

    "abstract": "Rodent models of neurological disease such as stroke are often characterized by motor deficits. One of the tests that are used to assess these motor deficits is the tapered beam test, which provides a sensitive measure of bilateral motor function based on foot faults (slips) made by a rodent traversing a gradually narrowing beam. However, manual frame-by-frame scoring of video recordings is necessary to obtain test results, which is time-consuming and prone to human rater bias.\nWe present a cost-effective method for automated touch sensing in the tapered beam test. Capacitive touch sensors detect foot faults onto the beam through a layer of conductive paint, and results are processed and stored on a Raspberry Pi computer.\nAutomated touch sensing using this method achieved high sensitivity (96.2%) as compared to 'gold standard' manual video scoring. Furthermore, it provided a reliable measure of lateralized motor deficits in mice with unilateral photothrombotic stroke: results indicated an increased number of contralesional foot faults for up to 6days after ischemia.\nThe automated adaptation of the tapered beam test produces results immediately after each trial, without the need for labor-intensive post-hoc video scoring. It also increases objectivity of the data as it requires less experimenter involvement during analysis.\nAutomated touch sensing may provide a useful adaptation to the existing tapered beam test in mice, while the simplicity of the hardware lends itself to potential further adaptations to related behavioral tests.",

    "abstract": "Tephritid fruit flies are amongst the most damaging insect pests of horticulture globally. Some of the key fruit fly species are managed using the sterile insect technique (SIT), whereby millions of sterile males are released to suppress reproduction of pest populations. Male annihilation technique (MAT), whereby sex specific lures are used to attract and kill males, is often used to reduce wild male numbers before SIT programs commence, providing released sterile males an increased numerical advantage. Overall program efficacy might be improved if MAT could be deployed simultaneously with SIT, continuously depleting fertile males from pest populations and replacing them with sterile males. However, such 'male replacement' requires a means of suppressing attraction of released sterile males to lures used in MAT. Previous studies have found that exposure of some fruit flies to lure compounds as mature adults can suppress subsequent response to those lures, raising the possibility of pre-release treatments. However, this approach requires holding flies until after maturation for treatment and then release. The present study takes a novel approach of exposing immature adult male Queensland fruit flies (Bactrocera tryoni, or 'Qfly') to raspberry ketone (RK) mixed in food, forcing these flies to ingest RK at ages far younger than they would naturally. After feeding on RK-supplemented food for two days after emergence, male Qflies exhibited a reduction in attraction to cuelure traps that lasted more than 20 days. This approach to RK exposure is compatible with current practises, in which Qflies are released as immature adults, and also yields advantages of accelerated reproductive development and increased mating propensity at young ages.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila suzukii Matsumura is a serious pest of small fruits that lays its eggs in growing fruit. Current management strategies rely on an unsustainable schedule of foliar applications of chemical insecticides. Alternative approaches to suppressing oviposition are under investigation, such as attract-and-kill and the use of oviposition deterrents. Here, we evaluated two behavioral control approaches in combination as a push-pull strategy using laboratory and field assays.\nIn laboratory caged assays, both an attractive mass trapping device (pull) and an oviposition deterrent (push: 1-octen-3-ol) reduced oviposition by D. suzukii, and the combination of the two (push-pull) resulted in significantly greater reduction than either treatment alone. In field experiments, oviposition reduction was observed in fruit from plots treated with oviposition deterrent (push) or a combination of mass trapping devices and deterrent (push-pull) compared with fruit from control plots. However, oviposition in plots with mass trapping devices (pull) was higher than observed in all other treatments. Additionally, the protection provided by the deterrent in push plots extended to the entire plot rather than just in fruit closest to deterrent dispensers.\nPush-pull treatments negatively affected D. suzukii infestation in both laboratory and field experiments. The reduction in oviposition observed in laboratory experiments was based on the additive effect of push and pull components acting on a finite population, while the reduction observed in field experiments appeared to be mainly based on the effect of pull components. We discuss potential underlying reasons for the discrepancy results and suggest potential improvements. \u00a9 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "abstract": "Terpolymer raspberry vesicles contain domains of different chemical affinities. They are potential candidates as multi-compartment cargo carriers. Their efficacy depends on their stability and load capacity. Using a model star terpolymer system in an aqueous solution, a dissipative particle dynamic (DPD) simulation is employed to investigate how equilibrium aggregate structures are affected by polymer concentration and pairwise interaction energy in a solution. It is shown that a critical mass of polymer is necessary for vesicle formation. The free energy of the equilibrium aggregates are calculated and the results show that the transition from micelles to vesicles is governed by the interactions between the longest solvophobic block and the solvent. In addition, the ability of vesicles to encapsulate solvent is assessed. It is found that reducing the interaction energy favours solvent encapsulation, although solvent molecules can permeate through the vesicle's shell when repulsive interactions among monomers are low. Thus, one can optimize the loading capacity and the release rate of the vesicles by turning pairwise interaction energies of the polymer and the solvent. The ability to predict and control these aspects of the vesicles is an essential step towards designing vesicles for specific purposes.",

    "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX) is an antimetabolite drug commonly prescribed for the various cancers and autoimmune diseases. Despite its considerable therapeutic effects, nephrotoxicity is the most important side-effect of treatment with MTX. Aquaporin1 (AQP1) is a water channel proteins which is present in mammalian kidney. Raspberry fruit with antioxidant properties is able to protect biological systems from the harmful effects of free radicals. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of raspberry extract on expression of AQP1 and the MTX-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.\nIn this experimental study, 60 adult male Wistar rats were divided into nine groups including control, sham, MTX treated group [single dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight (BW) MTX at the third day], raspberry treated groups [intraperitoneal (I.P) injection of 100, 200, 400 mg/kg of BW raspberry extract for ten consecutive days], MTX and raspberry treated groups. At day 11, rats were sacrificed via chloroform inhalation and kidney tissues were fixed in formalin solution for histological and immunohistochemistry analysis. The serological assays for urea, creatinine, uric acid and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were also performed.\nMTX elevated serum level of the urea, creatinine, uric acid, IL-6, renal tissue damage and decreased the AQP1 expression level. Raspberry fruit extract improved the kidney function and reduced side effects of MTX in treated rats. Expression of AQP1, in a dose dependent manner was also ameliorated, as compared to control group.\nAccording to the findings of this study, it can be concluded that biological activity of compounds presented in raspberry fruit extract especially anthocyanins may have chemo-protective effect on kidney function and AQP1 expression in rats treated by MTX.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is caused by excessive accumulation of body fat and is closely related to complex metabolic diseases. Raspberry ketone (RK), a major aromatic compound in red raspberry, was recently reported to possess anti-obesity effects. However, its mechanisms are unclear.\nAdipogenesis plays a critical role in obesity and, therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanisms of action of RK on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.\n3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated in medium containing insulin, dexamethasone, and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. Adipocyte lipid contents were determined using oil-red O staining while adipogenic transcription factor and lipogenic protein expressions were determined using western blotting.\nRK (300-400\u00b5M) strongly inhibited lipid accumulation during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation into adipocytes. RK reduced the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-\u03b1 (C/EBP-\u03b1), peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) expressions and increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), Wnt10b, and \u03b2-catenin expressions in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Additionally, RK inhibited lipid accumulation, and adipogenic transcription factor and lipogenic protein expressions were all decreased by inhibiting HO-1 or \u03b2-catenin using tin protoporphyrin (SnPP) or \u03b2-catenin short-interfering RNA (siRNA), respectively. Furthermore, Wnt10b and \u03b2-catenin expressions were negatively regulation by SnPP.\nRK may exert anti-adipogenic effects through modulation of the HO-1/Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.",

ProCa increased while canes removal decreased chlorophylls and carotenoids content compared to control. POD, CAT, and PPO activities in leaves after removal of young canes were higher compared to control (2-4 times) which was visually confirmed for POD by isoelectrofocusing. Removal of young canes slithly increased, while ProCa significantly enhanced SOD activity in leaves compared to control (475.10 and 218.38 nkat mg",

    "abstract": "We report on the development of raspberry-like silica structures formed by the adsorption of 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (HPTS)@silica nanoparticles (NPs) on rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RBTIC)@silica NPs for ratiometric fluorescence-based pH sensing. To overcome the well-known problem of dye leaching which occurs during encapsulation of anionic HPTS dye in silica NPs, we utilized a polyelectrolyte-assisted incorporation of the anionic HPTS. The morphological and optical characterization of the as-synthesized dye-doped NPs and the resulting nanohybrids were carried out. The pH-sensitive dye, HPTS, incorporated in the HPTS-doped silica NPs provided a pH-dependent fluorescence response while the RBITC-doped silica provided the reference signal for ratiometric sensing. We evaluated the effectiveness of the nanohybrids for pH sensing; the ratio of the fluorescence emission intensity at 510\u2005nm and 583\u2005nm at excitation wavelengths of 454\u2005nm and 555\u2005nm, respectively. The results showed a dynamic response in the acidic pH range. With this approach, nanohybrids containing different dyes or receptors could be developed for multifunctioning and multiplexing applications.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis of polyaniline-silica composites has been reinvestigated in view of the opposing results found in the literature. Firstly, we synthesized silica particles with tunable size using the St\u00f6ber process. These silica particles have been fully characterized before being used as solid support for the polymerization of aniline. This polymerization was performed according to a published procedure where the pH of the reaction mixture was below the pKa of aniline but at a value where the silica particles surface was still slightly negatively charged. The objective of this procedure was to favor electrostatic interactions between anilinium cations and the silica surface to lead to the formation of silica-polyaniline core-shell particles. Several sets of nanocomposites were prepared under different experimental conditions (oxidant/aniline ratio, silica concentration, temperature, silica particles diameters). The study evidenced that under all the conditions used the formation of core-shell nanoparticles is impossible. However, using different particle sizes, noticeable morphological differences were observed. The use of large silica particles led to the formation of non-uniform polyaniline-silica composites whereas the use of smaller particles always led to raspberry-like morphology as reported by other groups in highly acidic media. The difference in morphology led to different electrical properties with electrical conductivities measured at room temperature ranging from 1.6\u00d710",

    "abstract": "Operant training systems make use of water or food restriction and make it necessary to weigh animals to ensure compliance with experimental endpoints. In other applications periodic weighing is necessary to assess drug side-effects, or as an endpoint in feeding experiments. Periodic weighing while essential can disrupt animal circadian rhythms and social structure.\nAutomatic weighing system within paired mouse homecages. Up to 10 mice freely move between two cages (28\u00d718\u00d79cm) which were connected by a weighing chamber mounted on a load cell. Each mouse was identified using an RFID tag placed under the skin of the neck. A single-board computer (Raspberry Pi; RPi) controls the task, logging RFID tag, load cell weights, and time stamps from each RFID detection until the animal leaves the chamber. Collected data were statistically analyzed to estimate mouse weights. We anticipate integration with tasks where automated imaging or behaviour is assessed in homecages.\nMice frequently move between the two cages, an average of 42+-16 times/day/mouse at which time we obtained weights. We report accurate determination of mouse weight and long term monitoring over 53days. Comparison with existing methods Although commercial systems are available for automatically weighing rodents, they only work with single animals, or are not open source nor cost effective for specific custom application.\nThis automated system permits automated weighing of mice \u223c40 times per day. The system employs inexpensive hardware and open-source Python code.",

    "abstract": "The profile of bile acids (BA) largely depends on the enzymatic activity of the microbiota, but this can be modulated by the dietary addition of biologically active compounds, e.g., polyphenols and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of dietary raspberry pomace as a rich source of biologically active compounds on microbial activity and the BA profile in the caecum of rats fed a high-fat diet. Wistar rats were fed the standard diet AIN-93, a high-fat diet or a modified high-fat diet enriched with 7% different types of processed raspberry pomaces produced by standard grinding and fine grinding, with or without seeds. Rats fed the high-fat diet for 8 weeks showed some disorders in liver function and cecal BA, as manifested by an increased concentration of cholesterol, total BA in the liver and cholic, deoxycholic, and \u03b2-muricholic acids in the cecal digesta. In general, irrespective of the type of raspberry pomace, these dietary preparations decreased liver cholesterol, hepatic fibroblast growth factor receptor 4, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, cecal ammonia and favorable changed BA profile in the cecum. However, among all dietary pomaces, the finely ground preparation containing seeds had the greatest beneficial effect on the caecum by modulating bacterial activity and reducing the levels of secondary BA.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry-like nano-objects made of large plasmonic satellites (>10 nm) covering a central dielectric particle have many potential applications as photonic materials, superlenses and (bio-) sensors, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we show how to build stable and robust raspberry-like nano-systems with close-packed satellites, by combining monodisperse silica particles (80 or 100 nm diameter) and oppositely charged noble metal nanoparticles (Au or Ag) with well-defined sizes (10-50 nm). The spectral characteristics of their associated plasmonic resonances (wavelength, linewidth, extinction cross-section) and the electromagnetic coupling between satellites were observed using the spatial modulation spectroscopy technique and interpreted through a numerical model. The composite nano-objects exhibit numerous hot spots at satellite junctions, resulting in excellent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance. The SERS efficiency of the raspberry-like clusters is highly dependent on their structure.",

    "abstract": "As the incidence of obesity continues to increase, identifying novel nutritional therapies to enhance weight loss are needed. Raspberry ketone (RK; 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl) butan-2-one) is a bioactive phytochemical that is marketed as a weight loss supplement in the United States, yet there is scant scientific evidence demonstrating that RK promotes weight loss. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of RK on accumulation of adipose mass, hepatic lipid storage, and levels of plasma adiponectin in mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet. Mice were individually housed and fed a HF control diet (45% kcal from fat) for two weeks to induce weight gain, then assigned to HF control, high-dose (1.74% wt/wt) raspberry ketone (HRK), low-dose (0.25% wt/wt) raspberry ketone (LRK), or a pair-fed group (PF) fed similar food intake to LRK mice. Following five weeks of feeding, mice fed LRK and HRK diets showed reduced food intake and body weight compared to mice maintained on control diet. When normalized to body weight, mice fed HRK diet exhibited decreased inguinal fat mass and increased liver mass compared to the control group. Hepatic steatosis was lowest in mice fed HRK diet, whereas LRK diet did not have an effect when compared to the PF group. Plasma adiponectin concentration was unaffected by RK and pair-feeding. Our findings demonstrate that RK supplementation has limited benefit to adipose loss beyond reducing energy intake in mice fed a high-fat diet. The present study supports the need for appropriate study design when validating weight-loss supplements.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry fruit intake was investigated on obese diabetic (db/db) mice for 8weeks. Animals fed isocaloric diets (5.3% freeze-dried raspberry, or control) were assessed for obesity-diabetes-disease risk biomarkers. Results showed that raspberry intake improved antioxidant status and lessened plasma interleukin (IL)-6 (0.3-fold of control, p<0.1); most likely through enhancing glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in liver (4.3-fold of control), and in blood (2.1-fold of control). Other disease-risk biomarkers were similar between groups (p>0.05). Plasma levels of total cholesterol (T-CHL), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-CHL), and resistin were higher in the raspberry group. Overall, the enhanced detoxifying cell defenses exerted by raspberry intake might be due to its polyphenolics and fibre. This study demonstrates in vivo that raspberry intake, at a dose that can be achieved by human consumption, might protect against diabetes-induced oxidative stress.",

The liquid culture extract displayed growth inhibition activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a disc diffusion assay. The extract's major component was identified as a new natural product, trienylfuranol A (1S,2S,4R)-1-((1'E,3'E)-hexa-1',3',5'-trienyl)-tetrahydro-4-methylfuran-2-ol (1), by high-resolution LC-MS and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Two additional new metabolites, trienylfuranones A (2) and B (3), were isolated as minor components of the extract and their structure elucidation revealed that they were biosynthetically related to 1. Absolute stereochemical configurations of compounds 1-3 were confirmed by NOE NMR experiments and by the preparation of Mosher esters. Complete hydrogenation of 1 yielded tetrahydrofuran 7 that was used for stereochemical characterization and assessment of antifungal activity.",

    "abstract": "The exposure of human skin to 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone (raspberry ketone, RK) is known to cause chemical/occupational leukoderma. RK has a structure closely related to 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanol (rhododendrol), a skin whitening agent that was found to cause leukoderma in the skin of consumers in 2013. Rhododendrol is a good substrate for tyrosinase and causes a tyrosinase-dependent cytotoxicity to melanocytes, cells that are responsible for skin pigmentation. Therefore, it is expected that RK exerts its cytotoxicity to melanocytes through the tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation to cytotoxic o-quinones. The results of this study demonstrate that the oxidation of RK by mushroom tyrosinase rapidly produces 4-(3-oxobutyl)-1,2-benzoquinone (RK-quinone), which is converted within 10-20 min to (E)-4-(3-oxo-1-butenyl)-1,2-benzoquinone (DBL-quinone). These quinones were identified as their corresponding catechols after reduction by ascorbic acid. RK-quinone and DBL-quinone quantitatively bind to the small thiol N-acetyl-l-cysteine to form thiol adducts and can also bind to the thiol protein bovine serum albumin through its cysteinyl residue. DBL-quinone is more reactive than RK-quinone, as judged by their half-lives (6.2 min vs 10.5 min, respectively), and decays rapidly to form an oligomeric pigment (RK-oligomer). The RK-oligomer can oxidize GSH to GSSG with a concomitant production of hydrogen peroxide, indicating its pro-oxidant activity, similar to that of the RD-oligomer. These results suggest that RK is cytotoxic to melanocytes through the binding of RK-derived quinones to thiol proteins and the pro-oxidant activity of the RK-oligomer.",

    "abstract": "\u03b2-cryptoxanthin (\u03b2-Cry), a xanthophyll, is unlike other abundant carotenoids, such as \u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin. It is not found in most fruits or vegetables but is found only in specific fruits, such as hot chili pepper, persimmon, and citrus fruits. Because recent reports suggest that \u03b2-Cry intake is beneficial to human health, the xanthophyll requires further investigation. Although \u03b2-Cry accumulates in the fruit of wild raspberry, Rubus palmatus, it is not present in cultivated raspberry. In the present study, two wild raspberry species were studied-R.\u00a0palmatus, which accumulates \u03b2-Cry in the fruit, and R.\u00a0crataegifolius, which does not accumulate \u03b2-Cry. Four carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes derived from these two species were analyzed-phytoene synthase (PSY), lycopene \u03b2-cyclase (LCYb), \u03b2-carotene hydroxylase (HYb), and zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP). Expression levels of their genes were also assessed to elucidate mechanism underlying \u03b2-Cry accumulation. Partial gene sequences of RubPSY, RubLCYb, RubHYb, and RubZEP, isolated from immature raspberry fruits of R.\u00a0palmatus, were used as probes for Northern blot analysis. RubZEP expression ceased as the fruits matured, possibly because of reduced production of zeaxanthin. \u03b2-Cry is considered to be an intermediate compound that accumulates in the mature fruits of R.\u00a0palmatus. High expression of RubPSY was detectable in the mature fruits of R.\u00a0crataegifolius, and the expression of RubLCYb, RubHYb, and RubZEP was detectable during all stages of fruit maturation. In contrast, \u03b2-Cry was absent in the mature fruits of R.\u00a0crataegifolius.",

    "abstract": "Functional proteins are very promising for protein therapeutics; however, effective delivery of therapeutic proteins remains challenging. Herein, we developed novel core/satellite nanoparticles by tethering therapeutic proteins to the core/shell polymeric particle surface through cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8])-mediated host-guest interactions. The effectiveness of the core/satellite nanoparticles as protein carrier was demonstrated through the intra-articular delivery of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). We showed that IL-1Ra can effectively self-assemble onto the surface of the polymeric nanoparticles and maintained good protein bioactivity by inhibiting IL-1-mediated signaling. More importantly, in vivo results revealed that IL-1Ra-bounded core/satellite nanoparticles could significantly increase the retention time of IL-1Ra in the rat stifle joint compared to soluble IL-1Ra, which could greatly improve the efficacy of IL-1Ra. These results indicate that the facile host-guest self-assembly can be exploited as an effective approach for realizing the therapeutic potential of proteins.",

We considered the possibility that, as a metabolic enhancer, RK in adult diet might accelerate sexual maturation of male Qflies.\nRecently emerged adult Qfly males (0-24\u2009h old) were exposed to RK-treated food for 48\u2009h and were then provided only sugar and water. Four doses of RK (1.25, 2.5, 3.75 and 5%) along with control (0%) were tested with two types of food: sugar alone and sugar mixed with yeast hydrolysate (3:1). For flies tested when 4-10 days old all RK doses increased mating probability of flies fed sugar mixed with yeast hydrolysate but did not show any effect on mating probability of flies fed only sugar. No effects of RK were found for flies tested when 10-30 days old for either diet group. There was no evidence that RK affected longevity at any of the doses tested.\nFeeding of RK together with yeast hydrolysate to immature Qfly increases mating propensity at young ages and accordingly shows significant potential as a pre-release supplement that might increase the proportion of released flies that attain sexual maturation in Sterile Insect Technique programmes. \u00a9 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",

No effects of RK were found for flies tested when 10-30 days old for either diet group. There was no evidence that RK affected longevity at any of the doses tested.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx comprise the sixth most common malignancies. Histologically, more than 90% of oral cancers are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Epidemiologic data strongly support the role of exogenous factors such as tobacco, alcohol, and human papilloma virus infection as major causative agents. Avoidance of risk factors has only been partially successful, and survival rates have not improved despite advances in therapeutic approaches. Therefore, new or improved approaches to prevention and/or early detection are critical. Better understanding of the mechanisms of oral carcinogenesis can assist in the development of novel biomarkers for early detection and strategies for disease prevention. Toward this goal, several animal models for carcinogenesis in the oral cavity have been developed. Among these are xenograft, and transgenic animal models, and others employing the synthetic carcinogens such as 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene in hamster cheek pouch and 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide in rats and mice. Additional animal models employing environmental carcinogens such as benzo[a]pyrene and N'-nitrosonornicotine have been reported. Each model has certain advantages and disadvantages. Models that (1) utilize environmental carcinogens, (2) reflect tumor heterogeneity, and (3) accurately represent the cellular and molecular changes involved in the initiation and progression of oral cancer in humans could provide a realistic platform. To achieve this goal, we introduced a novel nonsurgical mouse model to study oral carcinogenesis induced by dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DB[a,l]P), an environmental pollutant and tobacco smoke constituent, and its diol epoxide metabolite (\u00b1)-anti-11,12-dihydroxy-13,14-epoxy-11,12,13,14-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,l]pyrene [(\u00b1)-anti-DB[a,l]PDE]. On the basis of a detailed comparison of oral cancer induced by DB[a,l]P with that induced by the other above-mentioned oral carcinogens with respect to dose, duration, species and strain, cellular and molecular targets, and relative carcinogenic potency, our animal model may offer a more realistic platform to study oral carcinogenesis. In this perspective, we also discuss our preclinical studies to demonstrate the potential of black raspberry extracts on the prevention of OSCC. Specifically, we were the first to demonstrate that black raspberry inhibited DB[a,l]P-DNA binding and of particular importance its capacity to enhance the repair of DB[a,l]P-induced bulky lesions in DNA. We believe that the information presented in this perspective will stimulate further research on the impact of environmental carcinogens in the development of oral cancer and may lead to novel strategies toward the control and prevention of this disease.",

    "abstract": "QTL mapping identifies a range of underlying and unrelated genes with apparent roles in raspberry fruit ripening and softening that show characteristic developing fruit expression profiles. Fruit softening is an important agronomical trait that involves a complex interaction of plant cell processes. We have used both qualitative and quantitative scoring of fruit firmness, length, mass, and resistance to applied force to identify QTL in a raspberry mapping population. QTLs were located primarily on linkage group (LG) 3 with other significant loci on LG 1 and LG 5 and showed mostly additive effects between the two parents. The expression of key genes that underlie these QTLs with roles in cell-wall solubility, water uptake, polyamine synthesis, transcription, and cell respiration was tested across five stages of fruit development, from immature green to red ripe fruit, using real-time RT-qPCR. Gene expression patterns showed variable expression patterns across fruit development with a highly significant positive and negative correlation between genes, supporting precise regulation of expression of different cell processes throughout raspberry fruit development. Variable timing in expression was also found in some genes at different fruit development stages between soft and firm cultivars. Multiple processes have a role to play in fruit softening and this will require development of multiple marker combinations to genes that characterise raspberry fruit softening.",

The outcomes of the model demonstrate the presence of NoV in raspberry puree or individual quick frozen (IQF) raspberry fruits and were generated by Monte Carlo simulations by combining GoldSim\u00ae and @Risk\u00ae software. Input data were collected from scientific literature, observational studies and assumptions. NoV contamination of soft red fruits is assumed to take place at farms by application of contaminated water for pesticides dilution or by berries' pickers shedding NoV. The model was built simulating that a collection center received berries from ten farms with a total of 245 food handlers picking soft red fruits during a 10-hour day shift. Given 0, 5 and 20 out of 245 berries' pickers were shedding NoV, these conditions were calculated to result in a mean NoV contamination of respectively 0.47, 14.1 and 36.2 NoV particles per kg raspberries in case all raspberries are mixed to one day-batch of 11tons. The NoV contamination of the fruits was mainly driven by the route of NoV shedding food pickers (95.8%) rather than by spraying contaminated pesticide water (4.2%) (baseline scenario with 5 shedding pickers and contaminated pesticide water). Inclusion of appropriate hand washing procedures or hand washing followed by hand disinfection resulted in estimated reductions of the mean NoV levels from 14.1 to 0.16 and 0.17 NoV particles per kg raspberries, respectively, for the baseline scenario with 5 out of 245 food pickers shedding NoV. The use of a mild heat treatment (30s at 75\u00b0C) during further processing of berries to purees was noted to reduce mean NoV levels substantially from 14.1 to 0.2 NoV particles per kg raspberry puree. For IQF raspberries, the NoV contamination is heterogeneously distributed and resulted in a mean contamination of 3.1 NoV particles per 250g package containing approximately 115 berries. This farm-to-fork model is a useful tool for evaluating NoV mitigation strategies in the soft red fruit supply chain.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic porous nanostructures consisting of oriented aggregates of iron oxide nanocrystals display very interesting properties such as a lower oxidation state of magnetite, and enhanced saturation magnetization in comparison with individual nanoparticles of similar sizes and porosity. However, the formation mechanism of these promising nanostructures is not well understood, which hampers the fine tuning of their magnetic properties, for instance by doping them with other elements. Therefore the formation mechanism of porous raspberry shaped nanostructures (RSNs) synthesized by a one-pot polyol solvothermal method has been investigated in detail from the early stages by using a wide panel of characterization techniques, and especially by performing original in situ HR-TEM studies in temperature. A time-resolved study showed the intermediate formation of an amorphous iron alkoxide phase with a plate-like lamellar structure (PLS). Then, the fine investigation of PLS transformation upon heating up to 500 \u00b0C confirmed that the synthesis of RSNs involves two iron precursors: the starting one (hydrated iron chlorides) and the in situ formed iron alkoxide precursor which decomposes with time and heating and contributes to the growth step of nanostructures. Such an understanding of the formation mechanism of RSNs is necessary to envision efficient and rational enhancement of their magnetic properties.",

    "abstract": "Automation of animal experimentation improves consistency, reduces potential for error while decreasing animal stress and increasing well-being. Radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging can identify individual mice in group housing environments enabling animal-specific tracking of physiological parameters.\nWe describe a simple protocol to radio frequency identification (RFID) tag and detect mice. RFID tags were injected sub-cutaneously after brief isoflurane anesthesia and do not require surgical steps such as suturing or incisions. We employ glass-encapsulated 125kHz tags that can be read within 30.2\u00b12.4mm of the antenna. A raspberry pi single board computer and tag reader enable automated logging and cross platform support is possible through Python.\nWe provide sample software written in Python to provide a flexible and cost effective system for logging the weights of multiple mice in relation to pre-defined targets.\nThe sample software can serve as the basis of any behavioral or physiological task where users will need to identify and track specific animals. Recently, we have applied this system of tagging to automated mouse brain imaging within home-cages.\nWe provide a cost effective solution employing open source software to facilitate adoption in applications such as automated imaging or tracking individual animal weights during tasks where food or water restriction is employed as motivation for a specific behavior.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) experiments are typically performed in controlled laboratory settings to minimise noise and produce reliable measurements. These controlled conditions also reduce the applicability of the obtained results to more varied environments and may limit their relevance to everyday situations.\nAdvances in computer portability may increase the mobility and applicability of EEG results while decreasing costs. In this experiment we show that stimulus presentation using a Raspberry Pi 2 computer provides a low cost, reliable alternative to a traditional desktop PC in the administration of EEG experimental tasks.\nSignificant and reliable MMN and P3 activity, typical event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with an auditory oddball paradigm, were measured while experiments were administered using the Raspberry Pi 2. While latency differences in ERP triggering were observed between systems, these differences reduced power only marginally, likely due to the reduced processing power of the Raspberry Pi 2.\nAn auditory oddball task administered using the Raspberry Pi 2 produced similar ERPs to those derived from a desktop PC in a laboratory setting. Despite temporal differences and slight increases in trials needed for similar statistical power, the Raspberry Pi 2 can be used to design and present auditory experiments comparable to a PC.\nOur results show that the Raspberry Pi 2 is a low cost alternative to the desktop PC when administering EEG experiments and, due to its small size and low power consumption, will enable mobile EEG experiments unconstrained by a traditional laboratory setting.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is an integral part of the neurodegeneration process inherent to several aging dysfunctions. Within the central nervous system, microglia are the effective immune cells, responsible for neuroinflammatory responses. In this study, raspberries were subjected to in vitro digestion simulation to obtain the components that result from the gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, which would be bioaccessible and available for blood uptake. Both the original raspberry extract and the gastrointestinal bioaccessible (GIB) fraction protected neuronal and microglia cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation, at low concentrations. Furthermore, this neuroprotective capacity was independent of intracellular ROS scavenging mechanisms. We show for the first time that raspberry metabolites present in the GIB fraction significantly inhibited microglial pro-inflammatory activation by LPS, through the inhibition of Iba1 expression, TNF-\u03b1 release and NO production. Altogether, this study reveals that raspberry polyphenols may present a dietary route to the retardation or amelioration of neurodegenerative-related dysfunctions.",
