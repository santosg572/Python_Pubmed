    "abstract": "Monitoring blood coagulation in response to an anticoagulant (heparin) and its reversal agent (protamine) is essential during and after surgery, especially with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A current clinical standard is the use of activated clotting time (ACT), where the mechanical movement of a plunger through a whole blood-filled channel is monitored to evaluate the endpoint time of coagulation. As a rapid, simple, low-volume, and cost-effective alternative, we have developed a paper microfluidic assay and Raspberry Pi-based device with the aim of quantifying the extent of blood coagulation in response to varying doses of heparin and protamine. The flow rate of blood through the paper microfluidic channel is automatically monitored using Python-coded edge detection algorithm. For each set of assay, 8 ",

    "abstract": "We built a low-cost and hand-held device to image and analyze microfluidic droplets mainly for educational/teaching purposes in laboratory settings of universities. The device was assembled based on a Raspberry Pi with a camera attached on the back and an LCD screen on the top. We evaluated the performance of this device to capture images and videos to visualize high-throughput droplet generation in a microfluidic device. The qualities of imaging resolution and speed were sufficient for us to perform subsequent droplet analysis quantitatively through automatic image possessing. Droplet characteristics including droplet size, volume, and dispersity, as well as droplet intensity, have been measured, showing the potential of this device to analyze droplet-based assays. Most importantly, in addition to learning the knowledge and principles from classroom lectures, students can thus gain practice of using an advanced, state-of-the-art technology in a laboratory course. It will also open up opportunities to train students with skills of interdisciplinary thinking and learning.",

    "abstract": "Torulaspora delbrueckii is a widely studied non-Saccharomyces yeast, described as having a positive impact on the organoleptic quality of wines, however, little is known about its impact on the production of raspberry wine. In this study, we compared combined use of S. cerevisiae/T. delbrueckii pair, i.e., in sequential inoculation (RT) and co-fermentation (RC) modes, with spontaneous fermentation (RU) and single S. cerevisiae inoculation (RS), on various properties of raspberry wine including fermentation behaviors (using yeast counts and next-generation sequencing method), basic composition (by OIV, 2019), volatile profile (using headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry), sensory property (by quantitative descriptive analyses) and biogenic amine levels. All the alcoholic fermentations were completed within 9\u00a0days; T. delbrueckii was inhibited by S. cerevisiae in the co-culture; and Saccharomyces and Mrakia were the most abundant species in RU. A total of 40 aromas was identified, with RT abundant in volatile esters, ketones and terpenes and others showing relatively lower intensities. During sensory evaluation, RT was characterized by 'fruity' and 'sweet' notes; RC was notable for a high 'floral' attribute; RU scored the highest in 'pungent' and RS showed intermedium intensities for most descriptors. Partial least squares regression showed the relationship between aromas and sensory descriptors. As for biogenic amine, RU contained the highest total amount and RS had the least. Overall, RT had greater potential to be used in the production of raspberry wine.",

    "abstract": "This study involves microencapsulation of anthocyanin extract (AC) from red raspberry using a freeze drying technique involving ultrasonication of soy protein isolate (SPI), gum arabic (AG), and their combination. Analyses included microcapsule properties, encapsulation efficiency, antioxidant capacity using the DPPH assay, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), color, thermal stability, stability during storage, morphology, and simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Encapsulation efficiency (EE) ranged from 93.05% to 98.87% for all microcapsules. The morphology of microcapsules by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated a broken glass shape, with mean size of microcapsules ranging from 21.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.71\u00a0\u03bcm to 48.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.33\u00a0\u03bcm using Mastersizer analyzer. A good relationship obtained between zeta potential (ZP) and FTIR spectrum indicated that there is a chemical cross linking interaction between wall material and core material. All microcapsules enhanced the thermal stability of AC in the temperature range 80-114\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, AC retention (up to 48%) during storage at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0days revealed that treatment H combination of SPI and AG was best. In addition, SPI and AG combination presented good release behavior under simulated gastrointestinal conditions compared with unencapsulated anthocyanin.",

    "abstract": "Automatic decision support systems have gained importance in health sector in recent years. In parallel with recent developments in the fields of artificial intelligence and image processing, embedded systems are also used in decision support systems for tumor diagnosis. Extreme learning machine (ELM), is a recently developed, quick and efficient algorithm which can quickly and flawlessly diagnose tumors using machine learning techniques. Similarly, significantly fast and robust fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm (FRFCM) is a novel and fast algorithm which can display a high performance. In the present study, a brain tumor segmentation approach is proposed based on extreme learning machine and significantly fast and robust fuzzy C-means clustering algorithms (BTS-ELM-FRFCM) running on Raspberry Pi (PRI) hardware. The present study mainly aims to introduce a new segmentation system hardware containing new algorithms and offering a high level of accuracy the health sector. PRI's are useful mobile devices due to their cost-effectiveness and satisfying hardware. 3200 training images were used to train ELM in the present study. 20 pieces of MRI images were used for testing process. Figure of merid (FOM), Jaccard similarity coefficient (JSC) and Dice indexes were used in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. In addition, the proposed method was compared with brain tumor segmentation based on support vector machine (BTS-SVM), brain tumor segmentation based on fuzzy C-means (BTS-FCM) and brain tumor segmentation based on self-organizing maps and k-means (BTS-SOM). The statistical analysis on FOM, JSC and Dice results obtained using four different approaches indicated that BTS-ELM-FRFCM displayed the highest performance. Thus, it can be concluded that the embedded system designed in the present study can perform brain tumor segmentation with a high accuracy rate.",

    "abstract": "The authors aim to investigate the mechanisms by which red raspberry (RR) polyphenolic fractions regulate obesity and inflammation with an emphasis on the crosstalk between adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) and adipocyte progenitors.\nC57BL/6 male mice are fed either a high-fat (HF) diet or an HF diet supplemented with a RR polyphenolic fraction from whole fruit, pulp, or seed. Supplementation with pulp significantly increases energy expenditure and reduces HF-diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. The pulp, and to a lesser extent, whole polyphenols, decreases the recruitment of ATM, activation of the nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, and adipocyte hypertrophy, which is associated with epigenetic modulation of adipogenesis (e.g., H3K27Ac, H3K9Ac). Results from an IL-1\u03b2 reporter assay in J774 macrophages recapitulate the inhibitory role of RR polyphenols on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Using conditioned media from macrophages, it is demonstrated that RR polyphenols reverse the IL-1\u03b2-mediated epigenetic suppression of H3K27Ac in adipocyte progenitor cells.\nRR polyphenols from pulp and whole fruit serve as an inhibitor for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and an epigenetic modifier to regulate adipogenesis, which confers resistance against diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "It is reported that black raspberry (BRB) anthocyanins could act as a potential chemopreventive agent for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the underlying mechanism by which BRB anthocyanins inhibits the carcinogenesis of CRC cells has not been elucidated. The abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) that target important tumor suppressor genes is usually associated with CRC development. In this study, we explored whether BRB anthocyanins could affect the expression of certain miRNAs in an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced CRC mouse model and human CRC cell lines. miRNA microarray analysis was used to determine the differences in miRNA expression between AOM/DSS-induced mice fed with a diet supplemented without or with BRB anthocyanins. The expression of one particular miRNA, miR-483-3p, was found to decrease dramatically in AOM/DSS-induced mice that were fed with a diet supplemented with BRB anthocyanins. Subsequent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses showed that the reduced expression of miR-483-3p was accompanied by an increased expression of Dickkopf 3 (DKK3), a potential target of miR-483-3p as predicted by bioinformatic analysis. The protein and messenger RNA levels of DKK3 were significantly upregulated when the miR-483-3p level was reduced by a miR-483-3p-specific inhibitor, suggesting that DKK3 might be the target gene of miR-483-3p. In addition, the downstream factors of the DKK3 signaling pathway, which included Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, also played a role in the miR-483-3p-mediated anticancer effect of BRB anthocyanins. Thus, miR-483-3p might be a potential target in BRB anthocyanin-mediated prevention of CRC.",

    "abstract": "Being delicious and containing strong disease-fighting agents, berries represent an increasing proportion of fruits consumed nowadays in our diet. However, berries are highly perishable as fresh and, therefore, they are usually processed into various products to extend their shelf-life and availability throughout the year. Among the fruit-containing products, jam is one of the most common due to its nourishing properties, its low production costs, and its accessibility for a lengthy period. Rather than home preparation, consumers nowadays increasingly prefer to purchase commercial jams from markets due to its convenience. Although fresh berries have been extensively studied for their phenolic compounds, a limited number of studies investigating commercially manufactured jams have been conducted so far. Considering this, the objective of this study was to assess the total phenolic, flavonoid, and anthocyanin content and the antioxidant activity of five commonly consumed commercial berry jams (blueberry (",

    "abstract": "In this work, an efficient method for the rapid extraction and separation of antioxidant phenols was developed and optimized. The method was then applied to extract and separate nine phenols from 37 varieties of raspberry, in which their antioxidant activities were further investigated. First, the extraction was conducted using ultra-sonication, which was then further separated using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography/ultraviolet (RP-HPLC/UV) analysis. In this step, several key parameters (volume of the extraction reagent, time of extraction, and the temperature of extraction) affecting its efficiency were investigated and optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM) combined with the Box-Behnken design (BBD) so that the optimal conditions were obtained. According to the overall results of the optimization study, the optimal conditions were chosen as follows: volume of extraction reagent = 2.0 mL, time of extraction = 50.0 min, and temperature of extraction = 50 \u00b0C. The optimal conditions were then applied to extract nine phenols, including gallic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, cumaric acid, ferulic acid, rosemary acid, and quercetin from 37 raspberry varieties. The extracted phenols were characterized and their antioxidant activities, including DPPH",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone is a primary aroma component of the red raspberry. The glycosylation of this compound is a potential approach used to improve its pharmaceutical properties. In this work, raspberry ketone glycosides are produced in bacteria for the first time. Bacillus licheniformis PI15, an organic solvent-tolerant glycosyltransferase-producing strain, was isolated from chemically polluted soil. The cloning and heterologous expression of a glycosyltransferase, which was designated PI-GT1, in Escherichia coli BL21 resulted in the expression of an active and soluble protein that accounted for 15% of the total cell protein content. Purified PI-GT1 was highly active and stable over a broad pH range (6.0-10.0) and showed excellent pH stability. PI-GT1 maintained almost 60% of its maximal activity after 3\u00a0H of incubation at 20-40\u00a0\u00b0C and demonstrated optimal activity at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Additionally, PI-GT1 displayed high stability and activity in the presence of hydrophilic solvents with log P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0-0.2 and retained more than 80% of its activity after 3\u00a0H of treatment. Supplementation with 10% DMSO markedly improved the glycosylation of raspberry ketone, resulting in a value 26 times higher than that in aqueous solution. The organic solvent-tolerant PI-GT1 may have potential uses in industrial chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis applications.",

    "abstract": "In 2018, an outbreak of leptospirosis was identified among raspberry workers from a mixed-berry farm in New South Wales, Australia. Initial testing had not revealed a cause, but eventually leptospirosis was detected via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Further serological testing detected Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Arborea, of which rodents are the predominant reservoir. Leptospirosis is rare in Australia, with outbreaks usually related to flooding. We conducted an investigation to identify risk factors for infection, to inform control measures.\nCases were detected through laboratory notifications, hospital-based syndromic surveillance, awareness-raising among farm employees and clinician alerts. Confirmed cases had a four-fold rise in antibody titre or single titre \u2265400 on microscopic agglutination test, and a positive IgM. Probable cases had a positive Leptospira PCR or IgM, and possible cases had a clinically compatible illness. We conducted a case-control study among raspberry workers on the farm and compared reported exposures between cases and seronegative controls. We assessed environmental risks on-site and tested rodents for leptospirosis.\nWe identified 84 cases over a 5-month period (50 confirmed, 19 probable and 15 possible). Compared with controls, cases were less likely to wear gloves and more recently employed. Cases also more commonly reported always having scratched hands, likely from the thorns on raspberry plants. We observed evidence of rodent activity around raspberry plants and three of thirteen trapped mice tested positive for Leptospira Arborea. Control measures included enhanced glove use, doxycycline prophylaxis and rodent control.\nThis is the largest known outbreak of leptospirosis in Australia. Workers were likely exposed through scratches inflicted during harvesting, which became contaminated with environmental leptospires from mice. Leptospirosis should be considered an occupational risk for raspberry workers, requiring protective measures. Chemoprophylaxis may assist in controlling outbreaks. PCR assists in the early diagnosis and detection of leptospirosis and should be included in surveillance case definitions.",

We observed evidence of rodent activity around raspberry plants and three of thirteen trapped mice tested positive for Leptospira Arborea. Control measures included enhanced glove use, doxycycline prophylaxis and rodent control.",

    "abstract": "Predictive maintenance techniques can determine the conditions of equipment in order to evaluate when maintenance should be performed. Thus, it minimizes the unexpected device downtime, lowers the maintenance costs, extends equipment lifecycle, etc. Therefore, this article developed a predictive maintenance mechanism with the construction of a test platform and data analysis along with machine learning. The information transmission of sensors was based on Raspberry Pi via the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) communication protocol. The sensors used for environmental sensing were implemented on the programmable interface controller and the data were stored in time sequence. A statistical analysis software platform was adopted for data preprocessing, modelling, and prediction to provide necessary maintenance decision. Using multivariate analysis users can obtain more information about the equipment's status, and the administrator can also determine the operational situation before unexpected device anomalies. The developed modules are decisively helpful in preventing unpredictable losses, thus improving the quality of services.",

    "abstract": "Automated weeding is an important research area in agrorobotics. Weeds can be removed mechanically or with the precise usage of herbicides. Deep Learning techniques achieved state of the art results in many computer vision tasks, however their deployment on low-cost mobile computers is still challenging. The described system contains several novelties, compared both with its previous version and related work. It is a part of a project of the automatic weeding machine, developed by the Warsaw University of Technology and MCMS Warka Ltd. Obtained models reach satisfying accuracy (detecting 47-67% of weed area, misclasifing as weed 0.1-0.9% of crop area) at over 10 FPS on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ computer. It was tested for four different plant species at different growth stadiums and lighting conditions. The system performing semantic segmentation is based on Convolutional Neural Networks. Its custom architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet and ResNet concepts. Amount of needed manual ground truth labels was significantly decreased by the usage of the knowledge distillation process, learning final model which mimics an ensemble of complex models on a large database of unlabeled data. Further decrease of the inference time was obtained by two custom modifications: in the usage of separable convolutions in DenseNet block and in the number of channels in each layer. In the authors' opinion, the described novelties can be easily transferred to other agrorobotics tasks.",

    "abstract": "Effects of red raspberry extract (RRE) intake on hyperlipidemia mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD) were investigated in this study. After intragastric gavage of RRE for 8 weeks, the body weight and the adipose tissue mass of mice in RRE administration groups significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) decreased compared to the group without RRE treatment. RRE treatment significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) lowered triglyceride and total cholesterol levels of hyperlipidemia mice. Ppar\u03b1, Hmgcr, Ldlr, Cyp7a1, Acsl3, Pnpla2 and Pin4 were confirmed as the regulatory genes by transcriptome analysis and qRCR validation. According to KEGG pathway analysis, target genes such as Cyp7a1 and Pin4 were further regulated by the activation of PPAR\u03b1 resulting from RRE supplementation. Meanwhile, liver cholesterol synthesis and conversion were inhibited by the expressions of Hmgcr and Cyp7a1 genes regulated by RRE intake, and Ldlr gene was down-regulated to limit the transport of cholesterol. In addition, RRE treatment could accelerate the conversion from triglyceride to fatty acid. To conclusion, RRE intake would be a protection against diet-induced hypertriglyceridemia.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry-like hollow-spheres-on-sphere (HSOS) particles with reactive surfaces, uniform sizes and monodisperse properties were rational designed and fabricated to immobilize gold nanoparticles for the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol. HSOS polysilsesquioxane (PSQ) particles were constructed by an organic alkali catalyzed sol-gel process from trialkoxysilane precursors with stabilized polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles as both a sacrifice template and a Pickering emulsifier. The PSQ particles were fabricated in an ice bath with methyltrimethoxysilane and mercaptopropyltrimethoxysiane as a co-precursor, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) as a catalyst, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and sodium lignosulfonat as co-stabilizers and PS latex as a hard template. The formation mechanism of the hierarchical particles was investigated in detail by the time study through imaging the particles at regular time intervals during the reaction process. Various effect factors on the morphology were studied systematically which showed that the precursor composition, the content of PS, TMAH and PVP are the most important factors. The hierarchical structure combined with the mercaptopropyl groups on both the surface and the skeleton to make it possible to adsorb guest molecules. Au nanoparticles were immobilized on the particles for the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. The unique PSQ colloids with hollow-spheres-on-sphere extended the family of the hierarchical structures and has shown the potential applications in separations, drug delivery and heterogeneous catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Ethanol consumption is one of the common causative agents implicated in gastric ulcer development. Oxidative stress plays a major role in the induction and development of gastric ulceration. NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) are key players in ethanol-induced ulcers. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a ubiquitous nuclear protein, mediates various inflammation functions. However, the role of HMGB1 in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer is not yet elucidated. Raspberry Ketone (RK) is a natural phenolic compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, absolute ethanol (7.5 ml/kg) was used to induce gastric ulceration in rats. Raspberry Ketone (RK) (50 mg/kg) was given orally one hour before the administration of absolute ethanol. Interestingly, ethanol-induced gastric ulcer was associated with Nrf2 downregulation, which was correlated with NOX-1, 2 NOX-4, and HMGB1 upregulation, and was significantly reversed by RK pre-treatment. RK pre-treatment provided 80% gastroprotection. Gastroprotective properties of RK were mediated via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory (suppression of NF-kB and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1), and antiapoptotic activities (reduction of Bax/Bcl2 ratio). Gastroprotective properties of RK were confirmed by histopathological examination. In conclusion, this study is the first to provide evidence to the role of HMGB1 in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer, and the crosstalk of Nrf2, NOXs and HMGB1. It also demonstrates that RK represents a promising gastroprotective activity comparable to omeprazole.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry fruits are a perfect source of polyphenols, including flavonols, anthocyanins. Some experiments have indicated that organic fruits contain more bioactive compounds than conventional fruits. The aim of this study was therefore to analyse and compare the concentration of bioactive compounds in organic vs. conventional raspberries and to determine the effects of harvest time and cultivar. Three cultivars of raspberry ('Laszka', 'Glen Ample' and 'Glen Fine') that were harvested in summer and one 'Polka' cv. that was harvested in autumn time from organic and conventional cultivation methods were used in the experiment. The contents of dry matter and polyphenols in the fruits were determined. The organic samples contained significantly more dry matter, phenolic acid and flavonoids, including myrycetin, quercetin, luteolin and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside. Harvest time was an important factor in raspberry fruit quality.",

    "abstract": "Oral cancer is a public health problem with an incidence of almost 50,000 and a mortality of 10,000 each year in the USA alone. Black raspberries (BRBs) have been shown to inhibit oral carcinogenesis in several preclinical models, but our understanding of how BRB phytochemicals affect the metabolic pathways during oral carcinogenesis remains incomplete. We used a well-established rat oral cancer model to determine potential metabolic pathways impacted by BRBs during oral carcinogenesis. F344 rats were exposed to the oral carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in drinking water for 14 weeks, then regular drinking water for six weeks. Carcinogen exposed rats were fed a 5% or 10% BRB supplemented diet or control diet for six weeks after carcinogen exposure. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis on rat tongue, and mass spectrometry and NMR metabolomics analysis on rat urine were performed. We tentatively identified 57 differentially or uniquely expressed metabolites and over 662 modulated genes in rats being fed with BRB. Glycolysis and AMPK pathways were modulated during BRB-mediated oral cancer chemoprevention. Glycolytic enzymes ",

    "abstract": "Research has shown that berries may have the ability to reverse, reduce, or slow the progression of behavioral dysfunction associated with aging and neurodegenerative disease. In contrast, high-energy and high-fat diets (HFD) may result in behavioral deficits like those seen in aging animals. This research examined whether red raspberry (\nEight-week-old mice consumed a HFD (60% calories from fat) or a control diet (CD) with and without 4% freeze-dried red raspberry (RB). Behavioral tests and biochemical assays of brain tissue and serum were conducted.\nAfter 12 weeks on the diets, mice fed CD and HFD had impaired novel object recognition, but mice on the RB-supplemented diets did not. After approximately 20 weeks on the diets, mice fed HFD\u2009+\u2009RB had shorter latencies to find the escape hole in the Barnes maze than the HFD-fed mice. Interleukin (IL)-6 was significantly elevated in the cortex of mice fed HFD; while mice fed the CD, CD\u2009+\u2009RB, and HFD\u2009+\u2009RB did not show a similar elevation. There was also evidence of increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brains of mice fed RB diets. This reduction in IL-6 and increase in BDNF may contribute to the preservation of learning and memory in HFD\u2009+\u2009RB mice.\nThis study demonstrates that RB may protect against the effects HFD has on brain and behavior; however, further research with human subjects is needed to confirm these benefits.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK) is the characteristic aromatic compound in raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) with wide applications as food additive and anti-obesity agent. However, quantification of RK has presented difficulties in MS detection and reliable LC-MS method for RK analysis in literature is in limit to date. In order to facilitate quality control of raspberry derived products and RK metabolomics study, this study aimed to develop a validated and sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS method. Strong in-source fragmentation was noted and the fragmental ion of 107\u00a0m/z produced was selected as the precursor ion for MRM detection, and as such the electrospray ionization performance was optimized by fractional factorial design to accommodate such ion-source dissociation behavior as well as its moderate volatility. A pathway involving the formation of quinone-like structure with strong conjugation was proposed to explain the intense in-source fragmentation. The MRM transition was optimized with product ion of 77\u00a0m/z selected as the quantifier ion. The method featured low limit of quantification of \u223c2\u00a0ng/mL and allowed for rapid detection of RK in fresh raspberries following direct sample preparation. RK contents were found to be higher from locally grown and harvested farm sources compared to commercial products shipped into the state, and higher in those at late-stage compared with early-stage maturity. No correlations in RK content between organic and non-organic labels were noted.",

The samples were submitted to an ohmic system and conventional pasteurization (65\u202f\u00b0C-30\u202fmin). Both processing led to increases in the color parameters (C*, h* and \u2206E*) in the first 30\u202fmin. For the treatments, 10\u202fHz-25\u202fV and 1000\u202fHz-25\u202fV, more viscous, and consequently increased D[4,3] and D[3,2] values were observed, and similar results were obtained for the DSC behavior. The microstructure confirmed aggregation of cell structure in those configurations (10\u202fHz and 1000\u202fHz-25\u202fV). OH, parameters for both ohmic configurations have an impact in all the evaluated parameters for raspberry-flavored whey drink, which can be interesting for the dairy industry.",

The inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase, \u03b1-amylase, and angiotensin-converting I enzymes, antioxidant capacity, fatty acid profile, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were determined. OH treated samples presented lower anthocyanins content than the conventional treatment (2.91\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23\u202fmg/g), while the mild-intermediate conditions (10,100-Hz at 25\u202fV and 45,60-V at 60\u202fHz) presented the highest chemical antioxidant activity when compared to the extreme processing conditions (1000\u202fHz-25\u202fV and 80\u202fV-60\u202fHz). OH led to an increase of 10% in both \u03b1-glucosidase (>99%) and \u03b1-amylase (\u226570%). Among the VOCs, furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, a major intermediate Maillard reaction product was found in all treatments. Overall, OH can be used in the processing of whey-flavored raspberry beverages.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberries (Rubus idaeus) contain numerous phenolic compounds with purported health benefits. Raspberry ketone (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone) is a primary raspberry flavor phenolic found in raspberries and is designated as a synthetic flavoring agent by the Food and Drug Administration. Synthetic raspberry ketone has been demonstrated to result in weight loss in rodents. We tested whether phenolic-enriched raspberry extracts, compared with raspberry ketone, would be more resilient to the metabolic alterations caused by an obesogenic diet. Male C57BL/6J mice (8\u202fweeks old) received a daily oral dose of vehicle (VEH; 50% propylene glycol, 40% water, and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide), raspberry extract low (REL; 0.2\u202fg/kg), raspberry extract high (REH; 2\u202fg/kg), or raspberry ketone (RK; 0.2\u202fg/kg). Coincident with daily dosing, mice were placed on a high-fat diet (45% fat). After 4\u202fweeks, REH and RK reduced body weight gain (approximately 5%-9%) and white adipose mass (approximately 20%) compared with VEH. Hepatic gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 and lipoprotein lipase was upregulated in REH compared with VEH. Indirect calorimetry indicated that respiratory exchange ratio (CO",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States and the fourth globally with a rising incidence. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic immunologically mediated disease that imposes a significant associated health burden, including the increased risk for colonic dysplasia and CRC. Carcinogenesis has been attributed to chronic inflammation and associated with oxidative stress, genomic instability, and immune effectors as well as the cytokine dysregulation and activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) signaling pathway. Current anti-inflammation therapies used for IBD treatment have shown limited effects on CRC chemoprevention, and their long-term toxicity has limited their clinical application. However, natural food-based prevention approaches may offer significant cancer prevention effects with very low toxicity profiles. In particular, in preclinical and clinical pilot studies, strawberry and black raspberry have been widely selected as food-based interventions because of their potent preventive activities. In this review, we summarize the roles of strawberry, black raspberry, and their polyphenol components on CRC chemoprevention in IBD.",

    "abstract": "Industrial processing of raspberries into juice and jam results in the production of with high content of lipophilic and hydrophilic phytochemicals. Usually considered as waste, raspberry pomace is occasionally cold-pressed to recover specialty oil. However, the resulting pomace press-cake (PPC) still contains 30% to 35% of lipophilic compounds, such as essential fatty acids, tocols, phytosterols, and ellagitannins initially present in pomace. In a perspective of sustainable development, we investigate an eco-friendly process using an aqueous enzyme-assisted extraction (AEAE) to simultaneously and effectively recover lipophilic compounds and polyphenols from the PPC. The performance of different combinations of carbohydrases and proteases was compared. After selecting the best enzymatic system, a definitive screening design involving six factors was then implemented to optimize the process. Under optimized conditions, 1.2 units of thermostable alkaline protease/100 g PPC, pH 9, 60 \u00b0C, and 2 hr hydrolysis, more than 38% of total PPC lipophilic content were recovered in the aqueous medium. The recovery of polyphenols and antioxidant activity was, respectively, 48% and 25% higher than obtained by extraction with methanol/acetone/water mixture. Such an AEAE extract might prove useful in food and nutraceutical applications. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Raspberry pomace, a food industrial by-product, is often considered as waste. However, it is a rich source of phytochemicals, such as tocols, polyphenols, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. To overcome the drawbacks of organic solvent use, an enzyme-assisted extraction process was developed as an eco-friendly alternative to recover these bioactive compounds. Definitive screening design experimental design was used to enhance polyphenols and lipophilics extraction yields while reducing process costs. This extract is an oil-in-water emulsion, with high content in antioxidant phytochemicals, which might have potential for use in nutraceutical applications. Therefore, this green process developed for the valorization of raspberry pomace is considered as a perspective of sustainable development.",

Small powerful single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi\u2122 offer researchers a low-cost alternative to expensive operant chambers. In this paper, we describe two new operant chambers, one using nose-poke ports as operanda and another using a touchscreen. To validate the chamber designs, rats learned to perform both visual discrimination and delayed alternation tasks in each chamber. Designs and codes are open source and serve as a starting point for researchers to develop behavioral experiments or educational demonstrations.",

    "abstract": "This study presents the effect of raspberry pomace and its grinding level on microbial activity in the gastrointestinal tract as well as on the parameters involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism in Wistar rats. The nutritional experiment was performed using 24 male Wistar rats, which were divided into 3 groups of 8 animals each. The animals were fed a standard diet (C) or a modified diet containing 7% raspberry pomace subjected to standard (SG) or fine (FG) grinding. Finer grinding increased the concentration of polyphenols and altered the composition of the dietary fibre, thereby affecting the intestinal microbial activity and related mechanisms that regulate systemic parameters. The FG diet considerably increased the level of total ellagitannin metabolites in the colon (23.56\u202f\u03bcg/g for SG and 79.54\u202f\u03bcg/g for FG) and plasma (0.029\u202f\u03bcg/mL for SG and 0.041\u202f\u03bcg/mL for FG) and reduced \u03b2-glucuronidase and \u03b1-glucosidase activity (19.2 and 19.7 for SG and 13.3 and 8.7\u202f\u03bcmol/h/g for FG, respectively) and short-chain fatty acid production (55.84\u202f\u03bcmol/g for SG and 48.60\u202f\u03bcmol/g for FG) in the caecum. Compared to the SG, the FG diet improved the antioxidant capacity of water-soluble substances in plasma (4.34\u202f\u03bcg/mL for SG and 4.92\u202f\u03bcg/mL for FG). Both diets with raspberry pomaces increased the plasma HDL cholesterol (0.48\u202fmmol/L for C, 0.56\u202fmmol/L for SG, 0.57\u202fmmol/L for FG) and decreased the atherogenic index (AI\u202f=\u202f(TC-HDL)/HDL: 2.57 for C, 1.98 for SG, 2.00 for FG). The FG diet resulted in the lowest plasma glucose level (10.8\u202fmmol/L for C, 8.2\u202fmmol/L for SG, 7.3\u202fmmol/L for FG). In conclusion, both diets with raspberry pomaces modulated intestinal microbial activity and related systemic parameters; however, FG pomace exhibited greater inhibitory effects than SG pomace in the lower gut environment and glucose metabolism.",

    "abstract": "In this experiment,the antioxidant capacity of raspberry extract and the protective effect on liver injury induced by ConA in mice were investigated. Balb/C male mice were randomly divided into six groups: normal group,model group,bicyclol control group( 200 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)),low-dose raspberry extract group( 200 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)),middle-dose raspberry extract group( 400 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)),and highdose raspberry extract group( 800 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)). Each group was intragastrically administered with drugs according to the body weight once a day. Seven days later,all of the groups except for the normal group were treated with ConA( 20 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)) through tail vein injection to establish the acute liver injury model. The mice were put to death 8 hours later. The organ indexes were calculated. These rum levels of ALT,AST and LDH and the activities of SOD,CAT,GSH and MDA in liver tissue were detected. HE staining was used to observe the pathological changes of liver tissue in mice. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of Bax,Bcl-2,Nrf2 and Keap-1. The antioxidant capacity of raspberry extract was measured by CAA assay. The results showed that,raspberry extract had a strong antioxidant capacity. Simultaneously,compared with the model group,raspberry extract can significantly improve the pathological conditions of liver,and significantly reduce ALT,AST and LDH activities in serum of liver injury mice( P<0. 01). The activities of SOD,CAT in liver homogenate supernatant were significantly increased in the high-dose group,the content of GSH increased,while the content of MDA was sharply declined in the high-dose group( P<0. 01). Meanwhile,raspberry extract down-regulated the expressions of Bax and Keap-1 and up-regulated the expressions of Bcl-2 and Nrf2. CAA showed that the compound raspberry extract had a strong antioxidant capacity. Therefore,raspberry extract has an obvious protective effect on acute liver injury induced by ConA in mice.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a major effector of various diseases; accordingly, antioxidants are frequently ingested in order to prevent or alleviate disease symptoms. Kimchi contains various natural antioxidants, and it is known that the functional activity varies depending on the ingredients and fermentation state. Black raspberries (BR) contain various bioactive compounds with antioxidant effects. This study investigated the antioxidant and liver-protection effects of kimchi supplemented with black raspberry juice powder (BJP).\nBJP-added kimchi (BAK; at 0.5%, 1%, and 2% concentrations of BJP) and control (without BJP) were prepared and fermented at 4\u2103 for 4 weeks. Changes in the antioxidant effects of BAK during fermentation were investigated. In addition, the protective activity of BAK against oxidative stress was investigated in a liver cirrhosis-induced animal model \nBAK groups showed the acidity and pH of optimally ripened (OR) kimchi at 2 weeks of fermentation along with the highest lactic acid bacterial counts. Additionally, BAK groups displayed a higher content of phenolic compounds and elevated antioxidant activities relative to the control, with the highest antioxidant effect observed at 2 weeks of fermentation of OR 1% BAK. After feeding the OR 1% BAK to thioacetamide-induced liver cirrhosis rats, we observed decreased glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase activities and elevated superoxide dismutase activity.\nThese findings showed that the antioxidant effects of OR BAK and feeding of OR 1% BAK resulted in liver-protective effects against oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "One of the most critical aspects of chromatographic analysis is effective data acquisition and processing. Typical approaches include software platforms designed for specific instruments or commercial data acquisition hardware boards, both of which require expensive licenses to use and operate. To increase the access and affordability of chromatographic data acquisition, especially for systems in which software control has become obsolete or must be written in-house, an open-source digital stripchart recorder has been developed. This system is built upon a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and a plug-in printed circuit board with the necessary integrated circuits for data acquisition. Using an open-source software called Processing, a complete user interface to control the system was developed that enables the acquisition, filtering, and processing of chromatographic data. The system performs comparably to more expensive platforms, with calculated values for peak area, retention time, and plate count all within 3% of the values calculated by a widely used commercial chromatography data software package.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone is an important ingredient in the flavor and fragrance industries. Due to its low content in fruits and vegetables, the production of natural raspberry ketone using heterologous synthesis in microbial strains is recently attracting increased attention. In this work, a heterologous pathway to produce raspberry ketone from p-coumaric acid, including 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL), benzalacetone synthase (BAS), and raspberry ketone/zingerone synthase (RZS1) from plants, was successfully assembled in Escherichia coli. When the RZS1 gene was introduced into E. coli and co-expressed with two other genes, the intermediate 4-hydroxybenzylidene acetone in the pathway was almost completely transformed into a raspberry ketone. Substituting TB medium for M9 medium increased raspberry ketone titers by 3-4 times. Furthermore, the heterologous pathway was partitioned into two modules; module one produced p-coumaroyl-CoA from p-coumaric acid by 4CL, and module two produced raspberry ketone from coumaroyl-CoA by the action of BAS and RZS1. Optimizing the balanced expression of the two modules, it was shown that moderate expression of module one and high expression of module two was the best combination to enhance raspberry ketone production. The engineered strain CZ-8 reached 90.97\u00a0mg/l of raspberry ketone, which was 12 times higher than previously reported. In addition, the preferred approach of the heterologous pathway was related to the heterologous genes from different sources; for example, 4CL from Arabidopsis thaliana seemed to be more suitable for raspberry ketone production than that from Petroselinum crispum. This work paves an alternative way for future economic production of natural raspberry ketone.",

    "abstract": "Berry fruits are well known to contain large amounts of polyphenol compounds. Among them, flavan-3-ol derivatives are a group of secondary metabolism compounds currently attracting a great deal of attention owing to their health benefits. Not only the fruits, but also the leaves of raspberry plants, are highly esteemed for tea making around the world and are largely used for food. In this report, we discuss the results of our study on the effect of light and temperature on polyphenol accumulation in raspberry leaves. When raspberry was cultivated in a plant factory unit and light intensity, wavelength, and temperature were varied, the amount of total polyphenol increased under blue light. Quantitative determination of (+)-catechin, (\u207b)-epicatechin, procyanidin B4, flavan-3-ol trimer, which are flavan-3-ol derivatives, was carried out using HPLC, whereby we confirmed their increase under blue light. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed correlation between chalcone synthase (CHS) gene expression and the amounts of the compounds measured in the leaves.",

    "abstract": "Biogenic amines (BAs) are widely present in nearly all fermented foods and beverages, and excess consumption can cause adverse health effects. To prepare BA-free Korean black raspberry wine (BRW), four autochthonous starter yeast strains without hazardous BA synthesis activity were selected and their physiological and biochemical properties were examined. The selected strains were identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on 26S rDNA sequencing and microsatellite analysis. Molecular fingerprinting revealed that isolates were quite different from commercial wine yeast S. cerevisiae (52.4% similarity), but genetically relevant to commercial beer yeasts. The four S. cerevisiae strains produced over 10% ethanol during BRW fermentation. In addition, the fermented BRW with these strains showed higher levels of total flavonoids and similar antioxidant activity compared to the control sample. Potentially hazardous BAs that commonly occur in black raspberry extract (BRE) such as cadaverine, histamine, and spermidine were also not detected in the fermented BRW. Thus, we suggest that our strains are promising fermentation tools to ensure high quality and enhanced functionality in the production of BA-free BRW.",

Numerous reports have shown that natural products could demonstrate photochemopreventive efficacy against UVB damage. We investigated the preventive effects and associated molecular mechanisms of red raspberry extract upon UVB-caused damage in human epidermal keratinocytes and a nude mouse model. The protein profiles and immunohistological study on a nude mouse skin indicated that red raspberry extract could prevent UVB-caused cell death and protect the skin against UVB-exposed injury manifested by wrinkling, scaling, tanning, and water loss as well as epidermal thickening. In addition, red raspberry extract application effectively abolished oxidative damage in DNA and attenuated the carbonylation level of proteins, which attributed to the activation of SOD, Nrf2 and its target genes, and HO-1. Red raspberry extract also altered the cells' apoptotic signaling pathways including caspase-3 as well as the inflammatory cascade such as c-jun and attenuated UVB-induced activation of NF-",

    "abstract": "Melon fly, Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett), is a serious pest of tropical horticulture, causing damage to cucurbits, other fruiting vegetables, and certain tree fruits. The deployment of male lures comprises an important component of several detection and control strategies for this pest, with the main male attractant currently in use being cuelure (CL). A novel fluorinated analog of CL, raspberry ketone trifluoroacetate (RKTA), has been developed for the control of Bactrocera tryoni, a related pest; here, we test this compound for attraction to Z. cucurbitae. In outdoor screen cage testing, observations showed both more flies on filter papers, and a higher percentage of flies feeding, on papers treated with RKTA than on those with CL or melolure (ML). Field trapping with both yellow sticky traps and bucket traps found that RKTA captured more flies during the first 6 h of trapping than CL, while trap captures in the subsequent 18 h did not differ between the two lures. When comparing combined 24 h trap captures, yellow sticky traps containing RKTA captured more flies than those with CL, while bucket trap captures did not vary by lure. Analysis of lures weathered on filter paper found that nearly all applied RKTA hydrolyzed to RK within 6 h. Fine-scale melon fly behaviors digitally recorded in the field showed median resting distances from the lure of responding flies were shorter for RKTA than for CL. This study demonstrates the inherent attractiveness of RKTA while also highlighting the instability of this compound due to hydrolysis.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has led to an intense interest in developing its inhibitors as anti-diabetes, anti-obesity and anti-cancer agents. The fruits of Rubus chingii (Chinese raspberry) were used as a kind of dietary traditional Chinese medicine. The methanolic extract of R. chingii fruits exhibited significant PTP1B inhibitory activity. Further bioactivity-guided fractionation resulted in the isolation of three PTP1B inhibitory ursane-type triterpenes: ursolic acid (1), 2-oxopomolic acid (2), and 2\u03b1, 19\u03b1-dihydroxy-3-oxo-urs-12-en-28-oic acid (3). Kinetics analyses revealed that 1 was a non-competitive PTP1B inhibitor, and 2 and 3 were mixed type PTP1B inhibitors. Compounds 1-3 and structurally related triterpenes (4-8) were further analyzed the structure-activity relationship, and were evaluated the inhibitory selectivity against four homologous protein tyrosine phosphatases (TCPTP, VHR, SHP-1 and SHP-2). Molecular docking simulations were also carried out, and the result indicated that 1, 3-acetoxy-urs-12-ene-28-oic acid (5), and pomolic acid-3\u03b2-acetate (6) bound at the allosteric site including \u03b13, \u03b16, and \u03b17 helix of PTP1B.",

    "abstract": "Sixty percent of the $109 million processed red raspberry industry of the United States occurs in northern Washington State. In 2012, late-summer symptoms of vascular wilt and root disease were observed in many raspberry plantings. These symptoms were initially attributed to Verticillium dahliae. However, diagnostic tests for the pathogen were often contradictory and other soilborne pathogens (Phytophthora rubi and Pratylenchus penetrans) or Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) might also have been involved. Therefore, a survey was conducted in 2013 and 2014 to (i) establish the incidence and soil population levels of V. dahliae in red raspberry production fields, (ii) compare among diagnostic methods and laboratories for detecting and quantifying V. dahliae from raspberry field soil, and (iii) assess which pathogens are associated with late-summer disease symptoms of raspberry. Plant and soil samples were collected from 51 disease sites and 20 healthy sites located in 24 production fields. Samples were analyzed for the presence and quantity of each pathogen using traditional plating and extraction methods (V. dahliae, P. rubi, and P. penetrans), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (V. dahliae and P. rubi), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (RBDV). Results showed that V. dahliae was present in 88% of the production fields and that detection of the pathogen differed by method and by laboratory: qPCR detected V. dahliae in the soil from approximately three times as many sites (51 of 71 total sites) as by plating on NP10 semi-selective medium (15 of 71 total sites). Soil populations of V. dahliae were slightly greater at disease sites, but the pathogen was detected with similar frequency from healthy sites and it was rarely isolated from diseased plants (4%). P. rubi, P. penetrans, and RBDV were also common in production fields (79, 91, and 53% of fields, respectively). Both P. rubi (soil and root samples) and P. penetrans (root populations only), but not RBDV, were more frequently found at disease sites than healthy sites, and the amount of P. rubi detected by qPCR was greater from disease sites than healthy sites. In addition, P. rubi was isolated from 27% of the symptomatic plants located at disease sites. Regardless of detection method, V. dahliae, P. rubi, and P. penetrans, either with or without RBDV, were more likely to co-occur at disease sites (73%) than healthy sites (35%), suggesting that a soilborne disease complex is present in raspberry production fields. Results indicate that P. rubi is the primary pathogen most strongly associated with late-summer symptoms of disease, but root populations of P. penetrans and higher soil populations of V. dahliae may also be of concern. Therefore, disease control methods should focus on all three soilborne pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Tephritid fruit flies are recognized as the most economically important insect pest group, causing significant losses to horticultural crops globally. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is used to suppress or eradicate pest fruit flies in many countries. The provisioning of adult dietary or olfactory supplementation pre-release is commonly used to improve the mating performance of sterile male flies in SIT. This study on a major pest species, Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt), focused on improving mating performance by providing a semiochemical, raspberry ketone (RK), in the pre-release adult diet.\nSurvival was numerically higher for RK-supplemented males. Sexual maturity occurred 1\u2009day earlier (from 7 to 6\u2009days) in RK-supplemented sterile males. The mating latency period decreased with maturation age and was lower for RK-fed males. RK-supplemented sterile males increasingly mated with fertile females as they aged (10-19\u2009days). The mating competitiveness of both RK-supplemented sterile males and RK-denied sterile males was greater than that of wild males.\nThe early sexual maturity and increased mating performance of RK-supplemented sterile males indicate that the effectiveness of SIT programmes can be increased through dietary supplementation with RK during the pre-release period. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "abstract": "Berries are known for their antioxidant activity due to the presence of flavonoids. Antioxidants' usage guarantees skin protection against free radicals and, flavonoids, especially, can act as sunscreen. The aim of this paper was to evaluate solar protection factor (SPF) and antioxidant activity in vitro of blackberry and raspberry extracts incorporated in topical formulation and study their stability.\nRaspberry presented 29.93\u00a0mg of anthocyanins/100\u00a0g of fruit and blackberry 65.58\u00a0mg of anthocyanins/100\u00a0g of fruit. In vitro solar protection factor was 54.57 to blackberry and 37.32 to raspberry. When incorporated in O/W emulsions, final formulations showed light pink color, creamy aspect, and typical fruity odor. Formulations submitted to indirect light and stove showed odor and color alterations.\nBased on the results, formulations containing extracts should be kept under refrigeration in opaque package to ensure stability due to the presence of flavonoids. In addition, blackberry and raspberry extracts are potential natural alternatives to be used as sunscreen and to prevent skin aging.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a continually growing pandemic leading to many diseases that affect the overall quality of life. The widely marketed Garcinia cambogia (GC) and Raspberry ketone (RK) were used in this study. Despite their known dietetic effect, however, the metabolomic/signaling pathways involved in this effect are not fully elucidated. Hence, our study comprehends the possible trajectories of their combination against obesity and insulin resistance in addition to exploring their combination merit.\nAdult male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups; viz., normal diet (ND), high fat fructose diet (HFFD), HFFD+GC (600mg/kg), HFFD+RK (55mg/kg) and HFFD+GC+RK. To assess our aim, we determined their effect on body weight, IPGTT, glucose homeostasis (glucose, insulin, HOMA IR), lipid profile parameters and SREBP-1c, oxidative stress markers, insulin and leptin signaling pathways (p-IRS-1/p-AKT/GLUT-4, and leptin/STAT-3), as well as liver and adipose tissue histopathology.\nGC/RK combinationcaused weight loss, corrected the disturbed glucose and insulin homeostasis, raised serum levels of HDL anddecreased all other lipid profile parameters. They also increased Nrf-2 expression, ad GSH, as well as p-IRS-1/p-Akt/GLUT-4 cue, while they decreased MDA, leptin/STAT-3 and SREBP-1c content compared to the HFFD group. Furthermore, the GC/RK combination abolished apoptosis, fatty changes and inflammation in hepatocytes and decreased sclerotic blood vessels and congestion in adipose tissue.\nOur study highlights the involvement ofp-IRS-1/p-Akt/GLUT-4, leptin/STAT-3 and SREBP-1c signaling trajectories in the beneficial combination of GC and RK, besides, the efficient rebalance of the redox status, insulin resistance and tissue fat deposition confirmed histopathologically.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry and strawberry are high value-added food products that can contribute to human health due to the abundance of polyphenols that they contain. Polyphenols are secondary metabolites and therefore devoted to improve plant adaptation, these polyphenol profile can be induced applying different stimuli, such as certain bacteria. The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to evaluate the ability of two bacterial strains to modulate secondary metabolisms in strawberry and raspberry, and (ii) to explore the ability of plant extracts to modify enzyme activities related to metabolic syndrome.\nTotal phenolic and anthocyanin content was higher in strawberries than in raspberries, despite similar antioxidant capacities. Strawberry extracts performed better on the tested enzymes, except on \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition capacity. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens stabilized the effects of extracts at different points in time, and Pseudomonas fluorescens modified plant metabolism after more inoculations (spring) in both species, improving the effects of raspberry extracts on \u03b1-glucosidase, COX1, and COX2, and of strawberry on \u03b1-amylase and COX1.\nIt is good to include these two fruits in the diet because they improve the activity of metabolic syndrome-related enzymes. Applying either strain during plant growth modifies the bioactive profile of the plants, improving the effects of the fruit extracts on human health. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is faced with challenges that require green solutions and energy-efficient paradigms. Architectures (such as ARM) have evolved significantly in recent years, with improvements to processor efficiency, essential for always-on devices, as a focal point. However, as far as software is concerned, few approaches analyse the advantages of writing efficient code when programming IoT devices. Therefore, this proposal aims to improve source code optimization to achieve better execution times. In addition, the importance of various techniques for writing efficient code for Raspberry Pi devices is analysed, with the objective of increasing execution speed. A complete set of tests have been developed exclusively for analysing and measuring the improvements achieved when applying each of these techniques. This will raise awareness of the significant impact the recommended techniques can have.",

    "abstract": "A product translated from the 1b gene of raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) was specifically detected in RBDV-infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants by immunoblot analysis. To analyze the effects of the 1b gene on virus infection in host plants, an RBDV deletion mutant virus (RB\u22061bstop), which is unable to express the 1b gene, was constructed and inoculated to N. benthamiana plants. The results showed that accumulation of the virus genomic (g) RNAs 1 and 2 decreased in inoculated leaves, and that systemic virus spread was delayed compared with wild-type RBDV. In contrast, accumulation of the viral gRNAs 1 and 2 was elevated in RB\u22061bstop-infected leaf tissues during ectopic expression of the 1b gene. Furthermore, we found that the 1b has weak RNA silencing suppressor activity.",

    "abstract": "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1) controls the lipid and glucose metabolism and also affects inflammation, cell proliferation and apoptosis during cardiovascular disease. Raspberry ketone (RK) is a red raspberry (Rubusidaeus, Family-Rosaceae) plant constituent, which activates PPAR-\u03b1. This study was conducted to assess the cardioprotective action of RK against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiotoxicity. Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups (six rats/group). Rats were orally administered with RK (50, 100 and 200\u202fmg/kg, respectively) and fenofibrate (standard, 80\u202fmg/kg) for 28 days and ISO was administered (85\u202fmg/kg, subcutaneously) on 27th and 28th day. Administration of ISO in rats significantly altered hemodynamic and electrocardiogram patterns, total antioxidant capacity, PPAR-\u03b1, and apolipoprotein C-III levels. These myocardial aberrations were further confirmed during infarct size, heart weight to body weight ratio and immunohistochemical assessments (caspase-3 and nuclear factor-\u03baB). RK pretreatment (100 and 200\u202fmg/kg) significantly protected rats against oxidative stress, inflammation, and dyslipidemia caused by ISO as demonstrated by change in hemodynamic, biochemical and histological parameters. The results so obtained were quite comparable with fenofibrate. Moreover, RK was found to have binding affinity with PPAR-\u03b1, as confirmed by docking analysis. PPAR-\u03b1 expression and concentration was also found increased in presence of RK which gave impression that RK probably showed cardioprotection via PPAR-\u03b1 activation, however direct binding study of RK with PPAR-\u03b1 is needed to confirm this assumption.",

    "abstract": "As important epigenetic regulators, microRNA regulate protein expression by triggering the degradation of target mRNA and/or by inhibiting their translation. Dysregulation of microRNA expression has been reported in several cancers, including colorectal cancer. In this study, microRNA-array differential analysis revealed strongly enhanced expression of miR-24-1-5p in the colon tissue of azoxymethane/dextran sulphate sodium-induced mice that were fed with black raspberry anthocyanins for 9 weeks. Overexpression of miR-24-1-5p in human colorectal cancer cells significantly repressed \u03b2-catenin expression, and simultaneously decreased cell proliferation, migration and survival. Furthermore, miR-24-1-5p could target \u03b2-catenin and trigger a negative regulatory loop for \u03b2-catenin and its downstream target genes. \u03b2-Catenin signalling is vital to the formation and progression of human colorectal cancer. The current findings therefore identified miR-24-1-5p as a potent regulator of \u03b2-catenin, and this may provide a novel chemopreventive and therapeutic strategy for \u03b2-catenin signalling-driven colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Clinical and laboratory studies have implicated black raspberries (BRBs) and their associated phytochemicals in the modulation of several chronic diseases. Most research on the health benefits of BRBs is conducted using freeze-dried or otherwise minimally processed products, yet BRBs are typically consumed as thermally processed goods like jams and syrups. The objective of this work was to profile the chemical changes that result from thermal processing of BRB powder into a nectar beverage. Using an untargeted UHPLC-QTOF-MS metabolomics approach, key degradation products of anthocyanins were identified along with several other proposed phenolic degradants. The effects of processing on other key BRB compound groups, including ellagitannins, are also discussed. This work demonstrates the utility of an untargeted metabolomics approach in describing the chemistry of complex food systems and provides a foundation for future research on the impact of processing on BRB product bioactivity.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry has been well-known for its nutritional purpose. Although this fruit has been reported for its potent antioxidant activity and health-promoting properties, systematic studies responsible for the bioactive constituents were still insufficient. In the current study, three pairs of dihydrobenzofuran-type enantiomeric neolignans (1a/1b-3a/3b), including two new compounds (1b and 2a), were isolated from the fruit of Rubus idaeus. The structures of these enantiomers were determined through spectroscopic methods and quantum mechanical calculations. Biologically, enantiomers 2a and 2b exhibited significant enantioselective protective effects against H",

    "abstract": "Raspberry and blueberry pomace, by-products from fruit juice industry, were dehydrated to obtain fruit fiber concentrates and valorized as ingredients in gluten-free (GF) cookies formulation. The aim was to evaluate the effect of substituting 30% (w/w) of GF flour mixture with different ratios of blueberry/raspberry fiber concentrates (0/30, 15/15, and 30/0) on rheological properties of cookie dough and cookie baking quality. Generally, the incorporation of the fiber concentrates increased the elastic and the viscous moduli thus producing harder doughs and consequently firmer cookies in comparison to the control. Although having similar total, soluble and insoluble fiber content, blueberry fiber concentrates were characterized with higher water absorption capacity and consequently yielded cookies with more rigid dough structure, higher water loss during baking, lower cookie thickness, higher spread ratio, more dense inner structure, and increased cookie hardness than those containing raspberry fiber concentrates. Enrichment of GF cookies with raspberry and blueberry fiber concentrates resulted in products with dietary fiber content higher than 6 g per 100\u2009g, thus making them candidates for bearing \"high fiber\" nutrition claim. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Currently available GF bakery products mostly lack dietary fibers (DFs) and other important nutrients, because they are usually manufactured from refined flour and/or starches. As the products with long shelf-life, very popular in daily diet of almost all consumer profiles, cookies could represent good matrices for the addition of functional ingredients, such as DFs. In this paper, GF cookies were enriched with the fiber concentrates recovered from blueberry and raspberry pomace. Application of these fiber sources enabled recycling of fruit processing industry by-products into novel, \"high fiber\" GF product with improved nutritive profile.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a proven risk factor for neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulating evidences suggested that nutritional interventions provide potential for prevention and treatment of AD. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of dietary treatment of obese rats with natural Raspberry ketone (RK) and their relationship with neurodegeneration. Obesity was first induced in 40 male Wistar rats (140-160\u2009g) by feeding high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Obese rats were then assigned into 4 groups (n\u2009=\u200910 each). (O-AD) is obese induced AD group maintained on HFD for another 6 weeks. OCR is obese group received calorie restricted diet for 6 weeks. OCRRK is obese group received calorie restricted diet and RK (44\u2009mg/kg body weight, daily, orally) for 6 weeks and OCRD is obese group received calorie restricted diet and orlistate (10\u2009mg/kg body weight, daily orally) for 6 weeks. Another 10 normal rats received normal diet were used as normal control group (NC). Body weight, visceral white adipose tissue weight (WAT), lipid profile, oxidative stress markers, adiponectin, cholinergic activity and amyloid extracellular plaques were examined. In addition to histological changes in brain tissues were evaluated.Raspberry ketone (RK) via its antioxidant properties attenuated oxidative damage and dyslipidemia in O-AD group. It inhibited acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AchE) and hence increased acetylcholine level (Ach) in brain tissues of O-AD rats. It is also impeded the upregulation of beta-secretase-1 (BACE-1) and the accumulation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques which crucially involved in AD. The combination of CR diet with RK was more effective than CR diet with orlistate (antiobese drug) in abrogating the neurodegenerative changes induced by obesity. Results from this study suggested that concomitant supplementation of RK with calorie restricted regimen effectively modulate the neurodegenerative changes induced by obesity and delay the progression of AD.",

    "abstract": "The red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is a common fruit worldwide and its extract has been found to inhibit the growth of many types of tumors, mainly because it is rich in bioactive phytochemicals. However, the mechanism underlying its anticancer activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well understood. Herein, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of red raspberry phytochemicals on the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and to elucidate its biochemical and molecular targets. CCK8 and colony formation, as well as flow cytometry assays, were employed to determine the effects of red raspberry extract (RRE) on cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution in HCC cells. Our results showed that RRE significantly inhibited cell proliferation and arrested cell cycle progression at the S phase in HCC cells. RRE increased the expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) by reducing the methylation status of the PTEN gene promoter and inhibiting DNMT1 expression and regulated AKT signaling pathway. These findings show that red raspberry phytochemicals inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells by regulating PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, providing evidence that RRE may be used as a potential auxiliary therapy for patients with HCC.",

    "abstract": "Aqueous colloidal suspensions, both man-made and natural, are part of our everyday life. The applicability of colloidal suspensions, however, is limited by the range of conditions over which they are stable. Here we report a novel type of highly monodisperse raspberry-like colloids, which are prepared in a single-step synthesis that relies on simultaneous dispersion and emulsion polymerisation. The resulting raspberry colloids behave almost like hard spheres. In aqueous solutions, such prepared raspberries show unexpected stability against aggregation over large variations of added salt concentrations without addition of stabilisers. We present simple Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) calculations performed on raspberry-like and smooth colloids showing that this stability results from our raspberries' unique morphology, which extends our understanding of colloidal stability against salting. Further, the raspberries' stability facilitates the formation of superspheres and thin films in which the raspberry colloids self-assemble into hexagonally close-packed photonic crystals with exquisite reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Candida spp., especially Candida albicans, is one of the main colonisers of the oral cavity. Due to its ability to form biofilms, it can be implicated in dental caries, periodontal disease and denture stomatitis. Microbial cells in biofilms are minimally impacted by conventional drugs. The aim of this study was to find new substances able to inhibit the adhesion of Candida spp. in order to prevent biofilm formation in the oral cavity. This study focused on the red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) fruit, known for its richness in potentially antimicrobial tannins. Extraction with a polarity gradient was performed on acetone extracts from frozen ripe and unripe fruits, resulting in eight extracts. The antifungal and anti-adhesion effects of the extracts were determined using broth microdilution and XTT methods, respectively, against C. albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis strains. Interestingly, four extracts (hexane and ethyl acetate) displayed anti-adhesion activity against C. albicans at low concentrations [50% inhibitory concentration (IC",

    "abstract": "A three-dimensional magnetic hollow porous raspberry-like hierarchical Co/Ni@carbon microspheres (3D Co/Ni@carbon) were synthesized by using a bimetal-organic framework (Co/Ni-MOF) as a precursor and subsequent calcination under nitrogen. The 3D Co/Ni@carbon is a novel solid phase extractant that displays outstanding extraction capability and separation efficiency for the pyrethroid pesticides ethofenprox and bifenthrin. This is ascribed to the beneficial effects of facile analyte transport (due to the presence of free pores), the abundant number of adsorption sites (which warrant efficient extraction), and the excellent structural stability of the material. The 3D Co/Ni@carbon was applied to dispersive magnetic solid-phase extraction (d-MSPE), and the two pyrethroids were quantified by HPLC (UV detection wavelength: 220\u00a0nm). The method has a high preconcentration factor (937-1012) and give recoveries that range between 85.6-106.9%, with RSDs (for n\u2009=\u20095) of <6% in case of real samples.

    "abstract": "Unlike many other rosaceous fruit crops, commercial raspberry cultivars are largely self-fertile and mostly self-pollinate autogamously. However, their floral morphology does not allow for complete autopollination, which often yields unmarketable small or crumbly fruits. Insect visitation is therefore essential to maximize raspberry production. Honey bees are typically used to pollinate commercial raspberries, but escalating prices for hive rentals coupled with increasing acreage encourages evaluation of other manageable pollinators. Four other manageable bee taxa-various Bombus spp., Osmia lignaria Say, Osmia aglaia Sandhouse, and Osmia bruneri Cockerell-are all promising raspberry pollinators. Because honey bees remain the least expensive option on a per forager basis, adoption of an alternative pollinator should entail some other advantage, such as superior pollination efficacy. In this study, we compared honey bees with these other bee species for their pollination efficacies at red raspberries, measured as the number of drupelets resulting from a single visit to a virgin flower. Each species' single-visit pollination efficacy was also compared with drupelet set from both unvisited and hand-pollinated flowers, and their pollination effectiveness scores were calculated. All five bee species were equally effective raspberry pollinators; therefore, honey bees remain the most cost effective option for open field pollination of raspberry. Mason bees and bumble bees may have greater utility during cool weather or for protected cultivation systems, contexts unfavorable to honey bee foraging.",

    "abstract": "The changing climate is altering timing of key fruit ripening processes and increasing the occurrence of fruit defects. To improve our understanding of the genetic control of raspberry fruit development an enhanced genetic linkage map was developed and used to examine ripening phenotypic data.\nIn this study we developed an enhanced genetic linkage map for the raspberry cvs. Glen Moy x Latham reference mapping population using genotyping by sequencing (GbS). Alignment to a newly sequenced draft reference genome of red raspberry, cultivar (cv.) Glen Moy, identified 8019 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). After stringent filtering to take account of read coverage over all the progeny individuals, association with a single chromosome, heterozygosity and marker regression mapping, 2348 high confidence SNPs were retained and integrated with an existing raspberry genetic map. The linkage map contained many more SNPs segregating in Latham than in Glen Moy. This caused difficulties in quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping with standard software and a novel analysis based on a hidden Markov model was used to improve the mapping. QTL mapping using the newly generated dense genetic map not only corroborated previously identified genetic locations but also provided additional genetic elements controlling fruit ripening in raspberry.\nThe high-density GbS map located the QTL peaks more precisely than in earlier studies, aligned the QTLs with Glen Moy genome scaffolds, narrowed the range of potential candidate genes to these regions that can be utilised in other populations or in gene expression studies to confirm their role and increased the repertoire of markers available to understand the genetic control of fruit ripening traits.",

    "abstract": "The fragmented nature of most draft plant genomes has hindered downstream gene discovery, trait mapping for breeding, and other functional genomics applications. There is a pressing need to improve or finish draft plant genome assemblies.\nHere, we present a chromosome-scale assembly of the black raspberry genome using single-molecule real-time Pacific Biosciences sequencing and high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) genome scaffolding. The updated V3 assembly has a contig N50 of 5.1 Mb, representing an \u223c200-fold improvement over the previous Illumina-based version. Each of the 235 contigs was anchored and oriented into seven chromosomes, correcting several major misassemblies. Black raspberry V3 contains 47 Mb of new sequences including large pericentromeric regions and thousands of previously unannotated protein-coding genes. Among the new genes are hundreds of expanded tandem gene arrays that were collapsed in the Illumina-based assembly. Detailed comparative genomics with the high-quality V4 woodland strawberry genome (Fragaria vesca) revealed near-perfect 1:1 synteny with dramatic divergence in tandem gene array composition. Lineage-specific tandem gene arrays in black raspberry are related to agronomic traits such as disease resistance and secondary metabolite biosynthesis.\nThe improved resolution of tandem gene arrays highlights the need to reassemble these highly complex and biologically important regions in draft plant genomes. The updated, high-quality black raspberry reference genome will be useful for comparative genomics across the horticulturally important Rosaceae family and enable the development of marker assisted breeding in Rubus.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory potential of crude extracts (CE), anthocyanin-rich fractions (ARF), and phenolic fractions (PF) from raspberry (R) and raspberry juice (J) were evaluated. The antioxidant properties were evaluated with three complementary assays: DPPH radical scavenging activity, chelating Fe(II) power, and ferric reducing power. The highest antioxidant activity was determined for the crude extract from raspberry pulp (RCE) in the case of all methods used. The anti-inflammatory activity was demonstrated by inhibitory effect on lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity in vitro. The highest efficiency in inhibiting the activity of both enzymes was exhibited by RCE, 0.79 and 0.59 mg FW/mL, respectively. In turn, JARF had the lowest ability to inhibit LOX (EC50 = 4.5 mg FW/mL) and JPF caused the lowest COX-2 inhibition (1.75 mg FW/mL). Additionally, we have performed a pilot study of in vitro cytotoxic activity using two human leukemia cell lines: J45 and HL60. All examined extracts inhibited the viability of J45 cells more effectively than HL60. The highest cytotoxic effect was observed in the J45.01 cell line after exposure to RCE (EC50 = 0.0375 mg FW/mL).",

    "abstract": "Pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest black raspberries (BRBs) may inhibit the development of oral cancer. Lyophilized BRB powder is commonly used in these studies, but processed BRB products are more often consumed. The objective of this work was to understand how storage conditions influence the phytochemical profile and anti-proliferative activity of a BRB nectar beverage. Untargeted UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS based metabolomics analyses demonstrated that large chemical variation was introduced by storage above -20 \u00b0C over 60 days. However, minimal change in anti-proliferative activity was observed when stored nectar extracts were applied to SCC-83-01-82 premalignant oral epithelial cells. As proof of concept, cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside and its degradation product, protocatechuic acid, were administered in different ratios maintaining an equimolar dose, and anti-proliferative activity was maintained. This study shows the utility of metabolomics to profile global chemical changes in foods, while demonstrating that isolated phytochemicals do not explain the complete bioactivity of a complex food product.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effect of \u03b1-linolenic acid-rich black raspberry seed (BRS) oil on lipid metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese and db/db mice. Five-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed diets consisting of 50% calories from lard, 5% from soybean, and 5% from corn oil (HFD), or 50% calories from lard and 10% from BRS oil (HFD + BRS oil diet) for 12 weeks. Six-week-old C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were fed diets consisting of 16% calories from soybean oil (standard diet), 8% from soybean, and 8% from BRS oil, or 16% from BRS oil for 10 weeks. The BRS oil diets lowered the levels of triacylglycerol, nonesterified fatty acids, and total cholesterol in serum and liver of both of the obese and db/db mice as compared with the HFD and standard diet, respectively. mRNA levels of lipogenesis markers including cluster of differentiation 36, fatty-acid-binding protein 1, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c, fatty-acid synthase, and solute carrier family 25 member 1 in the liver of the BRS oil groups were lower than those in the liver of the HFD and standard groups in the obese and db/db mice, respectively. On the other hand, fatty-acid oxidation markers including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, hydroxylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase \u03b1, and acyl-CoA oxidase in the liver of the BRS oil groups were higher than those in the liver of the HFD and standard groups in the obese and db/db mice, respectively. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 mRNA and protein levels increased in the liver and epididymal adipose tissue of the obese and db/db mice fed BRS oil compared with HFD and standard diet, respectively. BRS oil might improve lipid metabolism by inhibiting lipogenesis and promoting fatty-acid oxidation in HFD-induced obese and db/db mice.",

    "abstract": "Impedance Cardiography (ICG) is a non-invasive method for monitoring cardiac dynamics using Electrical Bioimpedance (EBI) measurements. Since its appearance more than 40 years ago, ICG has been used for assessing hemodynamic parameters. This paper present a measurement system based on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing both a full 3-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a platform supporting Do-It-Yourself project and education applications across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933. The recording were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC, where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely available and affordable components, for supporting developers in research and engineering education. The design and development documents, will be available on www.BiosignalPI.com, for open access under a Non Commercial-Share A like 4.0 International License.",

    "abstract": "We created an auto-para viewer, an autofluorescence imaging device, to localize the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy using an inexpensive Raspberry Pi. A special emission filter in the auto-para viewer was designed to pass 1/100 of visible light and nearly all infrared light longer than 808 nm. With this emission filter, we simultaneously acquired an autofluorescence image of the parathyroid and a visible light image of the surrounding surgical field. The auto-para viewer displayed four times brighter autofluorescence of the parathyroid glands compared to the background tissues without operating room light. Additionally, it showed two times brighter autofluorescence than the background tissues simultaneously showing the surgical field illuminated by the visible light from the operating room light. The NOIR camera, using the auto-para viewer, could reduce the camera's exposure time so the parathyroid glands to be viewed in real-time, which is expected to prevent unintentional damage to the parathyroid gland during thyroidectomy.",

    "abstract": "Chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes photo-oxidation, which in turn results in the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and loss of collagen. Rubus idaeus L. (RI), also called red raspberry, is an important cash crop that contains abundant antioxidant compounds. Sanguiin H-6 and lambertianin C are the major ingredients presented in the extracts. Here, we studied the protective effect of RI on UVB-induced photoaging in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). We found that RI notably reduced UVB-induced MMPs secretion and pro-inflammatory mediators production, and significantly suppressed UVB-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-\u03ba\u03b2, as well as activator protein 1. Additionally, treatment of NHDFs with the ERK inhibitor (PD98059) and JNK inhibitor (SP600125) resulted in the reduction of UVB-induced MMP-1 and IL-6 expressions, which demonstrated that the inhibition of MMP-1 and IL-6 by RI is associated with the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, we also found that RI accelerated procollagen type I synthesis by activating the transforming growth factor-\u03b2/Smad pathway and enhanced the expression of cytoprotective antioxidants such as heme oxygenase-1 and NHD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 by promoting nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 nuclear transfer. Overall, these findings demonstrated that RI was potentially effective in preventing UVB induced skin photoaging.",

    "abstract": "The elaborate design of calcium phosphates (CaP) with a hierarchical structure for biomedical applications is severely restricted due to their instinctive pertinacious irregular agglomeration. Thus, the development of mesoporous CaP with large internal pores is far from satisfactory. In this study, catechol is selected as a modifier to intervene in the precipitation of CaP. Compared to pure CaP with smooth irregular aggregates with an average size of 110 nm, the catechol-intervened CaP (CaP/Cat) samples are raspberry-like nano-spherical assemblies of ca. 25 nm nanoparticles. The obtained spheres possess a mesoporous structure, large interior pores and high specific surface area, which endow them with a high protein adsorption capacity and high DNA delivery efficacy. Catechol is subjected to oxidative polymerization while CaP precipitation occurs. This simultaneous reaction is supposed to play a crucial role in directing the assembling of the CaP/Cat nanospheres. The flexible catechol moiety is shown to be a novel and promising modifier for manufacturing CaP with tunable structures and properties for various applications.",

    "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis causes recurring intestinal mucosal injury and sustained inflammation, increasing the likelihood of colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Dietary red raspberry (RB) is a rich source of phytonutrients known to have anti-inflammatory activity; however, the role of RB on CRC prevention in chronic colitis has not been examined.\nThis study examined the effects of dietary RB supplementation on inflammation, epithelium repair, and oncogenic signaling in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis in mice.\nSix-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control or RB (5% of dry feed weight; n\u00a0=\u00a012/group) diet for 10 wk. Starting from the fourth week, mice were administered 2 repeated cycles of 1% DSS (7-d DSS treatment plus 14-d recovery) and were monitored daily for disease activity index (DAI) score. Colonic tissues were collected at the end of the study for histochemical, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analysis of inflammation, differentiation and proliferation markers.\nRB supplementation reduced the DAI score and histologic damage (by 38.9%; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01), expression of inflammatory mediators (by 20-70%; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01), infiltration of CD4 T cells (by 50%; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05), and \u03b14\u03b27 integrin and related adhesion molecules (by 33.3%; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01). Furthermore, RB supplementation facilitated epithelium repair, as evidenced by enhanced goblet cell density, expression of transcription factors including Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) and Hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes1), terminal differentiation markers, mucin 2 (Muc2), and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (by 20-200%; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01). Conversely, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (by 70%; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01), \u03b2-catenin, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling (by 19-33%; P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) were reduced by RB supplementation. In addition, RB supplementation enhanced p53 stability (by 53%) and reduced oncogenic gene expression (by 50-60%).\nRB supplementation reduced DAI score and the risk of CRC development during recurring colitis in mice, suggesting that RB is a possible dietary supplement for patients with ulcerative colitis and related gut inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "The males of different species of Bactrocera and Zeugodacus fruit flies are commonly attracted to plant-derived phenylpropanoids (e.g. methyl eugenol (ME)) or phenylbutanoids (e.g. raspberry ketone (RK)) but almost never to both. However, one particular plant-derived phenylbutanoid, zingerone (ZN), which possesses an intermediate chemical structure between ME and RK, weakly attracts both ME- and RK-responding fruit fly species. Bactrocera jarvisi, an Australian fruit fly species, is weakly attracted to cue lure (an analogue of RK) but strongly attracted to ZN. Here, we investigated the minimum olfactory threshold and optimum sensitivity of B. jarvisi males to ZN and RK as a function of dose, time and sexual maturation. Our results show that B. jarvisi males had a marked preferential response to ZN, with a much lower olfactory threshold and faster response time to ZN than RK. Probit analysis demonstrated that ZN was at least >1600\u00d7 more potent than RK as a male attractant to B. jarvisi. Although fruit fly male attraction to the phytochemicals is generally associated with sexual maturity, in B. jarvisi immature males were also attracted to ZN. Our results suggest that B. jarvisi males have a fine-tuned olfactory response to ZN, which appears to play a central role in the chemical ecology of this species.",

    "abstract": "Botrytis cinerea, causal agent of gray mold, is one of the most important pathogens affecting raspberry in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and worldwide. Fungicides are currently applied to control the disease starting from 5 to 10% bloom and continuing on a calendar basis throughout the season rather than according to inoculum level or infection risk primarily because the disease cycle on red raspberry is poorly understood. Botrytis cinerea was isolated from raspberry flowers and fruit sampled at seven developmental stages during each of 2015 and 2016 in a northwestern Washington raspberry field untreated with fungicides. Incidence of colonization of flowers was low (15% of total sampled flowers), but increased as fruit developed, and peaked in mature fruit (67% of total sampled fruit). In the early stages of flower development, B. cinerea recovery was greatest from the carpel (80% of carpels colonized) compared with other floral organs. As fruit matured, additional floral parts were colonized by B. cinerea, possibly facilitating secondary internal or external infections of mature fruit. Average weekly minimum air temperature, average weekly night air temperature, cumulative rain, average weekly leaf wetness percentage, and duration of leaf wetness >90% were significantly positively correlated with B. cinerea colonization of raspberry in NW Washington during two seasons of this study. Our data does not support the hypothesis that the bloom period is the critical window for B. cinerea colonization of red raspberry and suggest that later colonization of developing fruit may be more important for gray mold development on raspberry. The outcomes of this research provide useful information for improvement of gray mold disease management strategies for red raspberry in NW Washington and elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "Raspberries are a rich source of ellagitannins and anthocyanins. The aim of this work was to investigate whether raspberry consumption can improve vascular function and to understand which phenolic metabolites may be responsible for the effects. A 3 arm double-blind randomized controlled crossover human intervention trial was conducted in 10 healthy males. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured at baseline, 2\u202fh, and 24\u202fh post-consumption of 200\u202fg and 400\u202fg of red raspberries containing 201 or 403\u202fmg of total (poly)phenols, or a matched control drink. Raspberry (poly)phenol metabolites were analyzed in plasma and urine by UPLC-QTOF mass spectrometry using authentic standards. Significant improvements in FMD were observed at 2\u202fh (1.6% (95%CI 1.2, 1.9) and 1.2% (95% CI 0.8, 1.5)) and 24\u202fh (1.0% (95% CI 0.6, 1.2) and 0.7% (95%CI 0.2, 0.9)) post-consumption of the 200 and 400\u202fg raspberry drinks as compared to control, respectively. Plasma ellagic acid, urolithin A-3-glucuronide and urolithin A-sulfate correlated with the improvements in FMD at 2 and 24\u202fh post consumption, respectively. Consumption of dietary achievable amounts of red raspberries acutely improves endothelial function up to 24\u202fh and ellagitannins may be responsible for the observed effect.",

    "abstract": "Obesity constitutes a major worldwide problem in which hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance represents adverse metabolic consequences of it. The present study was conducted to elucidate the role of raspberry ketones (RKs) in controlling body weight gain, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance in male obese rats through affecting the expression of various adipocytokines. As Aquaporin-7 is co-related with the expression of various adipocytokines and has recently emerged as a modulator of adipocyte metabolism, the present study evaluated the effect of RKs on adipose tissue expression of aquaporin-7(AQP7) in high-fat (HF) diet-fed rats. Groups of male rats were assigned to normal, HF diet-fed control rats and RKs-treated (250 and 500\u202fmg/kg) groups. RKs administration effectively abrogated hyperlipidemia and oxidative burden and enhanced insulin sensitivity. In addition, treatment with RKs ameliorated adipose tissue and liver indices and the reduced adipocyte diameters. Moreover, administration of the low dose of RKs ameliorated the expression of apelin and its receptor, and visfatin with upregulating adiponectin expression compared to HF diet control rats. However, both doses effectively downregulated leptin expression. It was obvious that both RKs doses revealed effectiveness in upregulating the AQP7 expression. The present data suggest the promising therapeutic role of RKs in HF diet-induced obesity that is likely attributable, at least in part, to upregulation of AQP7 expression.",

    "abstract": "Mesoporous materials with hierarchical morphologies have recently gained attention due to their structural versatility for various applications including catalysis, adsorption, energy storage and nanomedicine. However, it is still desirable for facilely controllable synthesis of mesoporous particles with tunable surface properties and oriented hierarchical structures. Here, we report a one-pot synthesis method for raspberry-like mesoporous silica nanospheres with 2 nm hollow silica nanoparticles doped on the surface. We identify that the control over the concentration of cationic surfactant and silica precursor can be used to control the multiple morphological evolutions of mesoporous silica nanoparticles. This control enables the fabrication of a diverse library of multi-compartment mesoporous silicas networks consist of mesoporous silica nanospheres connecting with mesoporous silica branches. The synthesis method would enable to synthesize hierarchical mesoporous silicas with complex architecture and different pore environments for the potential application in catalysis and nanomedicine.",

    "abstract": "Image-based phenomics is a powerful approach to capture and quantify plant diversity. However, commercial platforms that make consistent image acquisition easy are often cost-prohibitive. To make high-throughput phenotyping methods more accessible, low-cost microcomputers and cameras can be used to acquire plant image data.\nWe used low-cost Raspberry Pi computers and cameras to manage and capture plant image data. Detailed here are three different applications of Raspberry Pi-controlled imaging platforms for seed and shoot imaging. Images obtained from each platform were suitable for extracting quantifiable plant traits (e.g., shape, area, height, color) en masse using open-source image processing software such as PlantCV.\nThis protocol describes three low-cost platforms for image acquisition that are useful for quantifying plant diversity. When coupled with open-source image processing tools, these imaging platforms provide viable low-cost solutions for incorporating high-throughput phenomics into a wide range of research programs.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we prepared a novel composite based on hybrid gelatin carriers and montmorillonite clay (MMT) to analyze its viability as controlled drug delivery system. The objective of this research involves the characterization of composites formed by structured lipid-gelatin micro-particles (MP) and MMT clay. This analysis included the evaluation of the composite according to its rheological properties, morphology (SEM), particle size, XRD, FT-IR, and in vitro drug release. The effect of pH in the properties of the composite is evaluated. A novel raspberry-like or armor MP/MMT clay composite is reported, in which the pH has an important effect on the final structure of the composite for ad-hoc drug delivery systems. For pH values below the isoelectric point, we obtained defined morphologies with entrapment efficiencies up to 67%. The pH level controls the MP/MMT composite release mechanism, restringing drug release in the stomach-like environment. Intended for oral administration, these results evidence that the MP/MMT composite represents an attractive alternative for intestinal-colonic controlled drug delivery systems.",

    "abstract": "Spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae), is an invasive pest of soft-skinned fruits across the globe. Effective monitoring is necessary to manage this pest, but suitable attractants are still being identified. In this study, we combined lures with fermenting liquid baits to improve D. suzukii trapping specificity and attractiveness. We also measured the efficiency and specificity of baits/lures during different times of the season; the reproductive status of females among baits/lures; and the effects of locations and crop type on these response variables. We developed a metric that combined mating status and fat content to determine differences in types of females attracted. Lures utilizing yeast and sugar-based volatiles trapped the most D. suzukii. The addition of a commercial lure to yeast and sugar-based lures increased catches in most locations, but was also the least specific to D. suzukii. Apple juice-based chemical lures tended to be most specific to D. suzukii, while lures comprised of a singular attractant tended to trap more D. suzukii with a higher reproductive potential than combinations of attractants. Trap catch and lure specificity was lower during fruit development than fruit ripening. While catch amounts varied by geographic location and crop type, attractants performed similarly relative to each other in each location and crop. Based on the metrics in this study, the yeast and sugar-based attractants were the most effective lures. However, further work is needed to improve early season monitoring, elucidate the effects of physiological status on bait attraction, and understand how abiotic factors influence bait attraction.",

    "abstract": "Evidence indicates that raspberries have beneficial effects on chronic diseases. The objective of this study was to examine the beneficial effects of raspberry anthocyanin (RA) on high fat diet-induced obesity and investigate the underlying molecular mechanism. C57BL/6 mice were administered a low-fat diet, high-fat diet, and high-fat diet supplemented with RA at a dose of 200 mg kg-1 of food for 12 weeks. It was found that RA reduced the body weight gain by 63.7%. Furthermore, RA significantly elevated serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activities and fecal butyric acid level, remarkably reduced the serum and hepatic lipid profiles, and markedly down-regulated the expression of the tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) genes. Metabolomics analysis conducted using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) indicated that RA administration promoted the recovery of metabolites involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway, and glutathione metabolism in the livers of obese mice. These findings suggest that RA may ameliorate diet-induced obesity by alleviating oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Globally, agriculture increasingly depends on pollinators to produce many seed and fruit crops. However, what constitutes optimal pollination service for pollinator-dependent crops remains unanswered. We developed a simulation model to identify the optimal pollination service that maximizes fruit quality in crops. The model depicts the pollination (i.e., autonomous self-fertilization, pollen deposition) and post-pollination (i.e., pollen germination, and time from germination to ovule fertilization) processes leading to fruit and seed set and allows for negative flower-pollinator interactions, specifically pistil damage. We parameterized and validated the model based on empirical observations of commercial raspberry in western Argentina. To assess the effects of pollination intensity for fruit production, we conducted simulations over a range of visit number per flower by the two primary managed pollinators worldwide, Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris. Simulations identified that ~15-35 visits per flower by A.\u00a0mellifera or ~10-20 visits by B.\u00a0terrestris provide adequate pollination and maximize raspberry fruit quality (i.e., estimated as the proportion of ovules that develop into drupelets). Visits in excess of these optima reduce simulated fruit quality, and flowers receiving >670 honey bee visits or >470 bumble bee visits would produce fruits of poorer quality than those receiving no bee visits. The simulations generated consistent, unbiased predictions of fruit quality for 12 raspberry fields. This model could be adapted easily to other animal-pollinated crops and used to guide efficient pollinator management in any agro-ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberry extract (BRE) has been widely used for treating prostate and urinary diseases and hyperlipidemia in Asia due to its significant lipid-lowering effects. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the antihypercholesterolemia activity of BRE and the potential molecular mechanisms responsible for its antihypercholesterolemia activity by regulation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) expression in the human liver cell line HepG2. Reporter-based functional assay was used to identify herbal extracts that suppress PCSK9 expression in the HepG2 cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate whether BRE modulates low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression by repressing the hepatic expression of PCSK9. The LDLR activity of the HepG2 cells was determined using an LDL uptake assay. Our finding revealed that BRE modulates LDLR expression by suppressing the hepatic expression of PCSK9. We found that the combination of simvastatin and BRE caused the synergic induction of LDLR expression and LDL-C uptake, whereas simvastatin alone increased the expression of PCSK9 in the HepG2 cells. These results clearly demonstrated that the BRE from black raspberry suppressed simvastatin-induced PCSK9 expression and improved LDL-C uptake by hepatocytes through the induction of LDLR expression. These results suggest that the suppression of PCSK9 expression by BRE may potentiate the hypolipidemic effect of statins.",

    "abstract": "Supported catalysts are widely used in industry and can be optimized by tuning the composition, chemical structure, and interface of the nanoparticle catalyst and oxide support. Here we firstly combine a bottom up colloidal synthesis method with a top down atomic layer deposition (ALD) process to achieve a raspberry-like Pt-decorated Fe3O4 (Fe3O4-Pt) nanoparticle superlattices. This nanocomposite ensures the precision of the catalyst/support interface, improving the catalytic efficiency of the Fe3O4-Pt nanocomposite system. The morphology of the hybrid nanocomposites resulting from different cycles of ALD was monitored by scanning transmission electron microscopy, giving insight into the nucleation and growth mechanism of the ALD process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies confirm the anticipated electron transfer from Fe3O4 to Pt through the nanocomposite interface. Photocurrent measurement further suggests that Fe3O4 superlattices with controlled decoration of Pt have substantial promise for energy-efficient photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. This work opens a new avenue for designing supported catalyst architectures via precisely controlled decoration of single component superlattices with noble metals.",

    "abstract": "Development of brown and beige/brite adipocytes increases thermogenesis and helps to reduce obesity and metabolic syndrome. Our previous study suggests that dietary raspberry can ameliorate metabolic syndromes in diet-induced obese mice. Here, we further evaluated the effects of raspberry on energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis and determined whether these effects were mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Mice deficient in the catalytic subunit of AMPK\u03b11 and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD supplemented with 5% raspberry (RAS) for 10 weeks. The thermogenic program and related regulatory factors in adipose tissue were assessed. RAS improved the insulin sensitivity and reduced fat mass in WT mice but not in AMPK\u03b11",

    "abstract": "Promoting white adipose tissue (WAT) to acquire brown-like characteristics is a promising approach for obesity treatment. Although raspberry ketone (RK) has been reported to possess antiobesity activity, its effects on the formation of brown-like adipocytes remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of RK on WAT browning in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and rats with ovariectomy (Ovx)-induced obesity. RK (100 \u03bcM) significantly induced browning of 3T3-L1 cells by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and the expression of browning-specific proteins (PR domain containing 16, PRDM16; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, PGC-1\u03b1; uncoupling protein-1, UCP-1) and lipolytic enzymes (hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase). RK significantly reduced the expression of the autophagy-related protein Atg12 and increased the expression of p62 and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). Additionally, these effects of RK were reversed by the HO-1 inhibitor SnPP (20 \u03bcM). In addition, RK (160 mg/kg, gavage, for 8 weeks) significantly reduced body weight gain (Ovx+RK, 191.8 \u00b1 4.6 g vs. Ovx, 223.6 \u00b1 5.9; P < .05), food intake, the amount of inguinal adipose tissue (Ovx+RK, 9.05 \u00b1 1.1 g vs Ovx, 12.9 \u00b1 0.92 g; P < .05) and the size of white adipocytes in Ovx rats. Moreover, compared to expression in the Ovx group, the levels of browning-specific proteins were significantly higher and the levels of autophagy-related proteins were significantly lower in the Ovx+RK group. Therefore, this study elucidated the mechanism associated with RK-induced WAT browning and thus provides evidence to support the clinical use of RK for obesity treatment.",

    "abstract": "The development of a touchscreen platform for rodent testing has allowed new methods for cognitive testing that have been back-translated from clinical assessment tools to preclinical animal models. This platform for cognitive assessment in animals is comparable to human neuropsychological tests such as those employed by the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, and thus has several advantages compared to the standard maze apparatuses typically employed in rodent behavioral testing, such as the Morris water maze. These include improved translation of preclinical models, as well as high throughput and the automation of animal testing. However, these systems are relatively expensive, which can impede progress for researchers with limited resources. Here we describe a low-cost touchscreen operant chamber based on the single-board computer, Raspberry Pi",

    "abstract": "Glycation is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), where it potentiates the aggregation and toxicity of proteins such as \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2). Published studies support the anti-glycation and neuroprotective effects of several polyphenol-rich fruits, including berries, which are rich in anthocyanins. Herein, blackberry, black raspberry, blueberry, cranberry, red raspberry, and strawberry extracts were evaluated for: (1) total phenolic and anthocyanins contents, (2) free radical (DPPH) scavenging and reactive carbonyl species (methylglyoxal; MGO) trapping, (3) anti-glycation (using BSA-fructose and BSA-MGO models), (4) anti-A\u03b2 aggregation (using thermal- and MGO-induced fibrillation models), and, (5) murine microglia (BV-2) neuroprotective properties. Berry crude extracts (CE) were fractionated to yield anthocyanins-free (ACF) and anthocyanins-enriched (ACE) extracts. The berry ACEs (at 100 \u03bcg/mL) showed superior free radical scavenging, reactive carbonyl species trapping, and anti-glycation effects compared to their respective ACFs. The berry ACEs (at 100 \u03bcg/mL) inhibited both thermal- and MGO-induced A\u03b2 fibrillation. In addition, the berry ACEs (at 20 \u03bcg/mL) reduced H\u2082O\u2082-induced reactive oxygen species production, and lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide species in BV-2 microglia as well as decreased H\u2082O\u2082-induced cytotoxicity and caspase-3/7 activity in BV-2 microglia. The free radical scavenging, reactive carbonyl trapping, anti-glycation, anti-A\u03b2 fibrillation, and microglial neuroprotective effects of these berry extracts warrant further in vivo studies to evaluate their potential neuroprotective effects against AD.",

    "abstract": "In this work, an innovative cathodoluminescence (CL) system is coupled to a scanning electron microscope and synchronized with a Raspberry Pi computer integrated with an innovative processing signal. The post-processing signal is based on a Python algorithm that correlates the CL and secondary electron (SE) images with a precise dwell time correction. For CL imaging, the emission signal is collected through an optical fiber and transduced to an electrical signal via a photomultiplier tube (PMT). CL Images are registered in a panchromatic mode and can be filtered using a monochromator connected between the optical fiber and the PMT to produce monochromatic CL images. The designed system has been employed to study ZnO samples prepared by electrical arc discharge and microwave methods. CL images are compared with SE images and chemical elemental mapping images to correlate the emission regions of the sample.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose a simple shake-flask method to produce micron-size colloidosomes from a liquid-liquid interface functionalized with a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) film. A step-by-step extraction process of an organic phase partially miscible with water led to the formation of raspberry-like structures covered and protected by a gold nanofilm. The distinctive feature of the prepared colloidosomes is a very thin shell consisting of small AuNPs of 12 or 38 nm in diameter instead of several hundred nanometers reported previously. The interesting and remarkable property of the proposed approach is their reversibility: the colloidosomes may be easily transformed back to a nanofilm state simply by adding pure organic solvent. The obtained colloidosomes have a broadband absorbance spectrum, which makes them of great interest in applications such as photothermal therapy, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy studies, and microreactor vesicles for interfacial electrocatalysis.",

    "abstract": "Freeze-dried black raspberry (BRB) powder is considered as a potential cancer chemopreventive agent. In this study, we fed azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice with a diet containing BRB anthocyanins for 12 weeks, and this led to a reduction in colon carcinogenesis. These animals had consistently lower tumor multiplicity compared with AOM/DSS-treated mice not receiving BRB anthocyanins. In AOM/DSS-treated mice, the number of pathogenic bacteria, including Desulfovibrio sp. and Enterococcus spp., was increased significantly, whereas probiotics such as Eubacterium rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Lactobacillus were dramatically decreased, but BRB anthocyanins supplement could reverse this imbalance in gut microbiota. BRB anthocyanins also caused the demethylation of the SFRP2 gene promoter, resulting in increased expression of SFRP2, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, the expression levels of DNMT31 and DNMT3B, as well as of p-STAT3 were downregulated by BRB anthocyanins in these animals. Taken together, these results suggested that BRB anthocyanins could modulate the composition of gut commensal microbiota, and changes in inflammation and the methylation status of the SFRP2 gene may play a central role in the chemoprevention of CRC.",

    "abstract": "A sol-gel transformation of liquid silica precursor to solid silica particles was carried out in a one-pot synthesis way, where a solution of styrene butadiene elastomer was present. The composites, thus produced, offered remarkable improvements of mechanical and dynamic mechanical performances compared to precipitated silica. The morphological analysis reveals that the alkoxy-based silica particles resemble a raspberry structure when the synthesis of the silica was carried out in the presence of polymer molecules and represent a much more open silica-network structure. However, in the absence of the polymer, the morphology of the silica particles is found to be different. It is envisaged that the special morphology of the in situ synthesized silica particles contributes to the superior reinforcement effects, which are associated with a strong silica-rubber interaction by rubber chains trapped inside the raspberry-like silica aggregates. Therefore, the interfaces are characterized in detail by low-field solid-state ",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) contains a variety of polyphenols including anthocyanins and ellagitannins. Red raspberry polyphenols absorbed in different forms (parent compounds, degradants or microbial metabolites) are subject to xenobiotic metabolism in the intestine, liver, and/or kidney, forming methylate, glucuronide, and sulfate conjugated metabolites. Upon acute exposure, (poly)phenol/metabolite presence in the blood depends mainly on intestinal absorption, enterohepatic circulation, and metabolism by resident microbiota. However, chronic exposure to red raspberry polyphenols may alter metabolite patterns depending on adaptions in the xenobiotic machinery and/or microbiota composition. Understanding the metabolic fate of these compounds and their composition in different biological specimens relative to the exposure time/dose will aid in designing future health benefit studies, including the mechanism of action studies. The present exploratory study applied ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) and triple quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometries to characterize red raspberry polyphenols in fruit and then their appearance, including metabolites in human biological samples (plasma, urine and breast milk) after the chronic intake of red raspberries. The results suggested that the most abundant polyphenols in red raspberries included cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, sanguiin H6 and lambertianin C. Sixty-two (poly)phenolic compounds were tentatively identified in the plasma, urine and breast milk samples after the intake of red raspberries. In general, urine contained the highest content of phenolic metabolites; phase II metabolites, particularly sulfated conjugates, were mainly present in urine and breast milk, and breast milk contained fewer parent anthocyanins compared to urine and plasma.",

    "abstract": "Excessive lipid accumulation in white adipose tissue (WAT) leads to chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Raspberry (RB) contains high amount of polyphenols and dietary fibers. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of RB supplementation on WAT morphology, inflammation, and insulin signaling in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, and further explore the underlying mechanisms.\nC57BL/6J mice are fed with a control diet or a HFD supplemented with 0 or 5% freeze dried RB for 12 weeks. RB supplementation decreases WAT hypertrophy induced by HFD and suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and macrophage infiltration in WAT. Meanwhile, RB addition improves insulin sensitivity of HFD-mice. Additionally, RB supplementation drives the browning of WAT (beige adipogenesis), which is associated with elevated PGC-1\u03b1 and FNDC5/irisin contents. Consistently, the content of beige adipocyte markers including UCP1, PRDM16, Cytochrome C, Cidea, and Elvol3 is enhanced in HFD-mice, which are correlated with increased AMPK phosphorylation and Sirt1 protein contents.\nDietary RB attenuated adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation of WAT in HFD-mice and improves insulin sensitivity and beige adipogenesis, which is associated with increased FNDC5/irisin content and activation of AMPK/Sirt1 pathway. RB supplementation provides a promising strategy to prevent diet-induced obesity.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents surveys on residue levels of fungicides and insecticides applied according to the raspberry protection program. The field trials were conducted in 2013-2014 on a plantation of raspberry of the Laszka variety dessert raspberry very popular in Poland. Laboratory samples were collected starting from a day of the first fruit picking to the end of harvest. The highest mean residue levels were found for boscalid and pyraclostrobin (2.395\u00a0mg/kg and 0.732\u00a0mg/kg, respectively), in both cases they were at a level of about 24% of their maximum residue levels (MRLs); and for cypermethrin (0.235\u00a0mg/kg; i.e. close to 50% of its MRL). The long-term dietary intakes of those substances by Polish adult consumers were also at low levels of 0.52, 0.22, and 0.04% of acceptable daily intake (ADI), respectively. Therefore, the results obtained indicated that even on day zero of picking ripe raspberries, the pesticide residues not only were well below their corresponding MRLs, but also their daily intakes did not even approach 1% of the ADI. In 2013, pesticide residues in ripe fruit evolved according to a pattern different than in a subsequent year; while in 2014 they changed at a constant exponential rate.",

    "abstract": "Plant protection products (PPPs) have been found increasingly in the environment. They pose a huge threat to bees, contributing to honeybee colony losses and consequently to enormous economic losses. Therefore, this field investigation was designed to determine whether their active ingredients (AIs) were transferred from raspberry plants to beehives located in the immediate neighbourhood of the crop and to what extent they were transferred. Every week for 2\u00a0months, samples of soil, raspberry leaves, flowers and fruits, worker bees, honeybee brood, and honey were collected and analysed for the presence of propyzamide, chlorpyrifos, iprodione, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, cypermethrin, difenoconazole, azoxystrobin, and pyrimethanil residues. Five of these substances were found in the worker bee bodies. Chlorpyrifos, applied to only the soil through the irrigation system, also was detected in the brood. A small amount of boscalid was noted in the honey, but its residues did not exceed the maximum residue level. For chlorpyrifos, boscalid, and pyrimethanil, a positive correlation between the occurrence of PPPs in the crops and the beehives was found. Statistical methods confirmed that the application of PPPs on a raspberry plantation, as an example of nectar-secreting plants, was linked to the transfer of their AIs to beehives.",

    "abstract": "The cardioprotective role of raspberry ketone (RK) against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats was assessed.\nRats were randomly divided into Group I - Vehicle control; Group II - Toxic control ISO (85mg/kg, s.c.); Group III, IV and V - RK (50, 100 and 200mg/kg, respectively) with ISO; Group VI- RK (200mg/kg) alone; Group VII - Propranolol (10mg/kg) with ISO; and Group VIII - Propranolol (10mg/kg) alone. After twenty-four hours of the last dose, animals were sacrificed and creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density-lipoprotein, low-density-lipoprotein, very-low-density-lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, Na\nTreatment with ISO significantly deviated the biochemical parameters from the normal levels, which were considerably restored by RK at 100 and 200mg/kg doses. 50mg/kg dose, however, did not demonstrate any significant cardioprotective action. The histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis further substantiated these findings.\nOur study showed a dose-dependent reduction in oxidative stress, inflammation and dyslipidemia by RK in ISO-intoxicated rats, which signifies that RK from the European red raspberry plant might be a valuable entity for the management of MI.",

In our search for the health-promoting constituents from this fruit, four pairs of enantiomeric phenylpropanoids (1a/1b-4a/4b), including three new compounds (1a and 2a/2b), were isolated from red raspberry. Their structures were elucidated by a combination of the extensive NMR spectroscopic data analyses, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and comparison between the experimental measurements of electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and calculated ECD spectra by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT).

    "abstract": "Protein-polysaccharide interactions offer opportunities for designing the new functional foods with applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. In this work, we microencapsulated black raspberry water extracts by double emulsion technique prior to complex coacervation using gelatin and gum Arabic to diminish the instability of their anthocyanins (ANCs) as water soluble compounds, particularly under harsh processing and storage conditions. Subsequently, optical microscopy, moisture, hygroscopicity, solubility, particle size, loading capacity, zeta potential, color parameters (L*, a*, b*, C, H\u00b0 and TCD), stability, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermal behavior were evaluated. The microcapsules presented the lower moisture, hygroscopicity and solubility values as comparing the free form of ANCs. They showed the average sizes ranging from 35.34\u00b13.21 to 80.22\u00b15.21\u03bcm and high loading capacity (29.67\u00b10.66-38.54\u00b10.08%). According to the HPLC results, the selected method significantly increased the stability of ANCs up to 23.66% after 2 months of storage at 37\u00b12\u00b0C. FT-IR spectra confirmed the negative zeta potential values of microcapsules and the occurrence of coacervation process. DSC results evidenced the thermostability of microcapsules. Furthermore, the selected optimal microcapsules revealed intense red color over the time of storage, implying the effectiveness of the method chosen to preserve anthocyanins.",

    "abstract": "Botrytis fruit rot (BFR), one of the most important diseases of raspberry (Rubus spp.), is controlled primarily with fungicides. Despite the use of fungicides, crop losses due to BFR are high in most years. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between airborne inoculum, weather variables, and BFR in order to improve the management of the disease as well as harvest and storage decisions. Crop losses, measured as the percentage of diseased berries during the harvest period, were monitored in unsprayed field plots at four sites in three successive years, together with meteorological data and the number of conidia in the air. Based on windowpane analysis, there was no evidence of correlation between crop losses and temperature, vapor pressure deficit, wind, solar radiation, or probability of infection. There were significant correlations between crop losses and airborne inoculum and between crop losses and humidity-related variables, and the best window length was identified as 7 days. Using 7-day average airborne inoculum concentration combined with 7-day average relative humidity for periods ending 6 to 8 days before bloom, it was possible to accurately predict crop losses (R",

    "abstract": "Drosophila suzukii Matsumura is a serious pest of small fruits that lays its eggs in growing fruit. Current management strategies rely on an unsustainable schedule of foliar applications of chemical insecticides. Alternative approaches to suppressing oviposition are under investigation, such as attract-and-kill and the use of oviposition deterrents. Here, we evaluated two behavioral control approaches in combination as a push-pull strategy using laboratory and field assays.\nIn laboratory caged assays, both an attractive mass trapping device (pull) and an oviposition deterrent (push: 1-octen-3-ol) reduced oviposition by D. suzukii, and the combination of the two (push-pull) resulted in significantly greater reduction than either treatment alone. In field experiments, oviposition reduction was observed in fruit from plots treated with oviposition deterrent (push) or a combination of mass trapping devices and deterrent (push-pull) compared with fruit from control plots. However, oviposition in plots with mass trapping devices (pull) was higher than observed in all other treatments. Additionally, the protection provided by the deterrent in push plots extended to the entire plot rather than just in fruit closest to deterrent dispensers.\nPush-pull treatments negatively affected D. suzukii infestation in both laboratory and field experiments. The reduction in oviposition observed in laboratory experiments was based on the additive effect of push and pull components acting on a finite population, while the reduction observed in field experiments appeared to be mainly based on the effect of pull components. We discuss potential underlying reasons for the discrepancy results and suggest potential improvements. \u00a9 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",
