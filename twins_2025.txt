    "abstract": "Healthcare is one of the domains in which artificial intelligence (AI) is already having a major impact. Of interest is the idea of the digital twin (DT), an AI-powered technology that generates a real-time representation of the patient's body, offering the possibility of more personalised care. Our main thesis in this paper is that the DT does not merely represent the patient's body but produces a specific body. We argue, from a philosophical perspective and an ethical-phenomenological approach, that the virtual body created by the DT has a major impact on one's self-understanding, having consequences for gender expression and identification, and for health. This has deep implications for people who do not conform to gender normativity, for example, trans individuals. We advocate that, with thoughtful development, DT technology can and should be empowering, contributing to better addressing the diversity of bodies and facilitating trans people's experience in healthcare contexts.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence links per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and metabolic disruptions to fetal growth retardation. However, earlier studies on singletons couldn't fully account for genetic factors. Therefore, we used a co-twin control study design to identify cord metabolomic signatures of PFAS exposure and assess its mediating role in twin birthweight discordance. We analyzed 204 twin neonates born from the Wuhan Twin Birth Cohort (August 2016-January 2018). Cord serum PFAS concentrations and untargeted metabolomic profiles were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Within-twin metabolome-wide association analyses identified 69 metabolites (effect coefficients: 0.09-0.35) positively associated with log2-transformed perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) difference and 51 metabolites (effect coefficients: 0.08-0.38) positively associated with log2-transformed perfluoroheptane sulfonate (PFHpS) difference after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. PFAS-associated metabolites were primarily enriched in steroid hormone biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathways. Five amino acids, one carbohydrate, one cofactor and vitamin, and five lipids mediated the relationship between PFHpS exposure difference and intra-twin birthweight difference, with mediation proportions ranging from 32.0% to 72.7%. This study is the first to use a within-twin comparison, providing new insights into the underlying mechanisms linking PFAS exposure with twin birthweight discordance.",

    "abstract": "Identify microbial and microbiota-associated metabolites in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins discordant for type 1 diabetes (T1D) to gain insight into potential environmental factors that may influence T1D.\nSerum samples from 39 twins discordant for T1D were analyzed using a semi-targeted metabolomics approach via liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). Statistical analyses identified significant metabolites (p < 0.1) within three groups: All twins (combined group), MZ twins, and DZ twins.\nThirteen metabolites were identified as significant. 3-indoxyl sulfate and 5-hydroxyindole were significantly reduced in T1D individuals across all groups. Carnitine was reduced, and threonine, muramic acid, and 2-oxobutyric acid were significantly elevated in both All and MZ groups. Allantoin was significantly reduced and 3-methylhistidine was significantly elevated in All and DZ groups.\nMetabolite dysregulation associated with gut dysbiosis was observed. However, further validation of our findings in a larger cohort is needed.\nWhy did we undertake this study? We believed this cohort of twins discordant for type 1 diabetes (T1D) would allow for control over genetic variability to examine environmental factors.What is the specific question(s) we wanted to answer? We aimed to identify differences in microbial and microbiota-associated metabolites in twins discordant for T1D to examine the effect of the gut microbiome on T1D.What did we find? Thirteen metabolites were identified as significantly different.What are the implications of our findings? Our results show the dysregulation of several microbial metabolites in twin pairs, suggesting that the gut microbiome plays a role in the pathogenesis of T1D.",

    "abstract": "The Italian 12th-century copper alloy doors of Barisanus have long been the subject of art historical studies and have recently been fully documented photogrammetrically and archaeometrically. In addition, digital twins of the three Barisanus doors in Ravello, Trani and Monreale have been produced and made available in open access for further research. These digital twins, together with the orthophotos produced, allow precise and repeatable measurements of the different metal parts of the doors, such as panels and frieze elements. This, and by taking into account the solid shrinkage of metals during the casting process, allowed for the reconstruction of the production sequence for each of the 20 single motif panels present on all three doors, and, finally, also for the establishment of the production sequence of the three doors as a whole-heavily discussed in art history research-with rather astonishing results. Moreover, bronze casting techniques used and the use of moulds and models are discussed, painting a more detailed picture that goes beyond the often purported dichotomy of lost wax vs. sand casting.",

    "abstract": "Artificial phantoms play an important role in the development of body-area radio-communication devices and networks. This work aims to design, fabricate and validate physical anthropomorphic phantoms (PAP) of torso with their complementary digital twin models (DTM) emulating the anatomical and dielectric properties of the human body. Two PAPs-an obese lower abdomen and an athletic upper thorax- were designed and fabricated, with their DTMs. These PAPs cover both the ends of adult human body type spectrum. The heterogeneous phantoms consist of layers representing: skin, fat, muscle, rib cage, spinal column, and internal organ, fabricated using semi-solid, low water content materials. The phantoms were validated by comparing their dielectric properties with the IFAC database. The PAPs and DTMs were analyzed for the performance and safety of implantable/on-body radio-communication devices by measuring the values of reflection coefficient (S11) and simulating specific absorption rate (SAR). The results obtained are: (1) strong agreement of tissue layers' dielectric properties with the IFAC database over 0.5-10 GHz frequency range; (2) dielectric, physical, and mechanical stability for at least 16 months after fabrication; (3) (re)usability and implantability of the developed PAPs for communication studies on the performance and safety of implantable/on-body devices; (4) reliability of developed DTMs for SAR analysis of implantable and on-body devices.",

    "abstract": "Early treatment in spinal muscular atrophy is widely recognized as critical for improving neurologic and respiratory outcomes, especially in presymptomatic infants. With the expansion of newborn screening, more infants are now diagnosed presymptomatically. Currently, there are no established treatment guidelines for preterm infants with spinal muscular atrophy, with only anecdotal reports available. Additionally, there is limited knowledge regarding the safety and efficacy of the different treatments in preterm infants. In Israel, although a newborn screening program for spinal muscular atrophy is not yet implemented, a significant portion of the population participates in genetic carrier screening. Here, we present a case of presymptomatic preterm twins, born at gestational age of 32\u2009+\u20092 weeks, birth weights of 1855 and 1740 g, respectively. They were treated with risdiplam followed by onasemnogene abeparvovec at a gestational age of 35 and 43 weeks, respectively. This case adds to the limited data on treatment options for preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Studies on cardiovascular changes after fetal growth restriction (FGR) are limited by their design in which growth-restricted neonates are compared to appropriately-grown neonates. We aim to investigate early structural cardiovascular remodeling after FGR in identical twins, controlling for confounding of genetic and maternal factors.\nThis study is part of a prospective cohort study including monochorionic twins from January 2019. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed within one week after birth. Z-scores for cardiac valve annuli diameters and left ventricle dimensions based on gestational age at birth were compared between smaller and larger twins. Z-score differences between birth weight and cardiac structure per twin were tested against the intercept.\nMedian gestational age at birth of the 100 included twin pairs was 33.8 (interquartile range (IQR) 30.8-36.1) weeks, with birth weights of 1729 (IQR 1200-2115) grams for smaller twins and 2058 (IQR 1643-2500) grams for larger twins. Smaller twins had a lower z-score for all structures. Z-score differences in birth weight and cardiac structure were higher than the intercept.\nWhile cardiac structures are generally smaller for the twin with the lower birth weight, the deviation in birth weight tends to be more pronounced than the deviation in cardiac structure.\nOur study shows that in identical twins, the smaller twin at birth has a structurally smaller heart on neonatal echocardiography when compared to the larger twin. Yet, cardiac structures per individual twin are less affected than body size for their given gestational age at birth. We have used a unique natural experiment by studying a population of identical twins with varying degrees of birth weight discordance, eliminating any confounding of genetic, maternal and obstetrical factors. Our results are suggestive of early cardiovascular remodeling after adverse intrauterine circumstances. This provides insight into the fetal programming of cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Only a few studies have investigated the genetic background of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) requiring surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the concordance rates for LSS with DS requiring surgery by studying monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs.\nPatients between 18 and 85\u00a0years of age who underwent surgery for LSS with DS between 1996 and 2022 were identified in the national Swedish spine registry (14,614 patients) and matched with the Swedish Twin Registry to identify MZ and DZ twins. The concordance rates, the MZ/DZ concordance ratios, and the limits of genetic determination were calculated.\nWe identified 145 twin pairs (27 MZ and 118 DZ pairs) of whom 1 or both twins underwent surgery for LSS with DS. We found no concordant MZ pair and 2 concordant DZ pairs. When we evaluated pairs where at least one twin was operated for LSS with DS we found 2 concordant MZ pairs and 4 concordant DZ pairs (the co-twins were operated for LSS without DS) resulting in the probandwise concordance rate 0.14 (95% CI, 0 to 0.31) for MZ twins and 0.07 (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.13) for DZ twins. The probandwise MZ/DZ concordance ratio was 2.1 (95% CI 0-11.9). The limits of genetic determination were 0.27 to 0.36.\nOur findings suggest that heredity may not be of major etiologic importance in most cases of LSS with DS requiring surgery.",

    "abstract": "To investigate odds of vaginal delivery comparing induced versus spontaneous labor in nulliparas and multiparas with dichorionic twins.\nRetrospective review of dichorionic twin pregnancies from 2008-2021. Those with scheduled or elective cesarean, malpresentation, prior uterine surgery, fetal anomaly, gestational age (GA) at delivery < 34 weeks, and multifetal reduction were excluded. Nulliparas and multiparas were analyzed separately. The primary outcome was vaginal delivery of both twins. Secondary outcomes included preterm delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). Outcomes were compared among induced versus spontaneous labor and assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression.\nAmong 258 nulliparas, 176 (68.2%) were induced and 82 (31.8%) spontaneously labored. Induced patients were older (p=0.048), had higher proportion of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (IHCP) (p=0.04), HDP (p<0.0001) and later GA at delivery (p<0.0001). Patients who spontaneously labored had higher proportion of preterm delivery <37 (p<0.0001) and higher proportion of at least one twin admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (p=0.01). On univariable analysis, induction was associated with decreased likelihood of vaginal delivery of both twins (p=0.01). However, after adjusting for augmentation, GA at delivery, gestational diabetes, and HDP/chronic hypertension, this was no longer statistically significant (p=0.14). Among 239 multiparas, 108 (45.2%) were induced and 131 (54.8%) spontaneously labored. Induced patients had higher proportion IHCP (p=0.02), chronic hypertension (p=0.02), HDP (p<0.0001), and later GA at delivery (p<0.0001). Spontaneous labor patients had higher proportion of preterm delivery <37 (p<0.0001). There was no significant difference in odds of vaginal delivery between spontaneous versus induced labor on univariate (p=0.74) or adjusted analysis after controlling for augmentation, GA at delivery, gestational diabetes and HDP/chronic hypertension (p=0.40) among multiparas.\nAmong nulliparas and multiparas with dichorionic twins, induction of labor does not appear to be associated with decreased odds of vaginal delivery.",

On univariable analysis, induction was associated with decreased likelihood of vaginal delivery of both twins (p=0.01). However, after adjusting for augmentation, GA at delivery, gestational diabetes, and HDP/chronic hypertension, this was no longer statistically significant (p=0.14). Among 239 multiparas, 108 (45.2%) were induced and 131 (54.8%) spontaneously labored. Induced patients had higher proportion IHCP (p=0.02), chronic hypertension (p=0.02), HDP (p<0.0001), and later GA at delivery (p<0.0001). Spontaneous labor patients had higher proportion of preterm delivery <37 (p<0.0001). There was no significant difference in odds of vaginal delivery between spontaneous versus induced labor on univariate (p=0.74) or adjusted analysis after controlling for augmentation, GA at delivery, gestational diabetes and HDP/chronic hypertension (p=0.40) among multiparas.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare microscopic placental characteristics between preterm twins and singletons, and between preterm monochorionic and dichorionic twins, in order to explore the effect of placental pathology on adverse neonatal outcomes.\nThis study included 566 neonates born \u226432 weeks and/or \u22641500\u00a0g, of whom 429 were singletons and 137 were twins (38 monochorionic and 99 dichorionic). Clinical data was retrospectively collected, and placentas were prospectively examined for maternal vascular malperfusion, fetal vascular malperfusion and placental inflammation (acute and chronic).\nSingletons had increased rates of maternal vascular malperfusion, fetal hypoxia, funisitis (in umbilical cord and chorial plate), chronic deciduitis, and villitis of unknown etiology compared to twins. Delayed villous maturation and ischemia were more frequently present in monochorionic placentas than in dichorionic. Singletons had a significant lower birthweight and were more often small for gestational age than twins. Multivariate linear regression analysis adjusting for singleton pregnancy, gestational hypertension and placental abnormalities showed that gestational hypertension (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-114.8), infarct (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-130.1), decidual necrosis (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-115.4), fetal hypoxia (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-59.3) and chronic deciduitis (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-118.8) were independently associated with lower birthweight. Multivariate regression analysis revealed five independent risk factors of small for gestational age: gestational hypertension (OR 4.4), infarct (OR 3.7), decidual necrosis (OR 2.7), fetal hypoxia (OR 1.9) and villitis (OR 5.2).\nSingleton pregnancies vary in histological placental abnormality rates from twin pregnancies. This study demonstrated that differences in birthweight and small for gestational age rates between preterm twins and singletons can be attributed to gestational hypertension and histological placental abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins (MZTs) share nearly identical genomic DNA sequences, making traditional forensic short tandem repeats (STR) genotyping methods ineffective for distinguishing between them. In recent years, the use of epigenetic factors in forensic applications has gained traction. The dynamic epigenetic factors can be influenced by inherited traits or acquired environmental factors. This study analyzed the expression profiles of transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) in peripheral blood from four pairs of adult MZTs using Panoramic RNA Display by Overcoming RNA Modification Aborted Sequencing (PANDORA-seq). Differentially expressed tsRNAs (DEtsRNAs) were identified and validated using the reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in both adult and newborn MZTs. The study also evaluated the longitudinal temporal stability, resistance to degradation, and suitability of DEtsRNAs for aged bloodstains. A total of 8795 expressed tsRNAs were identified in the four pairs of adult MZTs by PANDORA-seq. After screening with a normalized | log",

With the increasing complexity of omics data, particularly multiomics, there is a growing need for advanced computational frameworks to interpret these data effectively.

This review discusses the integration of FMs into MDT systems, particularly their role in enhancing the interpretability of multiomics data. We examine current challenges, recent advancements, and future opportunities in leveraging FMs for multiomics analysis in MDTs, with a focus on their application in precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular digital twins and mechanistic models can be used to obtain new biomarkers from patient-specific hemodynamic data. However, such model-derived biomarkers are only clinically relevant if the uncertainty of the biomarkers is smaller than the variation between timepoints/patients. Unfortunately, this uncertainty is challenging to calculate, as the uncertainty of the underlying hemodynamic data is largely unknown and has several sources that are not additive or normally distributed. This violates normality assumptions of current methods; implying that also biomarkers have an unknown uncertainty. To remedy these problems, we herein present a method, with attached code, for uncertainty calculation of model-derived biomarkers using non-normal data. First, we estimated all sources of uncertainty, both normal and non-normal, in hemodynamic data used to personalize an existing model; the errors in 4D flow MRI-derived stroke volumes were 5-20\u00a0% and the blood pressure errors were 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0mmHg. Second, we estimated the resulting model-derived biomarker uncertainty for 100 simulated datasets, sampled from the data distributions, by: 1) combining data uncertainties 2) parameter estimation, 3) profile-likelihood. The true biomarker values were found within a 95\u00a0% confidence interval in 98\u00a0% (median) of the cases. This shows both that our estimated data uncertainty is reasonable, and that we can use profile-likelihood despite the non-normality. Finally, we demonstrated that e.g. ventricular relaxation rate has a smaller uncertainty (\u223c10\u00a0%) than the variation across a clinical cohort (\u223c40\u00a0%), meaning that these biomarkers have clinical potential. Our results take us one step closer to the usage of model-derived biomarkers for cardiovascular patient characterization.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins have long been of interest to the medical community. Evaluation is complex and tailored to the unique variant. A thorough multidisciplinary work-up, including surgical specialties, nursing, anesthesia, and critical care, must be performed prior to proceeding with surgical separation. Outcomes have become more predictable with certain advances such as tissue expansion and three-dimensional modeling. A number of important lessons learned from previous cases can be used to improve future outcomes.",

    "abstract": "22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, posing a diagnostic challenge. When cardinal characteristics, such as conotruncal cardiac anomalies or immunodeficiency, are absent, genetic testing may be delayed, postponing interventions to minimise developmental delay. We present a case of monochorionic monoamniotic identical twins diagnosed with de novo 22q11.2DS around 3\u2009months of life, who lacked major characteristics of the disease. Both infants were admitted and discharged multiple times with consistent concerns for failure to thrive (FTT) and aspiration. Twin B was incidentally found to have asymptomatic hypocalcaemia and hypoparathyroidism, leading to a 22q11.2DS diagnosis. Twin A had no symptoms other than FTT and aspiration. This case encourages considering 22q11.2DS in the differential diagnosis for FTT, even when classic symptoms are absent or delayed in presentation. Early recognition allows for timely intervention and better outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated whether having a familial risk of affective disorders, subclinical psychopathology, functioning, personality traits, stressful life events, and childhood trauma predict the onset or recurrence of affective episodes.\nThe present study is a 7-year follow-up study of a baseline sample of 204 monozygotic twins (MZ) with unipolar or bipolar disorder in remission or partial remission (affected), their unaffected co-twins (high-risk), and healthy twins with no personal or familial history of affective disorder (low-risk).\nDuring the 7.0-year median follow-up time, 59.3\u202f% of the affected twins had a recurrence of an affective episode, 33.3\u202f% of high-risk twins, and 7.5\u202f% of low-risk twins had an onset. Familial risk and being affected were predictors for onset and recurrence. Including the whole sample, subclinical symptoms, functioning, stressful life events, and the personality trait neuroticism were statistically significant predictors of onset and recurrence. Regarding the individual risk groups, increasing age was a significant predictor of increased hazard in the affected risk group and lower hazard in the low-risk group.\nThis follow-up study revealed that the most potent predictors for onset or recurrence were familial risk and having an affective disorder at baseline. Subclinical depressive symptoms, personality traits, stressful life events, and impaired functioning were significant contributors to onset risk and recurrence. These findings highlight the need to integrate relevant risk factors into daily clinical settings and integrate the most well-established factors as potential targets for primary care interventions.",

    "abstract": "Enterovirus is a well-known cause of infection in all age groups, with particular importance for neonates with both vertically and horizontally transmission. Neonatal clinical manifestations are highly variable and mostly is asymptomatic, but severe infections are described such as myocarditis, meningitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, coagulopathy, pneumonia and viral sepsis. Since 2022, The World Health Organization has recently reported an increasing number of severe neonatal infection associated with a new variant of Echovirus-11 (E-11). Many of the infants described with E-11 infections in a case reports series were preterm, male and twins. Despite the criticality of neonatal disease, the clinical management remains primarily supportive and therapeutic options are unfortunately few.\nWe present the case of male dichorionic diamniotic late-preterm twins, born in December 2023 at Filippo del Ponte Hospital in Varese (Northen Italy) with early Echovirus-11 infection. They had two dramatically different clinical scenarios and one of them developed a severe and fatal hemorrhage-hepatitis syndrome.\nOur experience has the purpose to emphasize public health attention to Echovirus-11 neonatal infections and their rare dramatically neonatal clinical presentations. Prematurity, host genetic predisposition and vertical transmission seem to be strong risk factors for severe infections, but it still need to be elucidated. According to previous Italian report, a surveillance protocols in all cases with unexpected clinical presentations and sequencing complete genome in order to better understand typing and molecular characterization of emerging and re-emerging pathogenic variants and new strains are strongly recommend in Italy.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy among women. Among 5%-10% of diagnoses are correlated with hereditary cancer syndromes, while the remaining cases are sporadic and linked to multiple factors. When a pathogenetic variant in one of the genes commonly associated with BC is detected, the patient is referred to a tailored surveillance program; otherwise, the standard follow-up guidelines are applied. We present a unique case of BC diagnosed in two monozygotic twins at the same age apparently unrelated to a hereditary syndrome known to date. Notably, despite comparable clinical-pathological features, the two neoplasms behaved differently to neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy, showing different outcomes and toxicities. Very little is known about the predictive mechanisms of response and toxicity to immunotherapy and this clinical case might be a starting point for further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Understanding of twin growth in the United States (US) is based on outdated or predominantly non-Hispanic White samples, and the age at which twins catch up to singletons is unclear. In this study, we characterized normative weight trajectories of twins and singletons in a contemporary, diverse cohort.\nData were from the PROMISE study, an electronic health record-based cohort of pregnant people and their children in the US (2005-2021). The Jenss model was used to characterize weight trajectories from 0 to 24\u00a0months of age. Twins (\nMale and female twins had lower birth weight compared to singletons and experienced a high rate of weight gain throughout infancy. Among males, twins caught up in weight to the full singleton cohort and to GA-matched singletons at approximately 12 and 6\u00a0months, respectively. Among females, twins caught up to GA-matched singletons at approximately 15\u00a0months but did not fully overcome their birth weight disadvantage to the full singleton sample by 24\u00a0months.\nThese findings highlight that the use of singleton growth charts or preterm singleton growth charts among twins may be inappropriate and suggest the need for a twin-specific growth chart. Future research is needed to understand factors that drive differences in weight trajectories between twins and singletons and to guide twin-specific guidelines.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study compared the speech-language development of a pair of dizygotic twin girls during the first 2 years of life: one with typical development (Twin A) and one with atypical development (Twin B), who was later diagnosed with Rett syndrome (RTT). Audio snippets were extracted from home videos, with nearly equal representation from each child. The audio analysis focused on articulatory complexity, voice characteristics, and linguistic variability. Despite sharing the same social-communicative environment, the twins' speech-language development diverged. From the first to second year of life, articulatory complexity and variability increased in the typically developing Twin A. In contrast, Twin B produced a high number of vocalizations in the 7th month, including canonical sounds with substantial variability. However, her vocalization quantity, complexity, and variability subsequently decreased, resulting in only sporadically discernable canonical vocalizations during her second year. This developmental trajectory points to very early stagnation and regression in Twin B, occurring earlier than typically observed. While Twin B displayed a range of typical vocalization features, deviations in the density and distribution of inspiratory and high-pitched vocalizations during the first year further suggest early speech-language abnormalities in RTT, preceding frank developmental stagnation and regression. As the study relied on limited retrospective data, the findings should be interpreted with caution, and further investigation is needed. Nevertheless, this twin study provides a unique perspective that deepens our understanding of early speech-language developmental profiles in RTT, especially in light of the intertwinement of genetic, individual, and contextual factors.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is the most frequent health-related condition worldwide and is a primary risk factor for renal and cardiovascular diseases. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. To uncover these mechanisms, multi-omics studies have significant potential, but such studies are challenged by genetic and environmental confounding - an issue that can be effectively reduced by studying intra-pair differences in twins. Here, we coupled data on hypertension diagnoses from the nationwide Danish Patient Registry to a study population of 740 twins for whom genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression data were available together with measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We investigated five phenotypes: incident hypertension cases, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, hypertension (140/90\u2009mmHg), and hypertension (130/80\u2009mmHg). Statistical analyses were performed using Cox (incident cases) or linear (remaining) regression analyses at both the individual-level and twin pair-level. Significant genes (p\u2009<\u20090.05) at both levels and in both types of biological data were investigated by bioinformatic analyses, including gene set enrichment analysis and interaction network analysis. Overall, most of the identified pathways related to the immune system, particularly inflammation, and biology of vascular smooth muscle cell. Of specific genes, lysine methyltransferase 2\u2009A (KMT2A) was found to be central for incident hypertension, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) for systolic blood pressure, and beta-actin (ACTB) for diastolic blood pressure. Noteworthy, lysine methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A) was also identified in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure analyses. Here, we present novel biomarkers for hypertension. This study design is surprisingly rare in the field of hypertension. We identified biological pathways related to vascular smooth muscle cells and the immune system, particular inflammation, to be associated with hypertension and blood pressure. Of specific genes, we identified KMT2A (lysine methyltransferase 2A) to be central for blood pressure and hypertension development.

    "abstract": "Digital twins (DTs) are digital representations of real-world systems, enabling advanced simulations, predictive modeling, and real-time optimization in various fields, including health care. Despite growing interest, the integration of DTs in health care faces challenges such as fragmented applications, ethical concerns, and barriers to adoption.\nThis study systematically reviews the existing literature on DT applications in health care with three objectives: (1) to map primary applications, (2) to identify key challenges and limitations, and (3) to highlight gaps that can guide future research.\nA meta-review was conducted in a systematic fashion, adhering to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, and included 25 literature reviews published between 2021 and 2024. The search encompassed 5 databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Embase, and PsycINFO. Thematic synthesis was used to categorize DT applications, stakeholders, and barriers to adoption.\nA total of 3 primary DT applications in health care were identified: personalized medicine, operational efficiency, and medical research. While current applications, such as predictive diagnostics, patient-specific treatment simulations, and hospital resource optimization, remain in their early stages of development, they highlight the significant potential of DTs. Challenges include data quality, ethical issues, and socioeconomic barriers. This review also identified gaps in scalability, interoperability, and clinical validation.\nDTs hold transformative potential in health care, providing individualized care, operational optimization, and accelerated research. However, their adoption is hindered by technical, ethical, and financial barriers. Addressing these issues requires interdisciplinary collaboration, standardized protocols, and inclusive implementation strategies to ensure equitable access and meaningful impact.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a highly heterogeneous condition, and current methods struggle to synthesize extensive clinical data for personalized care. Using data from 343 HF patients, we developed mechanistic computational models of the cardiovascular system to create digital twins. These twins, consisting of optimized measurable and unmeasurable parameters alongside simulations of cardiovascular function, provided comprehensive representations of individual disease states. Unsupervised machine learning applied to digital twin-derived features identified interpretable phenogroups and mechanistic drivers of cardiovascular death risk. Incorporating these features into prognostic AI models improved performance, transferability, and interpretability compared to models using only clinical variables. This framework demonstrates potential to enhance prognosis and guide therapy, paving the way for more precise, individualized HF management.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex developmental disorder whose molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. The developmental course of schizophrenia can be modeled with human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) -derived brain cells that carry patient-specific genetic risk factors for the disorder. Although transcriptomic characterization of the patient-derived cells is a standard procedure, microRNA (miRNA) profiling is less frequently performed. To investigate the role of miRNAs in transcriptomic regulation in schizophrenia, we performed miRNA sequencing for hiPSC-derived neurons from five monozygotic twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia and six controls (CTR). We compared the miRNA expression to differentially expressed genes (DEGs) reported for the same cells in our earlier work. We found 21 DEmiRNAs between the affected twins (AT) and CTR with implications for the regulation of neuronal function. In addition, a separate analysis of three AT with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), their unaffected twins (UT), and CTR revealed an upregulation of four miRNAs in the UT compared to both AT and CTR. The DEmiRNAs found between the UT and CTR were associated with increased cAMP/PKA signaling and synaptogenesis signaling in the UT. We hypothesize that the upregulation of these processes in the UT could be linked to compensatory features against schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents significant challenges in drug discovery and development due to its complex and poorly understood pathology and etiology. Digital twins (DTs) are recently developed virtual real-time representations of physical entities that enable rapid assessment of the bidirectional interaction between the virtual and physical domains. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the growing accumulation of multi-omics and clinical data, application of DTs in healthcare is gaining traction. Digital twin technology, in the form of multiscale virtual models of patients or organ systems, can track health status in real time with continuous feedback, thereby driving model updates that enhance clinical decision-making. Here, we posit an additional role for DTs in drug discovery, with particular utility for complex diseases like AD. In this review, we discuss salient challenges in AD drug development, including complex disease pathology and comorbidities, difficulty in early diagnosis, and the current high failure rate of clinical trials. We also review DTs and discuss potential applications for predicting AD progression, discovering biomarkers, identifying new drug targets and opportunities for drug repurposing, facilitating clinical trials, and advancing precision medicine. Despite significant hurdles in this area, such as integration and standardization of dynamic medical data and issues of data security and privacy, DTs represent a promising approach for revolutionizing drug discovery in AD.",

    "abstract": "Genetic factors are considered important in the development of degenerative spine disease. The aim of this study was to determine the twin concordance rates for the common cervical spine diseases cervical disk herniation (CDH), cervical foraminal stenosis (CFS), and degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) requiring surgical treatment by studying monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs.\nPatients, aged 18-85 years, operated for CDH, CFS, or DCM between 1996 and 2022 were identified in the national Swedish spine register (5962 CDH, 3801 CFS, and 3131 DCM) and matched with the Swedish twin registry to identify MZ and DZ twins. Concordance rates were calculated.\nThere were 64 twin pairs where one or both twins had surgical treatment for CDH. The corresponding numbers for surgically treated CFS and DCM were 37 twin pairs and 44 twin pairs respectively. For twins with CDH we found one concordant MZ pair and no concordant DZ pair (MZ probandwise concordance rate 0.12 [95% CI 0-0.33]). For twins with CFS we found one concordant MZ pair and no concordant DZ pair (MZ probandwise concordance rate 0.14 [95% CI 0-0.38]). In DCM patients we found no concordant twin pair.\nIn this national observational study, including 145 twin pairs, the concordance rates were low for surgically treated CDH, CFS, and DCM conditions. Our findings suggest that not only genetic factors, but also environmental factors and personal preferences are important whether a patient goes to surgery for this type of condition.",

    "abstract": "The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report on December 15, 2023, \"Foundational Research Gaps and Future Directions for Digital Twins.\" This described the importance of using biomimetic digital twins and multiomics in research. We incorporated these in our analysis of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We performed exome sequencing, genotype-phenotype ranking, and biomimetic digital twin analysis. We identified five pathogenic and one likely pathogenic DNA variants in patient samples analyzed but absent from controls. The variants identified in these genes, P2RX7, HTRA2, PTPN22, FLG, CD46, and EIF4G1, play a role in the development of RA. We also identified 3172 variants of unknown clinical significance (VUSs) in patient samples, absent from controls. All VUSs appeared to be associated with RA. We identified hidden or dark data from six genes. The genes, often found in patient samples, included genes HIF1A, HLA-DOA, PTGER3, HIPK3, TGFBR3, and HIF1A-AS3. VUSs identified in genes HIF1A, HLA-DOA, PTGER3, and HIPK3 are directly related to the pathogenesis of RA, whereas VUSs identified in genes TGFBR3 and HIF1A-AS3 are indirectly related. Our results suggest that by using biomimetic digital twins and multiomics, we can gain more insight into the development of RA. We can also potentially begin the process of reclassifying VUSs. The reclassification of VUSs will play a critical role in complex molecular diagnostics and drug development.",

    "abstract": "Many post-authorization safety studies focus on congenital malformations and rely on diagnosis codes found in US data sources. However, no authoritative standards exist for identifying and classifying malformations in these data. To address this, we translated an existing public health surveillance guide, the European Concerted Action on Congenital Anomalies and Twins (EUROCAT), into an ICD-10-CM code list for use in studies using US administrative healthcare data. The EUROCAT guide was selected for its decisive major or minor classification of each code. However, translation was required for use in US data sources since EUROCAT utilizes ICD-10-BPA which differs from ICD-10-CM (the coding system commonly encountered in US data sources).\nWe mapped EUROCAT to ICD-10-CM. For each code, manual review was conducted by two or more researchers, and major/minor classification was based on code descriptions since some codes differed between coding systems.\nA final code list was created, containing 916 ICD-10-CM codes for 744 major and 172 minor malformations. The code list contains ICD-10-CM codes, their corresponding descriptions, their major or minor classification and disease category according to EUROCAT, and variables indicating anomalies caused by genetic or infectious diseases unlikely attributable to a medication.\nWe adapted the EUROCAT Guide 1.5 into an ICD-10-CM code list for use in pregnancy studies using US data sources. This list includes new ICD-10-CM codes available in 2024. As new ICD-10-CM codes become available, or as the EUROCAT Guide is updated, further updates to this list will be needed.",

    "abstract": "In preterm infants, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most devastating complications seen in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), with both short- and long-term sequelae. Outcomes reported for mono- (versus di-) chorionic twins suggest an increased incidence in the monochorionic twins, usually attributed to abnormal placental vascular connections. Same sex concordance and zygosity data suggest shared genetic and environmental factors as important contributing factors to the pathogenesis of NEC. This concept is further supported by fecal microbiome data from preterm twins. However, there is also some uncertainty in these observations because studies that controlled for gestational age did not show significant differences between singletons and twins in the occurrence of NEC. This mini-review was undertaken as a critical appraisal of the published literature in terms of twin studies to establish the genetic relevance vis-\u00e0vis NEC. There is a need for further evaluation of genetic and confounding factors arising from the environment and the gut microbiome in these infants using cohorts with larger sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "A key component in developing atrial digital twins (ADT) - virtual representations of patients' atria - is the accurate prescription of myocardial fibers which are essential for the tissue characterization. Due to the difficulty of reconstructing atrial fibers from medical imaging, a widely used strategy for fiber generation in ADT relies on mathematical models. Existing methodologies utilize semi-automatic approaches, are tailored to specific morphologies, and lack rigorous validation against imaging fiber data. In this study, we introduce a novel atrial Laplace-Dirichlet-Rule-Based Method (LDRBM) for prescribing highly detailed myofiber orientations and providing robust regional annotation in bi-atrial morphologies of any complexity. The robustness of our approach is verified in eight extremely detailed bi-atrial geometries, derived from a sub-millimeter Diffusion-Tensor-Magnetic-Resonance Imaging (DTMRI) human atrial fiber dataset. We validate the LDRBM by quantitatively recreating each of the DTMRI fiber architectures: a comprehensive comparison with DTMRI ground truth data is conducted, investigating differences between electrophysiology (EP) simulations provided by either LDRBM and DTMRI fibers. Finally, we demonstrate that the novel LDRBM outperforms current state-of-the-art (LDRBMs and Universal Atrial Coordinates) fiber models, confirming the exceptional accuracy of our methodology and the critical importance of incorporating detailed fiber orientations in EP simulations. Ultimately, this work represents a fundamental step towards the development of physics-based digital twins of the human atria, establishing a new standard for prescribing fibers in ADT.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the ethical controversies surrounding separation surgery of conjoined twins by examining the discussions in the relevant published literature. A critical review was conducted to study the ethical issues involved in the separation surgery of conjoined twins. A literature search on PubMed and Embase was performed on December 4, 2023, using the terms \"ethics\", \"conjoined twins\", and \"separation\". Relevant papers published in the last 10 years (2013-2023) were included. A total of seven papers were included: two were case reports and five were expert statements or opinions. The four pillars of ethics (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice) were a common approach adopted by most authors to analyse the ethical issues in the separation surgery of conjoined twins. Due to the need to consider the perspectives of two patients simultaneously, opposing arguments were common depending on the approach taken, especially when analysing the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence. All papers examined the possible difficulties in autonomy, with some exploring consent, specifically around decision-making. It was largely agreed that the parents should be the decision-makers due to the patients' lack of capacity, except in non-urgent situations, where patients should be given the opportunity to make their own decisions. Achieving equality in the distribution of shared organs and survival opportunities proved challenging. Other ethical principles were also discussed, such as the act-omission and double effect doctrines. Limitations of this paper included the limited geographical coverage of the studies, as well as the potential to miss relevant studies, including those conducted beyond the search period, those published in other languages, and those unpublished. From the overall results, there is no apparent definite answer as to whether separation surgery is justified. Due to every patient and situation being unique, the best approach should be decided on a case-by-case basis, guided by the four pillars of ethics, and with the involvement of families and ethical committees. Both the ethical considerations and other factors should be taken into account.",

    "abstract": "A conjoined parasitic twin is a grossly defective fetus or fetal parts attached externally to a relatively normal twin. Rachipagus conjoined twins are fused at the spine. Conjoined twinning is an exceedingly uncommon congenital abnormality, with rachipagus twinning being the rarest variant.\nThe authors report the case of a rare parasitic rachipagus conjoined twin who was surgically managed at 9 weeks of age. The patient presented with skin-covered swelling on her upper back that resembled digits. Further study with computed tomography showed parasitic content of the digits and embryonic tissue and the absence of posterior elements of the T4 and T5 vertebrae without meningocele at the autosite. The patient underwent successful excision of the parasitic twin and subsequently had normal growth and development.\nNeural tube defects of varying degrees occur in almost all rachipagus parasites, which should be taken into account in the comprehensive treatment of the pathology. Patients vary in the degree of fusion, and preoperative imaging to demonstrate the complex surgical anatomy at the fusion site should be an integral part of treatment. A multidisciplinary team consisting of neurosurgeons, pediatric surgeons, and plastic surgeons is required. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24698.",

Omic technologies, such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, provide comprehensive insights into molecular profile of an individual, revealing potential disease predispositions and health trajectories. IoT devices, such as wearables and smartphones, enable continuous and periodic monitoring of physiological parameters, thus providing a dynamic view of an individual's health status. AI algorithms analyze comprehensive and complex data from omics and IoT technologies to identify patterns and correlations that inform predictive models of disease risk, progression, and response to interventions. Medical digital twins, or virtual replicas of an individual's biological processes, have emerged as the cornerstone of preemptive medicine. The integration of omics, IoT, and AI enables the development of medical digital twins, which in turn allows for precise simulation of human physiological profiles, prediction of future health outcomes, and virtual individual clinical trials, facilitating personalized proactive interventions and preemptive disease control. This review demonstrates the convergence of omics, IoT, and AI in preemptive medicine, highlighting their potential to revolutionize healthcare by enabling early disease detection, personalized treatment strategies, and chronic disease prevention. We show how AI leverages omics and IoT in preemptive medicine through several case studies while also discussing the necessary data for developing medical digital twins and addressing ethical and social aspects that warrant consideration. Medical digital twins signify a fundamental transformation in health management, shifting from treating diseases after their occurrence to controlling them before their occurrence. This approach enhances the effectiveness of medical interventions and improves overall health outcomes, preparing for a healthier future.",

    "abstract": "To investigate changes in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in the amniotic fluid of recipient twins with twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), analyze the correlation between NT-proBNP and cardiac linear measurements, and assess the feasibility of NT-proBNP as a biochemical marker for fetal cardiac function.\nA total of 47 pregnancies with TTTS, 21 idiopathic polyhydramnios pregnancies, and 114 normal singleton pregnancies were included from Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between October 2020 and July 2023. Fetal cardiac linear parameters, amniotic fluid depth, and NT-proBNP levels in amniotic fluid were measured across the three groups. The correlation of NT-proBNP with amniotic fluid depth, cardiac linear parameters, and CHOP score in TTTS recipients was analyzed.\nThere was no statistically significant difference in amniotic fluid NT-proBNP levels and cardiac linear parameters between idiopathic polyhydramnios and normal singletons. However, NT-proBNP levels and cardiac parameters in TTTS recipient twins were significantly higher than in the other two groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). After adjusting for gestational variables, NT-proBNP levels in TTTS recipients showed significant correlations with atrial and ventricular diameters, ventricular wall thickness, cardiothoracic ratio, and CHOP score.\nAmniotic fluid NT-proBNP is a sensitive and objective biochemical marker for assessing fetal cardiac function, independent of amniotic fluid volume. It serves as a valuable complement to echocardiographic assessment in evaluating the severity of fetal heart failure in TTTS recipients.",

    "abstract": "Ineffective medication is a major healthcare problem causing significant patient suffering and economic costs. This issue stems from the complex nature of diseases, which involve altered interactions among thousands of genes across multiple cell types and organs. Disease progression can vary between patients and over time, influenced by genetic and environmental factors. To address this challenge, digital twins have emerged as a promising approach, which have led to international initiatives aiming at clinical implementations. Digital twins are virtual representations of health and disease processes that can integrate real-time data and simulations to predict, prevent, and personalize treatments. Early clinical applications of DTs have shown potential in areas like artificial organs, cancer, cardiology, and hospital workflow optimization. However, widespread implementation faces several challenges: (1) characterizing dynamic molecular changes across multiple biological scales; (2) developing computational methods to integrate data into DTs; (3) prioritizing disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets; (4) creating interoperable DT systems that can learn from each other; (5) designing user-friendly interfaces for patients and clinicians; (6) scaling DT technology globally for equitable healthcare access; (7) addressing ethical, regulatory, and financial considerations. Overcoming these hurdles could pave the way for more predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine, potentially transforming healthcare delivery and improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Genetically informative twin studies have consistently found that individual differences in anxiety and depression symptoms are stable and primarily attributable to time-invariant genetic influences, with non-shared environmental influences accounting for transient effects.\nWe explored the etiology of psychological and somatic distress in 2279 Australian twins assessed up to six times between ages 12-35. We evaluated autoregressive, latent growth, dual-change, common, and independent pathway models to identify which, if any, best describes the observed longitudinal covariance and accounts for genetic and environmental influences over time.\nAn autoregression model best explained both psychological and somatic distress. Familial aggregation was entirely explained by additive genetic influences, which were largely stable from ages 12 to 35. However, small but significant age-dependent genetic influences were observed at ages 20-27 and 32-35 for psychological distress and at ages 16-19 and 24-27 for somatic distress. In contrast, environmental influences were predominantly transient and age-specific.\nThe longitudinal trajectory of psychological distress from ages 12 to 35 can thus be largely explained by forward transmission of a stable additive genetic influence, alongside smaller age-specific genetic innovations. This study addresses the limitation of previous research by exhaustively exploring alternative theoretical explanations for the observed patterns in distress symptoms over time, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic and environmental factors influencing psychological and somatic distress across this age range.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions is critical for advancing drug discovery. By reducing time and cost, machine learning and deep learning can accelerate this laborious discovery process. In a novel approach, BarlowDTI, we utilise the powerful Barlow Twins architecture for feature-extraction while considering the structure of the target protein. Our method achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance against multiple established benchmarks using only one-dimensional input. The use of our hybrid approach of deep learning and gradient boosting machine as the underlying predictor ensures fast and efficient predictions without the need for substantial computational resources. We also propose the use of an influence method to investigate how the model reaches its decision based on individual training samples. By comparing co-crystal structures, we find that BarlowDTI\u00a0effectively exploits catalytically active and stabilising residues, highlighting the model's ability to generalise from one-dimensional input data. In addition, we further benchmark new baselines against existing methods. Together, these innovations improve the efficiency and effectiveness of drug-target interactions predictions, providing robust tools for accelerating drug development and deepening the understanding of molecular interactions. Therefore, we provide an easy-to-use web interface that can be freely accessed at https://www.bio.nat.tum.de/oc2/barlowdti . SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: Our computationally efficient and effective hybrid approach, combining the deep learning model Barlow Twins and gradient boosting machines, outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple splits and benchmarks using only one-dimensional input. Furthermore, we advance the field by proposing an influence method that elucidates model decision-making, thereby providing deeper insights into molecular interactions and improving the interpretability of drug-target interactions predictions.",

    "abstract": "Many species of fish, birds and mammals commonly live in human captivity; Atlantic salmon Salmo salar is one of them. The international legal status of the welfare of captive animals is slowly developing and still requires rigorous specification. For example, even though fish have complex cognition and elements of sentience, The United Nations' animal welfare principles still take a functional health-centred perspective overlooking the cognitive-affective component. Wellbeing problems remain a major source of slow growth and high mortality in intensive aquaculture of Atlantic salmon. The value system for decision making in vertebrates is based on expectations of emotional wellbeing for the options available and is linked with the individual's assessment of its future. We propose a new approach for monitoring and improving the welfare of salmon (or any other captive or wild vertebrate) based on modelling the salmon's wellbeing system by digital twins, which are simulation models that implement major bodily mechanisms of the organism. Indeed, predictions on boredom, stress and wellbeing can all be captured by a computational evolutionary model of the factors underlying behaviour. We explain how such an agent-based model of salmon digital twins can be constructed by modelling a salmon's subjective wellbeing experience along with prediction of its near future and allostasis (the bodily preparation for the expected near future). We attempt to identify the building blocks required in digital twin models to deliver early warnings about escalating issues that could eventually lead to negative effects on salmon health in aquaculture. These models would provide critical insights for optimizing production processes and could significantly reduce the reliance on animal experiments. Overall, reports of a population of digital twins could support the implementation of 3Rs - replacement, reduction, refinement - by offering actionable information to fish farmers as well as consumers, voters, politicians and regulators on relevant issues as well as guide experimental work on animal wellbeing across species.",

    "abstract": "While prepregnancy overweight or obesity is known to negatively impact maternal health, its effect on twin infants is not well understood. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide, multicenter retrospective study to investigate the association between maternal prepregnancy weight and health outcomes in twins.\nThis study collected data from 22 healthcare units across 12 regions in China between January 2018 and December 2020. To control for confounding factors, multiple logistic regression, propensity score matching (PSM), inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), and overlapping weighting models (OW) were applied to explore the effects of prepregnancy BMI on Apgar scores and other outcomes.\nAfter screening, a total of 4,724 women with twin pregnancies and 9,448 newborns were included in the study. Compared to normal prepregnancy weight, prepregnancy overweight/obesity significantly increased the risk of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes in mothers [adjusted OR (95% CI): 1.85 (1.55-2.21) and 1.49 (1.27-1.74), respectively]. It also increased the incidence of twins with a 1-min Apgar score \u22647, whether they were larger or smaller [1.60 (1.20-2.13) and 1.45 (1.09-1.92), respectively]. Sensitivity analyses using PSM [1.60 (1.20-2.13) and 1.55 (1.07-2.25)], IPTW [1.67 (1.31-2.12) and 1.48 (1.17-1.87)], and OW [1.65 (1.08-2.57) and 1.47 (0.97-2.25)] confirmed the stability of these results. However, it did not affect the likelihood of a 5-min Apgar score \u22647 [adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.82 (0.24-2.17) and 1.40 (0.70-2.73)]. In contrast, prepregnancy underweight was associated with a reduced incidence of twins with a 1-min Apgar score \u22647 [adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.56 (0.32-0.92) and 0.58 (0.34-0.94)], but had no effect on the 5-min Apgar score \u22647 [adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.82 (0.24-2.17) and 0.22 (0.01-1.08)]. Prepregnancy BMI did not significantly affect twin birth weight discordance, NICU admission, preterm birth, or low birth weight.\nMaternal overweight/obesity before pregnancy increases the risk of hypertensive disorders and gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies and significantly raises the likelihood of twins having a low 1-min Apgar score. However, no significant impact on 5-min Apgar scores was observed. These findings highlight the importance of managing weight before pregnancy and ensuring readiness for neonatal resuscitation during delivery.",

    "results": "After screening, a total of 4,724 women with twin pregnancies and 9,448 newborns were included in the study. Compared to normal prepregnancy weight, prepregnancy overweight/obesity significantly increased the risk of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes in mothers [adjusted OR (95% CI): 1.85 (1.55-2.21) and 1.49 (1.27-1.74), respectively]. It also increased the incidence of twins with a 1-min Apgar score \u22647, whether they were larger or smaller [1.60 (1.20-2.13) and 1.45 (1.09-1.92), respectively]. Sensitivity analyses using PSM [1.60 (1.20-2.13) and 1.55 (1.07-2.25)], IPTW [1.67 (1.31-2.12) and 1.48 (1.17-1.87)], and OW [1.65 (1.08-2.57) and 1.47 (0.97-2.25)] confirmed the stability of these results. However, it did not affect the likelihood of a 5-min Apgar score \u22647 [adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.82 (0.24-2.17) and 1.40 (0.70-2.73)]. In contrast, prepregnancy underweight was associated with a reduced incidence of twins with a 1-min Apgar score \u22647 [adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.56 (0.32-0.92) and 0.58 (0.34-0.94)], but had no effect on the 5-min Apgar score \u22647 [adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.82 (0.24-2.17) and 0.22 (0.01-1.08)]. Prepregnancy BMI did not significantly affect twin birth weight discordance, NICU admission, preterm birth, or low birth weight.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of perinatal studies is complicated by twins and other multiple births even when multiples are not the exposure, outcome, or a confounder of interest. In analyses of infant outcomes restricted to live births, common approaches to handling multiples include restriction to singletons, counting outcomes at the pregnancy level (i.e., by counting if at least one twin experienced a binary outcome), or infant-level analysis including all infants and accounting for clustering of outcomes, such as by using generalized estimating equations or mixed effects models. Several healthcare administration databases only support restriction to singletons or pregnancy-level approaches. For example, in MarketScan insurance claims data, diagnoses in twins are often assigned to a single infant identifier, thereby preventing ascertainment of infant-level outcomes among multiples. Different approaches correspond to different questions, produce different estimands, and often rely on different assumptions. We demonstrate the differences that can arise from these different approaches using Monte Carlo simulations, algebraic formulas, and an applied example.",

    "abstract": "The personal identification of monozygotic (MZ) twins is of great importance in forensic medicine. Due to the extreme similarity in genetic between MZ twins, it is challenging to differentiate them using autosomal STR genotyping. Forensic experts are striving to explore available genetic markers that can differentiate between MZ twins. With the advent of next-generation sequence (NGS), an increasing number of genetic markers have been demonstrated to effectively differentiate between MZ twins. Here, we summarized for the relevant studies on MZ twins' differentiation and discussed the limitations of the underlying markers. In details, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variation (CNV), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), DNA methylation, and non-coding RNA have been demonstrated considerable value. Furthermore, the utilization of proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics has shed light on MZ twin differentiation. Additionally, we introduce the methodologies for MZ differentiation based on external morphological variations observed in the human body. Looking to the future, the process of aging may represent a novel avenue for the differentiation of MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "It is challenging to distinguish monozygotic (MZ) twins using traditional autosomal STR genotyping due to their nearly identical genomes. As an important kind of small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) are essential regulators of gene expression and considered as excellent biomarkers due to their resistance to degradation. Moreover, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has emerged as a powerful technique for detecting gene mutations and pathogenic microorganisms, owing to its sensitivity and reliability. We aimed to explore the differential expression of miRNAs between MZ twins using next-sequence platform and assess the reliability of differentially expressed miRNAs by ddPCR. MiRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) revealed nine differentially expressed miRNAs shared across five pairs of twins, including hsa-miR-3620-3p, hsa-miR-6825-5p, hsa-miR-1273h-5p, hsa-miR-200a-5p, hsa-miR-3192-5p, hsa-miR-188-5p, hsa-miR-206, hsa-miR-4796-5p, and hsa-miR-6775-3p. Subsequently, the combination of real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and ddPCR confirmed the ability of five of these miRNAs (hsa-miR-1273h-5p, hsa-miR-3192-5p, hsa-miR-188-5p, hsa-miR-206, and hsa-miR-6775-3p) in distinguishing monozygotic twins. Furthermore, ddPCR demonstrated superior recognition accuracy compared to qPCR. Finally, we evaluated the degradation resistance of these five miRNAs under different environmental conditions. None of the five miRNAs showed a significant decrease in expression levels after being stored at room temperature for up to 180 days or undergoing 10 freeze-thaw cycles. In summary, our study revealed the potential application of miRNAs in differentiation of MZ twins and the powerful role of ddPCR in forensic medicine.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine involves a paradigm shift toward personalized data-driven clinical decisions. The concept of a medical \"digital twin\" has recently become popular to designate digital representations of patients as a support for a wide range of data science applications. However, the concept is ambiguous when it comes to practical implementations. Here, we propose a medical digital twin framework with a data-centric approach. We argue that a single digital representation of patients cannot support all the data uses of digital twins for technical and regulatory reasons. Instead, we propose a data architecture leveraging three main families of digital representations: (1) multimodal dashboards integrating various raw health records at points of care to assist with perception and documentation, (2) virtual patients, which provide nonsensitive data for collective secondary uses, and (3) individual predictions that support clinical decisions. For a given patient, multiple digital representations may be generated according to the different clinical pathways the patient goes through, each tailored to balance the trade-offs associated with the respective intended uses. Therefore, our proposed framework conceives the medical digital twin as a data architecture leveraging several digital representations of patients along clinical pathways.",

Herein, we report an unusual case of young monozygotic twins with early disease onset presenting different course of disease progression and clinical manifestations. Echocardiography with multiparameters was used for the diagnosis, screening, and follow-up of the disease for the family. Cardiac magnetic resonance revealed the fibrosis distribution in the right ventricular with late gadolinium enhancement. DSG2 mutation was found in the family members, which confirmed the final diagnosis of ARVC.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) offer personalized in-silico cardiac representations for the inference of multi-scale properties tied to cardiac mechanisms. The creation of CDTs requires precise information about the electrode position on the torso, especially for the personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) calibration. However, current studies commonly rely on additional acquisition of torso imaging and manual/semi-automatic methods for ECG electrode localization. In this study, we propose a novel and efficient topology-informed model to fully automatically extract personalized ECG standard electrode locations from 2D clinically standard cardiac MRIs. Specifically, we obtain the sparse torso contours from the cardiac MRIs and then localize the standard electrodes of 12-lead ECG from the contours. Cardiac MRIs aim at imaging of the heart instead of the torso, leading to incomplete torso geometry within the imaging. To tackle the missing topology, we incorporate the electrodes as a subset of the keypoints, which can be explicitly aligned with the 3D torso topology. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the time-consuming conventional model projection-based method in terms of accuracy (Euclidean distance: 1.24\u00b10.293 cm vs. 1.48\u00b10.362 cm) and efficiency (2 s vs. 30-35 min). We further demonstrate the effectiveness of using the detected electrodes for in-silico ECG simulation, highlighting their potential for creating accurate and efficient CDT models. The code is available at https://github.com/lileitech/12lead_ECG_electrode_localizer.",

A key strategy relies on the possibility to incorporate clinical, biomarker, image-based, and dosimetric information in theranostic digital twins (TDTs) of patients to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach. The TDT framework enables treatment optimization by real-time monitoring of the real-world system, simulation of different treatment scenarios, and prediction of resulting treatment outcomes, as well as facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing among health care professionals adopting a harmonized TDT. To this aim, the major social, ethical, and regulatory challenges related to TDT implementation and adoption have been analyzed. ",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twinning is a special case of monozygotic, monoamniotic twinning. Human conjoined twinning, and vertebrate conjoined twinning in general, is a very rare phenomenon. It has been suggested that the risk of conjoined twinning increases with some medication and upon assisted reproduction. Survival rates are low. When conjoined twins occur in the chicken, they most often present with fused heads, anatomically unrecognisable brains and two normal bodies. Recent studies suggested that forebrain, midbrain and rostral hindbrain identities are established in the early epiblast before neural induction and independent from caudal hindbrain and spinal cord identities. Therefore, it is unclear whether in conjoined twins, the aberrant brain anatomy is a result of the rostral fusion, or whether the brains failed to develop in the first place. Here, we collected conjoined twins as they spontaneously appeared in eggs incubated for stages HH4 (late primitive steak stage) to HH13 (early pharyngula). The twinned embryos and stage-matched normal embryos were analysed for the expression of the rostral epiblast and forebrain-midbrain marker Otx2 and the ventral forebrain marker Six3. We found normal anatomy and marker gene expression that lasted up to stage HH9. By HH12-13, the brain anatomy had deteriorated, but marker genes remained expressed. This suggests that the fusing embryos attempted to generate a brain including the forebrain. Besides addressing forebrain development, our work for the first time provides a time frame to study the mechanisms underlying the interaction and fusion of conjoined twins, which will pave the way to a better understanding and management of risk factors in humans.",

    "abstract": "Understanding clinical trajectories of sepsis patients is crucial for prognostication, resource planning, and to inform digital twin models of critical illness. This study aims to identify common clinical trajectories based on dynamic assessment of cardiorespiratory support using a validated electronic health record data that covers retrospective cohort of 19,177 patients with sepsis admitted to ICUs of Mayo Clinic Hospitals over eight-year period. Patient trajectories were modeled from ICU admission up to 14 days using an unsupervised machine learning two-stage clustering method based on cardiorespiratory support in ICU and hospital discharge status. Of 19,177 patients, 42% were female with a median age of 65 (IQR, 55-76) years, APACHE III score of 70 (IQR, 56-87), hospital length of stay (LOS) of 7 (IQR, 4-12) days, and ICU LOS of 2 (IQR, 1-4) days. Four distinct trajectories were identified: fast recovery (27% with a mortality rate of 3.5% and median hospital LOS of 3 (IQR, 2-15) days), slow recovery (62% with a mortality rate of 3.6% and hospital LOS of 8 (IQR, 6-13) days), fast decline (4% with a mortality rate of 99.7% and hospital LOS of 1 (IQR, 0-1) day), and delayed decline (7% with a mortality rate of 97.9% and hospital LOS of 5 (IQR, 3-8) days). Distinct trajectories remained robust and were distinguished by Charlston comorbidity index, Apache III scores, day 1 and day 3 SOFA (p < 0.001 ANOVA). These findings provide a foundation for developing prediction models and digital twin decision support tools, improving both shared decision-making and resource planning.",

    "abstract": "Fivefold twins are extensively present in nanoparticles and nanowires, enhancing their performance in physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. However, a deep insight into the correlation between mechanical properties and fivefold twins in bulk nanograined materials is lacking due to synthesis difficulties. Here, a bulk fivefold-twinned nanograined Ni is synthesized via electrodeposition. The fivefold-twinned nanograins typically feature decahedral and icosahedral shapes similar to fivefold-twinned particles. The material exhibits a yield strength of \u22481.7\u00a0GPa under both compression and tension. Tensile samples achieve an ultimate strength of 2.15\u00a0GPa with 15% elongation to failure. The plastic deformation is accommodated by partial dislocation sliding on twin boundaries, splitting fivefold twins, and abnormally refining grains. The size dependence of nucleation stress for partial dislocation is responsible for strengthening and strain hardening. The results showcase the potential of incorporating fivefold twins into bulk nanocrystalline materials to tailor mechanical properties and applications across diverse fields.",

    "abstract": "Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS) is a genetic disorder characterized by intrauterine and postnatal growth restriction. Most cases are caused by an imprinting error either with hypomethylation of the Imprinted Control Region 1 at 11p15.5, or maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7. Approximately 40% of the cases have unknown etiology, thus distinct mechanisms have been described in association with the syndrome. Here, we present a case of monozygotic twin sisters with a clinical diagnosis of SRS, mild intellectual disability and epilepsy who carry a balanced translocation between chromosomes 3 and 12 that interrupts the NAALADL2 and HMGA2 genes, respectively. Disruption of HMGA2, a gene previously described as causative of SRS, confirms the initial diagnosis. NAALADL2 gene has been recently proposed as a candidate for intellectual disability and could partially contribute to our patient's phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Research to identify fetal predictors of infant mortality among singletons born in the United States (US) concludes that poorly understood and unmeasured \"confounders\" produce a spurious association between fetal size and infant death. We argue that these confounders include Vanishing Twin Syndrome (VTS)-the clinical manifestation of selection against frail male twins \nWe use Box-Jenkins transfer function modeling to test the hypothesis that among infants born from 276 monthly conception cohorts conceived in the US from January 1995 through December 2017, the sex ratio of twins born in the 37th week of gestation will correlate inversely with infant mortality among singleton males born at the 40th week of gestation.\nWe find support for our hypothesis and infer that the contribution of survivors of VTS to temporal variation in infant mortality among the hardiest of singleton male infants, those born at 40 weeks gestation, ranged from a decrease of about 7% to an increase of about 5% over our 276 monthly conception cohorts.\nWe conclude that an evolutionary perspective on fetal loss makes a heretofore \"unmeasured confounder\" of the relationship between fetal size and infant mortality both explicable and measurable. This finding may help clinicians better anticipate changes over time in the incidence of infant mortality.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation (DNAm) has been shown in multiple studies to be associated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). However, studies focusing on Chinese populations are lacking. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study to investigate the association between DNAm and eGFR in Chinese monozygotic twins.\nGenome-wide DNAm level was detected using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing test. Generalized estimation equation (GEE) was used to examine the association between Cytosine-phosphate-Guanines (CpGs) DNAm and eGFR. Inference about Causation from Examination of FAmiliaL CONfounding was employed to infer the causal relationship. The comb-p was used to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs). GeneMANIA was used to analyze the gene interaction network. The Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool enriched biological functions and pathways. Gene expression profiling sequencing was employed to measure mRNA expression levels, and the GEE model was used to investigate the association between gene expression and eGFR. The candidate gene was validated in a community population by calculating the methylation risk score (MRS).\nA total of 80 CpGs and 28 DMRs, located at genes such as OLIG2, SYNGR3, LONP1, CDCP1, and SHANK1, achieved genome-wide significance level (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05). The causal effect of DNAm on eGFR was supported by 12 CpGs located at genes such as SYNGR3 and C9orf3. In contrast, the causal effect of eGFR on DNAm is proved by 13 CpGs located at genes such as EPHB3 and MLLT1. Enrichment analysis revealed several important biological functions and pathways related to eGFR, including alpha-2A adrenergic receptor binding pathway and corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor activity pathway. GeneMANIA results showed that SYNGR3 was co-expressed with MLLT1 and had genetic interactions with AFF4 and EDIL3. Gene expression analysis found that SYNGR3 expression was negatively associated with eGFR. Validation analysis showed that the MRS of SYNGR3 was positively associated with low eGFR levels.\nWe identified a set of CpGs, DMRs, and pathways potentially associated with eGFR, particularly in the SYNGR3 gene. These findings provided new insights into the epigenetic modifications related to the decline in eGFR and chronic kidney disease.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins, although rare, present unique challenges in surgical management, particularly regarding skin closure after separation. This case report details the successful separation of pygopagus conjoined twins using a rectangular skin flap technique. The twins, joined at the lumbar and sacral regions, underwent meticulous preoperative planning and collaborative effort from multiple medical teams. The surgery involved raising fasciocutaneous rectangular flaps over the buttocks, spine separation, rectal division, and reconstruction of pelvic floor muscles. The primary skin closure was achieved successfully. This case highlights the superior gluteal-based rectangular flap technique in such a separation and the importance of multidisciplinary approaches in improving outcomes for complex surgeries.",

    "abstract": "Arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by elongation and tortuosity of the aorta and mid-sized arteries. Additional features typical of connective tissue disorders are usually present, but the clinical presentation of the syndrome can extensively change. The cardiovascular implications are the major source of morbidity and mortality and can be present even during the neonatal period; therefore, a correct neonatal management is extremely important. However, only few cases of ATS have been suspected or diagnosed prenatally.\nIn our study, we present a rare case of dichorionic twins both affected by ATS, in which the syndrome was suspected antenatally. Moreover, we performed a review of the literature and summarized the main findings identified at prenatal ultrasounds and postnatal examination, in order to help clinicians with the management of this rare diagnosis.\nThe most suspicious ultrasound prenatal finding of ATS is the elongation and tortuosity of great arteries. When ATS is suspected prenatally, the newborn should be referred immediately after birth to a high specialized center for proper neonatal care. In case of confirmed ATS, parents should be counseled regarding the recurrence risk in other pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins with amniotic fluid abnormalities that do not meet criteria for twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) concern physicians and families. This study aimed to describe the natural history of amniotic fluid abnormalities.\nIn this retrospective case-control study, TTTS screening ultrasounds and clinical records throughout all MCDA twin gestations were reviewed between 2018 and 2022 at a tertiary fetal care center. Twin pairs with normal imaging throughout gestation comprised a control group. Cases with fluid abnormalities were divided into four subgroups: (1) isolated polyhydramnios of one twin, (2) isolated oligohydramnios of one twin, (3) subjective physician concern about fluid discrepancy without objectively abnormal fluid in either twin, (4) or selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) with any of the above fluid abnormalities. Since the aim was to trend unclear fluid findings, twins who flipped from normal imaging to clear diagnostic criteria for TTTS, selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR), or twin-anemia polycythemia sequence (TAPS) within one scan were excluded. Also excluded were gestations with structural anomalies affecting fluid quantity, higher order multiples, and cases with only one scan available.\nOf 737 gestations, 300 were excluded for clear diagnostic findings, 19 had a fetal anomaly impacting fluid, 10 were higher order multiples, and 44 had only one scan. Of the remaining 364, 224 had normal imaging and formed the control group, while 140 had fluid abnormalities not diagnostic for TTTS. Twins with fluid abnormalities developed more TTTS (41\u00a0%), TAPS (8\u00a0%), new-onset sFGR (11\u00a0%), and need for laser (36\u00a0% vs 0\u00a0%, all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Fetal demise (11\u00a0% vs 1\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and maternal admissions for fetal surveillance (15\u00a0% vs 4\u00a0% p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) were seen more often in cases, who also had an earlier gestational age at delivery (33.1 vs 35.1\u00a0weeks, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) when compared to controls.\nAmniotic fluid abnormalities that do not yet meet criteria for TTTS should be considered a warning sign in MCDA twin pregnancies. These abnormalities are associated with more complications, fetal intervention, fetal demise, and long hospital stays.",

    "abstract": "We aim to study the potential association between tattoo ink exposure and development of certain types of cancers in the recently established Danish Twin Tattoo Cohort. Tattoo ink is known to transfer from skin to blood and accumulate in regional lymph nodes. We are concerned that tattoo ink induces inflammation at the deposit site, leading to chronic inflammation and increasing risk of abnormal cell proliferation, especially skin cancer and lymphoma.\nWe conducted two designs of twin studies to improve confounder control: A cohort study of 2,367 randomly selected twins and a case-control study of 316 twins born in the period 1960-1996. Cancer diagnoses (ICD-10) were retrieved from the Danish Cancer Registry and tattoo ink exposure from the Danish Twin Tattoo survey from 2021. The analysis addressed effects of time-varying exposure.\nIn the case-control study, individual-level analysis resulted in a hazard of skin cancer (of any type except basal cell carcinoma) that was 1.62 times higher among tattooed individuals (95% CI: 1.08-2.41). Twin-matched analysis of 14 twin pairs discordant for tattoo ink exposure and skin cancer showed HR\u2009=\u20091.33 (95% CI: 0.46-3.84). For skin cancer and lymphoma, increased hazards were found for tattoos larger than the palm of a hand: HR\u2009=\u20092.37 (95% CI: 1.11-5.06) and HR\u2009=\u20092.73 (95% CI: 1.33-5.60), respectively. In the cohort study design, individual-level analysis resulted in a hazard ratio of 3.91 (95% CI: 1.42-10.8) for skin cancer and 2.83 (95% CI: 1.30-6.16) for basal cell carcinoma.\nIn conclusion, our study suggests an increased hazard of lymphoma and skin cancers among tattooed individuals, demonstrated through two designs: a twin cohort and a case-cotwin study. We are concerned that tattoo ink interacting with surrounding cells may have severe consequences. Studies that pinpoint the etiological pathway of tattoo ink induced carcinogenesis are recommended to benefit public health.",

    "abstract": "Tongue tie is an added complication when breastfeeding, but little is known about the role tongue tie might play when breastfeeding twins.\nTwins are much less likely to be breastfed than singleton babies due to added complications regarding pregnancy, birth and ongoing care. Tongue tie can cause breastfeeding barriers including poor latch, inefficient milk transfer and nipple pain.\nThe aim of this study was to conduct an in-depth exploration of the experiences of mothers who have breastfeed twins with suspected or diagnosed tongue tie.\nInterview and qualitative survey data exploring the experience of breastfeeding twins and multiples were analysed with a focus on the experiences of participants reporting on suspected or diagnosed tongue tie. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.\nThree themes were developed. These were: 1) feeling disempowered by tongue tie denial; which illustrated the experience of dismissal by healthcare professionals, 2) the avoidable impact of diagnostic delay; highlighting the practical, physical and psychological impact of tongue tie, and 3) improvements following intervention; illustrating the immediate improvements experienced following frenotomy.\nMothers who suspect tongue tie find themselves disempowered by denial of their experiences and needing to fight for intervention. Long delays lead to distress for both mother and child while intervention often leads to instant improvement.\nImproved healthcare professional training and healthcare policy changes are needed to improve tongue tie support and intervention for parents of twins and reduce the threat to mother and child health and wellbeing.\nProblem or Issue: Breastfeeding rates for twins are much lower than for singleton babies. For some infants tongue tie may be an additional barrier to breastfeeding success.\nResearch with parents of singleton babies has shown that tongue tie can cause distress, frustration and physical pain for mothers who report dismissal by healthcare professionals and a need to fight for support.\nThe voices of parents of infants with tongue tie who have successfully breastfed twins are presented. Like parents of singleton infants, they experienced diagnostic delays and psychological and physical impacts of tongue tie. Intervention was often sought privately when NHS support was lacking. Regardless of source, tongue tie intervention often led to immediate improvement highlighting how the added stresses and challenges created by tongue tie for twin parents could be prevented with appropriate support and intervention following birth.",

    "abstract": "Scoliosis is an idiopathic three-dimensional spine strain. The orthopedic parameter used to diagnose and evaluate the severity of the strain is Cobb's angle. This study proposes using this clinical parameter to reproduce a digital twin of the spine, calculate biomechanical stress changes, and characterize idiopathic scoliosis deformity through symmetrical degeneration of intervertebral discs, relying on patient-specific radiological measurements of the scoliotic curves.\nA three-dimensional computational model of the spine was developed, where patient-specific curves were generated by modifying intervertebral disc mechanical properties via a mathematical model derived from radiological data. Validation of the model was performed by comparing the resultant scoliotic curves with patient radiological images. Finite element analysis was then used to elucidate the biomechanical effects on the spine due to the deformity.\nThe model successfully replicated patient-specific thoracic scoliotic deformities, revealing a discernible relationship between disc strain and its proximity to the apex, indicating a heightened risk of disc stress closer to the apex. Moreover, \"type-C\" curves exhibited a greater risk of herniation compared to \"type-S\" curves due to differences in compressive stress distribution.\nThis modeling approach enhances the understanding of scoliosis biomechanics, facilitating risk assessment for disc prolapse and aiding in treatment selection, including the design of condition-specific orthotics. Furthermore, it establishes a quantitative link between scoliosis severity and disc strain, integrating Cobb's angle and other orthopedic parameters into computational models to approximate patient-specific conditions.",

    "abstract": "Power transformers play a crucial role in enabling the integration of renewable energy sources and improving the overall efficiency and reliability of smart grid systems. They facilitate the conversion, transmission, and distribution of power from various sources and help to balance the load between different parts of the grid. The Transformer Health Index (THI) is one of the most important indicators of ensuring their reliability and preventing unplanned outages. To this end, this study introduces a proposed new architecture called a Smart Electricity Monitoring System based on Fog Computing and Digital Twins (SEMS-FDT) for monitoring the health performance of transformers by measuring the THI rate in real time. The SEMS-FDT is specifically designed to enable the observation of the transformer's health and performance purposes in real time. The study investigates the role of machine learning (ML) models, including traditional and ensemble methods, in predicting THI and LI (Heat Load Index) by exploring the use of the entire set of features and optimized feature subsets for prediction. To improve the forecasting prediction process and achieve optimal performance a novel multitasks LSTM_GRU model is also proposed. The experimental results demonstrate that there is a promising performance of 2.543, 0.13646, 0.0284, and 0.985 for MSE, MAE, MedAE, and R2 scores respectively. Moreover, the framework is extended by incorporating model explanations, which include global explanations, which provide insights based on the entire dataset, and local explanations, which offer instance-specific explanations. The integration of the proposed model and explainability features provides engineers with comprehensive outcomes regarding the model's result.",

    "abstract": "The health care industry must align with new digital technologies to respond to existing and new challenges. Digital twins (DTs) are an emerging technology for digital transformation and applied intelligence that is rapidly attracting attention. DTs are virtual representations of products, systems, or processes that interact bidirectionally in real time with their actual counterparts. Although DTs have diverse applications from personalized care to treatment optimization, misconceptions persist regarding their definition and the extent of their implementation within health systems.\nThis study aimed to review DT applications in health care, particularly for clinical decision-making (CDM) and operational decision-making (ODM). It provides a definition and framework for DTs by exploring their unique elements and characteristics. Then, it assesses the current advances and extent of DT applications to support CDM and ODM using the defined DT characteristics.\nWe conducted a scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) protocol. We searched multiple databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus, for original research articles describing DT technologies applied to CDM and ODM in health systems. Papers proposing only ideas or frameworks or describing DT capabilities without experimental data were excluded. We collated several available types of information, for example, DT characteristics, the environment that DTs were tested within, and the main underlying method, and used descriptive statistics to analyze the synthesized data.\nOut of 5537 relevant papers, 1.55% (86/5537) met the predefined inclusion criteria, all published after 2017. The majority focused on CDM (75/86, 87%). Mathematical modeling (24/86, 28%) and simulation techniques (17/86, 20%) were the most frequently used methods. Using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision coding, we identified 3 key areas of DT applications as follows: factors influencing diseases of the circulatory system (14/86, 16%); health status and contact with health services (12/86, 14%); and endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases (10/86, 12%). Only 16 (19%) of 86 studies tested the developed system in a real environment, while the remainder were evaluated in simulated settings. Assessing the studies against defined DT characteristics reveals that the developed systems have yet to materialize the full capabilities of DTs.\nThis study provides a comprehensive review of DT applications in health care, focusing on CDM and ODM. A key contribution is the development of a framework that defines important elements and characteristics of DTs in the context of related literature. The DT applications studied in this paper reveal encouraging results that allow us to envision that, in the near future, they will play an important role not only in the diagnosis and prevention of diseases but also in other areas, such as efficient clinical trial design, as well as personalized and optimized treatments.",

    "results": "Out of 5537 relevant papers, 1.55% (86/5537) met the predefined inclusion criteria, all published after 2017. The majority focused on CDM (75/86, 87%). Mathematical modeling (24/86, 28%) and simulation techniques (17/86, 20%) were the most frequently used methods. Using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision coding, we identified 3 key areas of DT applications as follows: factors influencing diseases of the circulatory system (14/86, 16%); health status and contact with health services (12/86, 14%); and endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases (10/86, 12%). Only 16 (19%) of 86 studies tested the developed system in a real environment, while the remainder were evaluated in simulated settings. Assessing the studies against defined DT characteristics reveals that the developed systems have yet to materialize the full capabilities of DTs.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic (MC) twins share a single placenta which can be unequally shared, leading to selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR). Limited data is available on the prevalence and clinical consequences of proximate cord insertion (PCI) in sFGR pregnancies.\nWe aimed to investigate the prevalence of PCI in MC placentas with and without sFGR and per type of sFGR, and study the placental characteristics and perinatal outcome of PCI in sFGR pregnancies.\nIn this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we included all consecutive placentas of MC twin pregnancies with and without sFGR evaluated between 2002-2023. We excluded MC twins with twin-twin transfusion syndrome, twin anemia polycythemia sequence and monoamnionicity. Our primary outcome included the prevalence of PCI (distance between cord insertions \u22644 cm) and type of cord insertions categorized as concordant, intermediate or discordant. Secondary outcomes consisted of type and size of placental vascular anastomoses and short-term clinical outcomes including fetal demise and birth weight discordance (BWD).\nOf 813 MC placentas, 468 were from uncomplicated twins and 345 from sFGR twins (187 type I, 41 type II and 117 type III sFGR). The prevalence of PCI in uncomplicated versus sFGR placentas was 3.8% (18/468) and 4.6% (16/345), respectively (p=0.58). PCI in sFGR type I, II and III was detected in 0.5% (1/187), 0% (0/41) and 12.8% (15/117), respectively (p<0.0001). The prevalence of discordant cord insertions (velamentous-paracentral) in uncomplicated twin placentas and sFGR placentas was 19.9% (93/468) and 45.5% (157/345), respectively (p<0.0001). Diameter of arterio-arterial (AA) anastomoses in sFGR placentas with and without PCI was 3.0 mm (IQR 2.7-5.0) versus 2.2 mm (IQR 1.4-3.1; p<0.0061). BWD in sFGR twins with PCI was 18.5% (IQR 16.4-21.0) and without PCI was 28.0% (IQR 21.8-35.9; p<0.0001). Fetal demise occurred in 12.5% (2/16) of pregnancies with PCI and 6.1% (20/329) of sFGR pregnancies without PCI (p=0.27).\nsFGR type III placentas exhibit a high prevalence of PCI, requiring increased awareness due to the presence of larger AA anastomoses and a potentially higher risk of fetal demise.",

The prevalence of PCI in uncomplicated versus sFGR placentas was 3.8% (18/468) and 4.6% (16/345), respectively (p=0.58). PCI in sFGR type I, II and III was detected in 0.5% (1/187), 0% (0/41) and 12.8% (15/117), respectively (p<0.0001). The prevalence of discordant cord insertions (velamentous-paracentral) in uncomplicated twin placentas and sFGR placentas was 19.9% (93/468) and 45.5% (157/345), respectively (p<0.0001). Diameter of arterio-arterial (AA) anastomoses in sFGR placentas with and without PCI was 3.0 mm (IQR 2.7-5.0) versus 2.2 mm (IQR 1.4-3.1; p<0.0061). BWD in sFGR twins with PCI was 18.5% (IQR 16.4-21.0) and without PCI was 28.0% (IQR 21.8-35.9; p<0.0001).

    "abstract": "Antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) administration before anticipated preterm birth is one of the most important interventions available to improve neonatal outcomes. Nevertheless, this treatment is associated with an increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. The aim of this study was to determine whether preterm twins who receive ACS are at increased risk for developing neonatal hypoglycemia.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of indicated and spontaneous preterm births of twins at a single center between 2011 and 2018. The study population included 3 groups matched for gestational age at delivery and birth weight: (1) Twin neonates who received a course of ACS 1-7 days before birth (n = 532); (2) twins who did not receive ACS at that time interval (n = 532); and (3) singletons receiving ACS 1-7 days before birth (n = 266). The primary outcome was neonatal hypoglycemia (<40 mg/dL/2.2 mmol/L) within the first 24 h and 48 h of life.\nThe rate of neonatal hypoglycemia during the first 24 h of life was significantly higher in singletons exposed to ACS compared to twins not exposed to ACS (p = 0.019) and in twins exposed to ACS compared to twins not exposed to ACS (p = 0.047). The rate of neonatal hypoglycemia was almost identical between twins and singletons exposed to ACS (p = 0.72). Regression analysis revealed that exposure to ACS and birth weight were independently associated with neonatal hypoglycemia after adjustment for maternal age, body mass index, gravidity, gestational diabetes mellitus, and gestational age at delivery.\nExposure to ACS, rather than plurality, is associated with short-lived neonatal hypoglycemia.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins, or Siamese twins as they are commonly called, are a rare and extreme form of monochorionic twinning. Imaging plays an essential role in the diagnosis and follow-up of conjoined twins. While ultrasound is often the screening modality of choice, MRI is carried out for better anatomical delineation and further characterization as and when necessary. We present a unique case of first trimester thoraco-omphalopagus conjoined twins with cystic hygroma who were comprehensively evaluated with sonography and MRI with imaging findings confirmed post-pregnancy termination. The case stresses upon the utility of advanced imaging techniques including foetal MRI that immensely contribute towards a reliable diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Current outcomes from catheter ablation for scar-dependent ventricular tachycardia (VT) are limited by high recurrence rates and long procedure durations. Personalized heart digital twin technology presents a noninvasive method of predicting critical substrate in VT, and its integration into clinical VT ablation offers a promising solution. The accuracy of the predictions of digital twins to detect invasive substrate abnormalities is unknown. We present the first prospective analysis of digital twin technology in predicting critical substrate abnormalities in VT.\nHeart digital twin models were created from 18 patients with scar-dependent VT undergoing catheter ablation. Contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance images were used to reconstruct finite-element meshes, onto which regional electrophysiological properties were applied. Rapid-pacing protocols were used to induce VTs and to define the VT circuits. Predicted optimum ablation sites to terminate all VTs in the models were identified. Invasive substrate mapping was performed, and the digital twins were merged with the electroanatomical map. Electrogram abnormalities and regions of conduction slowing were compared between digital twin-predicted sites and nonpredicted areas.\nElectrogram abnormalities were significantly more frequent in digital twin-predicted sites compared with nonpredicted sites (468/1029 [45.5%] versus 519/1611 [32.2%]; \nDigital twin-predicted sites display a higher prevalence of abnormal and prolonged electrograms compared with nonpredicted sites and accurately identify regions of conduction slowing. Digital twin technology may help improve substrate-based VT ablation.\nURL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT04632394.",

    "abstract": "Suboptimal diets increase morbidity and mortality risk. Epigenetic clocks are algorithms that can assess health and lifespan, even at a young age, before clinical manifestations of diseases. We investigated the association between dietary patterns and biological aging in young adult twins.\nThe data were drawn from the population-based FinnTwin12 study and consisted of twins aged 21-25 years (n\u00a0=\u00a0826). Food and beverage intakes were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Biological aging was estimated using the epigenetic clocks GrimAge and DunedinPACE. Latent class analysis was used to identify dietary patterns. The association between dietary patterns and biological aging was assessed using linear regression modeling at the individual level, followed by within-twin pair analyses to account for genetic liabilities and shared familial confounders.\nSix dietary patterns were identified: 1) High fast food, low fruits and vegetables (F&V), 2) Plant-based, 3) Health-conscious, 4) Western with infrequent fish, 5) Western with regular fish, and 6) Balanced average. At the individual level, GrimAge acceleration was slower in the Plant-based, Health-conscious, and Balanced-average patterns compared to the High fast food, low F&V, and faster in the Western with infrequent fish pattern compared to the Balanced average, regardless of sex, nonalcoholic energy intake, smoking, and alcohol consumption. After further adjustment for BMI and sports participation, the strengths of the associations modestly decreased; however, the difference between the Balanced-average and High fast food, low F&V patterns remained significant. The pace of aging (DunedinPACE) was slower in the Plant-based pattern compared to the High fast food, low F&V and the Western with infrequent fish patterns after adjustment for sex, nonalcoholic energy intake, smoking, and alcohol. The effect sizes were attenuated and reached a non-significant level when BMI and sports participation were added to the model. Most of the associations were replicated in the within-pair analyses among all twin pairs and among dizygotic twin pairs, but the effect sizes tended to be smaller among monozygotic twin pairs. This suggests that genetics, but not a shared environment, may partially explain the observed associations between diet and biological aging.\nDiets high in fast food, processed red meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages and low in fruits and vegetables are associated with accelerated biological aging in young adulthood. The clustering effect of lifestyle factors and genetic confounders should be considered when interpreting the findings.",

    "abstract": "How are the changing maternal age structure and population growth expected to shape future twinning rates in low-income countries?\nWith maternal age at birth projected to shift toward older ages, twinning rates are also estimated to increase in most low-income countries by 2050 and even more by 2100.\nMany of the sub-Saharan African and South Asian countries are undergoing, and projected to further experience, the shift of maternal age at birth to older ages. Advanced maternal age is a well-established predictor of multiple births at the individual level, but currently, it is unknown how the changes in maternal age distribution are associated with the changes in twinning rates at the population level in low-income countries.\nWe first estimated age-specific twinning probability based on Demographic Health Surveys and World Fertility Surveys data. We then scaled up the age-specific twinning probability at the population level to estimate changes in the number of twin births in 2050 and 2100 attributable to the estimated shifts in maternal age toward older ages as projected by the UN World Population Prospects (WPP).\nWe analyzed \u223c3.19 million births that occurred within 10\u2009years before the interview. Majority of the births in our data took place between 1980 and 2015 across 39 countries, where the uptake of medically assisted reproduction (MAR) is known to have been low during the observation period. We estimated country fixed-effects models to obtain country-specific twinning rates and age-specific twinning probability. We applied these estimates to the future number of births projected by the UN WPP, to estimate the number of twin births in 2050 and 2100.\nWith maternal age at birth projected to shift toward older ages, twinning rates are also estimated to increase in most countries by 2050 compared to 2010 (increases from 0.3% to 63% depending on countries), and even more in all studied countries by 2100 (increases from 3.5% to 79%). Due to its large population size, India will continue to have among the largest share of twin births despite its estimated decline of twin births by 10.5% by 2100. Nigeria, due to its not only large and growing population size but also high twinning rate, is expected to contribute the second largest number of twin births.\nAlthough the accuracy in maternal recall of multiple births tends to be high, our use of data based on recalled births from the past nonetheless imply a potential bias in our estimation of twinning rates.\nThe present study suggests that, even if the spread of MAR remains slow in many low-income countries, twinning rates and number of twin births are expected to grow as an increase in maternal age at birth and population growth continue. Our findings call for more public health attention and societal support to be paid to twins and their families in low-income countries, given that twins are at higher risk of developmental challenges and health disadvantages.\nD.S.L. was supported by the European Union (ERC, BIOSFER, 101071773).

    "abstract": "This case presents a unique age estimation involving Chinese Tibetan twins, where one of them has been arrested for alleged rape. His parents claimed he was about 13\u00a0years old without providing any official age documentation. Since age is important in criminal proceedings in China, bone age estimation was conducted to determine the chronological age of the twins. The twins underwent a physical examination, X-rays of the left hand/wrist, and pelvis, and a CT scan of the clavicle. Two age estimation standards in China were used: \"Skeletal Maturity and Assessment Methods of Hand and Wrist for Chinese\" (China-05 standard), and \"Technical Specifications for Skeletal Age Evaluation of Han Population Teenagers\" (TSSHPT standard). The bone radiographs showed that most of the twins' epiphyseal development was similar, with only slight differences observed in the distal radius, distal ulna, and iliac crest apophysis. The results of the two methods showed differences in the range of predicted ages. Applying the RUS-CHN method to hand/wrist images, the estimated age of the suspect was determined to be 16-16.5\u00a0years old, while his brother's age was 15.5-16\u00a0years old. Applying the TSSHPT standard to all three images, the estimated age of the suspect was 17-17.5\u00a0years old, while his brother's age was estimated to be 16.5-17\u00a0years old. In this case, two commonly used methods for age estimation were introduced. The disparity in age estimations using the RUS-CHN and TSSHPT standards, with the age of the suspect ranging from 16 to 17.5\u00a0years. This case revealed that the choice of bone age estimation method can significantly impact the result of estimated age, which has important implications for legal proceedings. Additionally, the minor differences in skeletal maturity between the twins emphasize the need to account for individual variations, even among genetically similar individuals. Furthermore, this case contributes to the broader discourse on the effectiveness of skeletal age estimation methods across diverse populations, underscoring the necessity for tailored evaluation standards that consider genetic and environmental diversity.",

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disease caused by deficient lysosomal glycogen degradation, and includes both late-onset (LOPD) and severe infantile-onset (IOPD) phenotypes. Due to very small patient numbers in IOPD and the high phenotypic heterogeneity observed in this population, a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP)-based \"digital twin\" approach was developed to perform an in silico comparison of the efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa vs. the standard of care, in a virtual population of IOPD patients. A QSP model was developed that represents key elements of Pompe disease pathophysiology, including tissue glycogen accumulation and the elevation of the biomarker urine Hex4 in both LOPD and IOPD patients. In this approach, the QSP model was used to generate digital twins of each IOPD patient enrolled in the avalglucosidase alfa clinical program, considering their respective disease burden, demographics, and treatment history. This virtual cohort supplemented clinical observations by simulating and comparing tissue glycogen and urine Hex4 following avalglucosidase alfa treatment vs. the standard of care. The digital twin analysis supports the interpretation that the enhanced reduction in urine Hex4 observed following avalglucosidase alfa treatment is attributable to greater tissue glycogen clearance. Overall, this study provides mechanism-based insight into avalglucosidase alfa efficacy across the phenotypic spectrum of Pompe disease and demonstrates the value of applying a QSP-based digital twin analysis to support rare disease drug development.",

    "abstract": "Dicephalic parapagus conjoined twins, a rarely occurring form of conjoined twinning has poor prognosis and remains a significant cause of perinatal deaths. Since majority of cases of conjoined twins are not compatible with life, early and reliable detection with diagnostic medical imaging remains crucial for adequate patient counselling, medical and surgical management. We present a case of dicephalic parapagus twin gestation with associated congenital anomalies detected for the first time with ultrasound in the third trimester in a 29-year-old pregnant woman. An initial first trimester ultrasound at 14 weeks gestational age was unremarkable. Ultrasound fetal anatomical survey in the third trimester remains reliable for the detection of rare fetal anomalies such as dicephalic parapagus twins that might have been missed in earlier scans. Continuous efforts should therefore be made for the inclusion of detailed anatomical survey in the early third trimester; particularly in women with unremarkable earlier ultrasound scans and in those reporting late for obstetric care.",

    "abstract": "To compare histopathological findings of placentas of dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies of in-vitro fertilization (IVF), conceived after fresh embryo transfer (ET) and frozen-thawed ET.\nThis retrospective study compared dichorionic diamniotic twin IVF pregnancies that resulted in livebirths during 2010-2022. The placental findings were classified according to definitions curated by the 2016 Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group Consensus Statement. A multivariate logistic analysis was constructed to estimate the odds ratios (OR) of placental histopathology abnormal findings, adjusted for maternal age, body mass index and nulliparity.\nThe mean gestational age at birth was lower following fresh ET pregnancies (n\u00a0=\u00a0236) than frozen-thawed ET pregnancies (n\u00a0=\u00a0122) (34.89 vs 35.77 weeks, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). For the fresh ET compared to the frozen-thawed ET group, rates were higher of preterm birth (69.5\u00a0% vs. 55.7\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011), low birthweight (71.6\u00a0% vs 57.4\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and very low birthweight (14.2\u00a0% vs 9.0\u00a0%, p value one sided\u00a0=\u00a00.029). For the fresh ET compared with the frozen-thawed ET group, the rates were higher of maternal vascular lesions (20.3\u00a0% vs. 11.5\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), placental hemorrhage (12.7\u00a0% vs. 7\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.021), and villous lesions related to maternal vascular lesions (7.2\u00a0% vs. 3.7\u00a0%, p value one sided\u00a0=\u00a00.04). A multivariate logistic analysis showed a higher risk of maternal or neonatal vascular lesions for twin pregnancies after fresh ET than frozen-thawed ET (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a01.91, 95\u00a0% CI 1.26-2.92, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011).\nFollowing fresh ET compared to frozen-thawed ET, obstetrical and neonatal outcomes were worse, and the risk of maternal vascular lesions was greater.",

    "abstract": "A Digital Twin (DT) can be understood as a representation of a real asset, a virtual replica of a physical object, process, or even a system. They have been used in managing healthcare facilities, streamlining care processes, personalizing treatments, and enhancing patient recovery. The potential impact of this tool on our society and its well-being is quite significant. A quick review of the literature was carried out using the terms ('Digital Twins') and ('Digital Health'), and (Health Care) with a time interval of up to 5\u2009years (2018-23). Using the PRISMA Method, the search was conducted in six academic databases: IEEE Xplore, Dimensions, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and ACM. After applying the search strings and the exclusion criteria, a total of 13 publications were identified and listed to constitute and support the discussion of this article. The selected studies were categorized into 2 groups according to their application in healthcare: A group of clinical applications, subdivided into topics on personalized care and reproduction of biological structures and another group of operational applications, subdivided into topics such as optimization of operational processes, reproduction of physical structures, and development of devices and drugs. The use of DT in healthcare presents important challenges related to data integration, privacy, and interoperability. However, trends indicate exciting potential in personalizing treatment, prevention, remote monitoring, informed decision-making, and process management, which can result in significant improvements in quality and efficiency in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise for revolutionizing healthcare. This narrative review focuses on the evolving discussion of the utility of AI and clinical informatics in critical care and acute care medicine, specifically focusing on digital twin (DT) technology. The improved computational power and iterative validation of these intelligent tools have enhanced medical education, in silico research, and clinical decision support in critical care settings. Integrating DTs into critical care opens vast opportunities, but simultaneously poses complex challenges, from data safety and privacy concerns to potentially increasing healthcare disparities. In medicine, DTs can significantly improve the efficiency of critical care systems. Stakeholder investment is essential for successful implementation and integration of these technologies.",

    "abstract": "Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) have become the new buzzword for researchers, planners, policymakers, and industry experts when it comes to designing, planning, and managing sustainable and efficient cities. It encapsulates the last iteration of the technocratic and ultra-efficient, post-modernist vision of smart cities. However, while more applications branded as UDTs appear around the world, its conceptualization remains ambiguous. Beyond being technically prescriptive about what UDTs are, this article focuses on their aspects of interaction and operationalization in connection to people in cities, and how enhanced by metaverse ideas they can deepen societal divides by offering divergent urban experiences based on different stakeholder preferences. Therefore, firstly this article repositions the term UDTs by comparing existing concrete and located applications that have a focus on interaction and participation, including some that may be closer to the concept of UDT than is commonly assumed. Based on the components found separately in the different studied cases, it is possible to hypothesize about possible future, more advanced realizations of UDTs. This enables us to contrast their positive and negative societal impacts. While the development of new immersive interactive digital worlds can improve planning using collective knowledge for more inclusive and diverse cities, they pose significant risks not only the common ones regarding privacy, transparency, or fairness, but also social fragmentation based on urban digital multiplicities. The potential benefits and challenges of integrating this multiplicity of UDTs into participatory urban governance emphasize the need for human-centric approaches to promote socio-technical frameworks able to mitigate risks as social division.",

    "abstract": "The intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery, an indicator of subclinical atherosclerosis, varies in close association with various factors such as diabetes and immune response. The extent of changes in IMT varies among individuals owing to both genetic and epigenetic factors. In this study, we aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA methylation patterns that affect carotid IMT in monozygotic (MZ) twins.\nWe measured the maximum IMT (IMT-Cmax) and the mean IMT in the common carotid artery wall using ultrasonography in 107 pairs of MZ twins recruited from the Osaka University Twin Registry. The genotyping of SNPs and the measurement of methylation levels were performed using a beads array, and the expression of each gene was determined by RNA sequencing. Linear regression analysis was performed on each of the two groups: one group consisted of twins randomly selected from each pair, and the other group consisted of co-twins.\nWe identified a CpG site (cg02432467) on HS3ST6 as a significant epigenetic factor in both IMT-Cmax and mean IMT analyses. The methylation level at another site (cg07927379) was negatively correlated with LINC01006 expression and IMT-Cmax. Furthermore, there were significant differences in AP2A2 expression and mean IMT among individuals with each genotype of the rs10902263 polymorphism.\nWe identified genetic and epigenetic factors associated with carotid IMT that may be useful for individualized assessments.",

    "abstract": "Interest in the concept of a virtual human model that can encompass human physiology and anatomy on a biophysical (mechanistic) basis, and can assist with the clinical diagnosis and treatment of disease, appears to be growing rapidly around the globe. When such models are personalised and coupled with continual diagnostic measurements, they are called 'digital twins'. We argue here that the most useful form of virtual human model will be one that is constrained by the laws of physics, contains a comprehensive knowledge graph of all human physiology and anatomy, is multiscale in the sense of linking systems physiology down to protein function, and can to some extent be personalized and linked directly with clinical records. We discuss current progress from the IUPS Physiome Project and the requirements for a framework to achieve such a model.",

    "abstract": "Noonan syndrome (NS) is a rare, genetic multisystem disorder often presenting with associated craniofacial abnormalities. The authors report an identical twin pair with classical features of NS including short stature, mild ptosis, hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, low-set angulated ears, and giant cell tumors in the craniofacial skeleton. Interestingly, these patients also presented with bilateral, symmetric, dystrophic auricular calcifications. Genome sequencing revealed identical germline son of sevenless homolog 1 mutations and inversion of chromosome 2 (p11.2q13). Awareness of the association of auricular calcifications and NS may help guide clinical management for these patients, particularly if auricular procedures are indicated.",

    "abstract": "Parents of twins appear to be at increased risk of postpartum depression (PPD), yet little is known about the magnitude and timing of onset in the postpartum period compared to singleton parents.\nWe conducted a cohort study using the Danish nationwide health registers. We defined a study population of parents that is, mothers and fathers of all twin and singleton livebirths between 1997 and 2019. Postpartum depression was defined as incident depression diagnosis or a redeemed antidepressant prescription from childbirth through 365\u2009days postpartum. We performed a parametric time-to-event analysis based on Poisson regression. The time scale was time since birth, modeled using restricted cubic splines. From this we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) representing the momentary risk, and the cumulative risk ratio (RR) over the first year postpartum, in twin compared to singleton parents.\nThe study population was based on 27,095 twin and 1,350,046 singleton births. In adjusted analyses, the HR of twins compared to singletons was highest around 2\u2009months postpartum (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.10-1.49) for mothers, and around 6\u2009months (1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.42) for fathers. The 6\u2009months adjusted cumulative RR of PPD in twins compared to singletons was 1.24 (95% CI 1.10-1.40) for mothers and 1.11 (95% CI 0.95-1.30) for fathers.\nTwin mothers had increased risk of PPD compared to singleton mothers, which was driven by an immediate increase after childbirth. The risk among twin fathers was not increased immediately after childbirth, but we found slightly elevated risk around 6\u2009months postpartum. This could suggest diverse patterns of PPD symptomatology in twin parents compared to singleton parents and between mothers and fathers. Our findings underline parents of twins as a potentially vulnerable group to PPD and emphasize the need for increased awareness of their mental health.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) are personalized virtual representations used to understand complex cardiac mechanisms. A critical component of CDT development is solving the ECG inverse problem, which enables the reconstruction of cardiac sources and the estimation of patient-specific electrophysiology (EP) parameters from surface ECG data. Despite challenges from complex cardiac anatomy, noisy ECG data, and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, recent advances in computational methods have greatly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ECG inverse inference, strengthening the fidelity of CDTs. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the methods for solving ECG inverse problems, their validation strategies, their clinical applications, and their future perspectives. For the methodologies, we broadly classify state-of-the-art approaches into two categories: deterministic and probabilistic methods, including both conventional and deep learning-based techniques. Integrating physics laws with deep learning models holds promise, but challenges such as capturing dynamic electrophysiology accurately, accessing accurate domain knowledge, and quantifying prediction uncertainty persist. Integrating models into clinical workflows while ensuring interpretability and usability for healthcare professionals is essential. Overcoming these challenges will drive further research in CDTs.",

    "abstract": "The network theory posits that depression emerges as the result of individual symptoms triggering each other. Risk factors for depression can impact these between-symptoms interactions through extended networks. The study aimed to model the extended network of depressive symptoms and known depression risk factors - objective cognitive function, intellectual, physical, and social daily activities, and then, compare the observed networks between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) co-twins.\nTwin pairs, 722 MZ and 2200 DZ, aged 40-79, were selected from the Dansh Twin Registry for having complete measures of depressive symptoms (e.g., sadness), cognitive functions (e.g., verbal memory), physical (e.g., brisk walk), intellectual (e.g., reading newspapers) and social activities (e.g., phone calls). Gaussian graphical models were used to estimate and compare the networks first between co-twins and then, between MZ to DZ twin pairs separately.\nSpecific intellectual, physical and social activities were central in the extended networks of depressive symptoms and, with the exception of processing speed, more central than cognition. The extended networks' structure was more homogeneous between MZ co-twins relative to DZ co-twins. Cognitive nodes were more central in MZ than DZ co-twins.\nCross-sectional design, participants were middle-aged or older, mostly affective (non-somatic) depressive symptoms.\nIn depression networks, core connecting elements were intellectual, physical and social activities. The interaction between cognition and daily activities seems critical for triggering depressive symptoms. Thus, clinical interventions aimed at preventing depression and associated cognitive deficits should focus on maintenance and/or engagement in stimulating daily activities.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the application and effectiveness of prenatal ultrasound in diagnosing and managing conjoined twins.\nA retrospective analysis was conducted on 20 cases of conjoined twins diagnosed at our hospital between January 2016 and December 2022. The types of conjoined twins, ultrasonographic characteristics, and associated anomalies were assessed.\nThe gestational age at diagnosis ranged from 10 to 35\u2009weeks, with an average of 14.21\u2009\u00b1\u20095.69\u2009weeks. Thirteen cases were detected in the first trimester, five in the early second trimester, one at 23\u2009+\u20092\u2009weeks, and one at 35\u2009weeks. Thoracopagus was the most common type (11 cases, 55%), followed by omphalopagus (4 cases, 20%), cephalopagus (4 cases, 20%), and parapagus dicephalus (1 case, 5%). In the first trimester, the most common abnormalities observed included increased nuchal translucency (NT), cystic hygroma, hydrops fetalis, and generalized edema. Major birth defects identified in conjoined twins were omphalocele (3 cases), congenital heart malformations (3 cases), neural tube defects (2 cases), urachal cyst (1 case), and umbilical cyst (1 case). Pregnancy was terminated in 18 cases, one case resulted in spontaneous abortion during the second trimester, and one case was delivered by cesarean section at 37\u2009weeks, with successful separation and recovery.\nPrenatal ultrasound is the primary diagnostic tool for conjoined twins. It effectively assesses the extent of twin fusion, provides critical information for clinical decision-making, and aids in the management of obstetric care.",

    "abstract": "Authoritarianism and populism are used regularly to describe the individuals responsible for anti-democratic action. These two constructs share some similarities with regard to how they hinder democracy and at times have been used interchangeably to describe such issues. However, authoritarians and populists may differ with regard to their political identification, as well as how they view the government and the existing establishment.\nWith a US college sample, this study's goal was to examine how authoritarianism and populist attitudes influence views on pluralism, elitism, trust in government, identity fusion, and political identification (identification with American political parties).\nThe findings indicated that right-wing authoritarians trusted the government, endorsed elitist attitudes, but were low on pluralism; this pattern was the opposite for those high on populist attitudes. Left-wing authoritarianism was related only to low pluralism. Moreover, low trust in the government partially mediated the link between populist attitudes and pluralism. Results also indicated that right-wing and left-wing authoritarians identified with the Republican and Democratic parties, respectively, whereas political identification was unrelated to populist attitudes. Furthermore, identity fusion partially mediated the link between right-wing authoritarianism and identification with the Republican Party.\nAuthoritarianism and populist attitudes may explain different motivations for anti-democratic thought and behaviors. This study contributes to ongoing debates found in contemporary populism and authoritarianism research as well as different solutions to addressing their rise in mainstream politics.",

Furthermore, identity fusion partially mediated the link between right-wing authoritarianism and identification with the Republican Party.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies, in the background of lack of twin registry in India, are a challenge. We report the response rates in tracing a hospital birth register-based cohort of twins using mail and door to door survey, ocular parameters influencing refractive errors, and their heritability.\nTwins born from 1991 to 1995 in a tertiary hospital in the Vellore District of South India from a database were traced by mail and home survey from March 2011 to September 2013. Consenting live twin pairs who presented to the eye department were examined, including best corrected visual acuity, cycloplegic refraction, slit lamp examination, measurements of intraocular pressure (IOP) by Goldmann Applanation tonometry, axial length (AL) and anterior chamber depth (ACD), central corneal thickness (CCT), specular microscopy for endothelial count (EC), and a dilated fundus examination. Zygosity was determined by a validated zygosity questionnaire. Heritability was determined using the Falconers formula.\nPostal contact was made in 14%, and a home visit was successful in another 23% of the cohort. Of those presenting for examination, 51.3% were found to be monozygous. Heritability (h 2 ) of IOP was 0.34, that of ACD was 0.88, that of AL was 0.92, that of CCT was 0.96, and that of EC was 0.58.\nTracing of twins using postal and home visits is challenging. Heritability for AL and CCT was found to be high, similar to that reported in other studies. This implies that a large proportion of variation found in AL and CCT is due to genetic causes as seen in twins from South India.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins have become a popular and widely used tool for assessing risk and resilience, particularly as they have increased in the fidelity and accuracy of their representation of real-world systems. Although digital twins provide the ability to experiment on and assess risks to and from a system without damaging the real-world system, they pose potentially significant security risks. For example, if a digital twin of a power system has sufficient accuracy to allow loss of electrical power service due to a natural hazard to be estimated at the address level with a high degree of accuracy, what prevents someone wishing to lead to disruption at this same building from using the model to solve the inverse problem to determine which parts of the power system should be attacked to maximize the likelihood of loss of service to the target facility? This perspective article discusses the benefits and risks of digital twins and argues that more attention needs to be paid to the risks posed by digital twins.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of highly adaptable and reusable artificial intelligence models facilitates the implementation of digital twinning and has the potential to redefine cardiovascular risk prevention. Digital twinning combines vast amounts of data from diverse sources to construct virtual models of an individual. Emerging artificial intelligence models, called generalist AI, enable the processing of different types of data, including data from electronic health records, laboratory results, medical texts, imaging, genomics, or graphs. Among their unprecedented capabilities are an easy adaptation of a model to previously unseen medical tasks and the ability to reason and explain output using precise medical language derived from scientific literature, medical guidelines, or knowledge graphs. The proposed combination of a digital twinning approach with generalist AI is a path to accelerate the implementation of precision medicine and enhance early recognition and prevention of cardiovascular disease. This proposed strategy may extend to other domains to advance predictive, preventive, and precision medicine and also boost health research discoveries.",

    "abstract": "The potential impact of large-scale combat operations and multidomain operations against peer adversaries poses significant challenges to the Military Health System including large volumes of critically ill and injured casualties, prolonged care times in austere care contexts, limited movement, contested logistics, and denied communications. These challenges contribute to the probability of higher casualty mortality and risk that casualty care hinders commanders' forward momentum or opportunities for overmatch on the battlefield. Novel technical solutions and associated concepts of operation that fundamentally change the delivery of casualty care are necessary to achieve desired medical outcomes that include maximizing Warfighter battle-readiness, minimizing return-to-duty time, optimizing medical evacuation that clears casualties from the battlefield while minimizing casualty morbidity and mortality, and minimizing resource consumption across the care continuum. These novel solutions promise to \"automate\" certain aspects of casualty care at the level of the individual caregiver and the system level, to unburden our limited number of providers to do more and make better (data-driven) decisions. In this commentary, we describe concepts of casualty digital twins-virtual representations of a casualty's physical journey through the roles of care-and how they, combined with passive data collection about casualty status, caregiver actions, and real-time resource use, can lead to human-machine teaming and increasing automation of casualty care across the care continuum while maintaining or improving outcomes. Our path to combat casualty care automation starts with mapping and modeling the context of casualty care in realistic environments through passive data collection of large amounts of unstructured data to inform machine learning models. These context-aware models will be matched with patient physiology models to create casualty digital twins that better predict casualty needs and resources required and ultimately inform and accelerate decision-making across the continuum of care. We will draw from the experience of the automotive industry as an exemplar for achieving automation in health care and inculcate automation as a mechanism for optimizing the casualty care survival chain.",

    "abstract": "Congenital loss involves the loss of an immediate family member, specifically a parent or sibling, either during or prior to birth, and bears unique bereavement-related challenges. The current study investigated the unique congenital loss experiences of those who lost a twin sibling in utero. Through analysis of interviews with 18 Jewish Israeli participants who encountered this type of twin loss, a more comprehensive understanding of their experiences was attempted. The research employed a hybrid methodology, combining two qualitative thematic analysis methods: deductive and data-driven inductive approaches. The analysis revealed four themes: incoherency and uncertainty, ownership over a limited story, continuing an unborn bond, and the identity of a \"twin-less\" twin. The findings underscore the unique nature of twin loss in utero.",

Conjoined twins are monochorionic (one placenta) and monoamniotic (one amniotic sac). Conjoined twins exist in a female to male ratio of 3\u00a0to 1.
