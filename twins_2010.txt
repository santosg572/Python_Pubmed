    "abstract": "A difference more than 15-40% in birth weight of twins can predict perinatal complications. As significant difference in twins growth has a very important effect on pregnancy and perinatal complications, this study aimed to evaluate crown-rump length discordance (\u0394CRL) in the first trimester of pregnancy and its correlation with perinatal complications.\nA total number of 118 women in the first trimester of twin pregnancy underwent ultrasound examination to measure \u0394CRL. Then, at the time of delivery, perinatal complications in twins were recorded and the correlation between \u0394CRL and perinatal complications were evaluated.\nAmong 118 studied mothers with twin pregnancy, \u0394CRL was normal (< 11%) in 96 cases (81.4%) and high (\u2265 11%) in 22 cases (18.6%). Birth weight discordance was normal (< 20%) in 103 cases (87.3%) and above normal (\u2265 20%) in 15 cases (12.7%). The results revealed a significant correlation between higher frequency of small for gestational age (SGA) and high \u0394CRL (more than 11%) (p = 0.01).\nOur study concluded that SGA has a significant relationship with high \u0394CRL (> 11%).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this case study was to describe pain responses in three study conditions: longer (30 minutes) kangaroo care (KC) before and throughout heel stick (KC30), shorter (15 minutes) KC before and throughout heel stick (KC15), and incubator care throughout heel stick (IC) in 28-week gestational age twins. Pain responses were measured by crying time, Preterm Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), and heart rate variability indexes, including low-frequency power (LF, representing sympathetic activity), high-frequency power (HF, parasympathetic activity), and LF/HF ratio (sympathetic-parasympathetic balance). Both twins cried more and had higher PIPP pain scores and tachycardia during heel stick in the IC condition. Infant B had an incident of apnea and tachycardia by the end of the heel stick and a bradycardia episode during recovery in the IC condition. The twins had lower LF/HF ratios (better autonomic nervous system balance) during recovery in both longer and shorter KC conditions compared with the IC condition. Infant B had difficulty returning to LF/HF ratio baseline level after the painful procedure in the IC condition. These data suggest that both longer and shorter KC before and throughout painful procedures can be helpful in reducing behavioral and physiologic pain responses in preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "To compare the fetal loss rate of monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies according to their amnionicity.\nA retrospective review of all MC pregnancy outcomes in a tertiary centre. Pregnancy outcomes were compared for monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA) versus monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) pregnancies.\n29 MCMA and 117 MCDA twin pregnancies were identified. The overall fetal loss rate was significantly higher in MCMA (23/52, 44.2%) compared to MCDA pregnancies (28/233, 12%, Chi squared = 30.03, p < .001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that fetal survival rate in MCDA twins were significantly higher than in MCMA twins (Log-rank Chi-squared = 27.9, p < .0005). Early pregnancy ultrasound identified the causes for these fetal losses in some MCMA twins. After exclusion of identifiable causes, the difference in fetal survival was not significant in the two groups (Log-rank chi-squared = 0.373, p = .54).\nThe loss rate for MCMA twins is high and occurs mainly due to discordant congenital abnormality, conjoint twins or twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence. Although the fetal loss rate in MCDA is lower than in MCMA pregnancies, the majority of fetal loss in MCDA pregnancies cannot be predicted at the first scan at presentation.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to: (1) determine concordance rates of self-reported and subjectively determined indicators of oral malodor in twins; (2) determine the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to levels of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in intraoral and exhaled breath. Fifty-one twin pairs participated in the study. Measurements of VSCs were obtained by a halimeter. The presence of tongue coatings was determined and twins filled out a 32-item questionnaire on oral malodor indicators independently of one another. Estimates of heritability (h2) for halimeter measurements were computed by SOLAR. The concordance rates for the presence of tongue coating among identical and fraternal twins were 67% and 11%, respectively. In the 10 most informative items, 70% exhibited higher concordance rates for identical than for fraternal twins. Of particular interest were the differences in concordance rates for dry mouth, sinus infection and unusual sweating. The h2 for intraoral breath was 0.28 +/- 0.17 (NS), whereas the h2 for exhaled breath was 0.50 +/- 0.20 (p = .0207). The concordance rates of tongue coatings and malodor indicators were higher in identical twins than in fraternal twins. Intraoral breath VSC values were primarily attributable to environmental factors, whereas exhaled breath VSC values were partially explained by genetic factors.",

A total of 42 pairs of twins (monozygotic twins-16 pairs, dizygotic like sex twins-20 pairs and dizygotic unlike sex twins-6 pairs) from the states of West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh of India were studied for this purpose. High discordance value in dizygotic twins in various types of bracelet creases is found to be sufficient to account for the high estimates of heritability. Estimated value of heritability (0.80), however, corroborates this finding. This is indicative of major role played by genetic factors in the expression of the trait as compared to environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins are considered to be genetically identical, yet can show high discordance in their phenotypes and disease susceptibility. Several studies have emphasized the influence of external factors and the role of epigenetic polymorphism in conferring this variability. However, some recent high-resolution studies on DNA methylation show contradicting evidence, which poses questions on the extent of epigenetic variability between twins. The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies now allow us to interrogate multiple epigenomes on a massive scale and understand the role of epigenetic modification, especially DNA methylation, in regulating complex traits. This article briefly discusses the recent key findings, unsolved questions in the area, and speculates on the future directions in the field.",

    "abstract": "We examined the risk of atopic diseases in twins born after assisted reproduction. Data on atopic diseases and assisted reproduction in 9694 twin pairs, 3-20 years of age, from the Danish Twin Registry were collected via multidisciplinary questionnaires. The risk of atopic diseases in twins born after assisted reproduction was compared with the risk in twins born after spontaneous conception using logistic regression and variance components analysis. Children born after assisted reproduction did not have a different risk of atopic outcomes (adjusted odds ratios [95% confidence intervals] for asthma: 0.95 [0.85, 1.07], P = 0.403; hay fever: 1.01 [0.86, 1.18], P = 0.918; and atopic dermatitis: 1.02 [0.81, 1.11], P = 0.773 respectively) compared with children born after spontaneous conception. Assisted reproduction did not modify the heritability of atopic diseases. This study does not support an association between assisted reproduction and development of atopic diseases. This result must be confirmed in subsequent studies, preferably of singleton populations.",

    "abstract": "Theory and research suggest that maladaptive perfectionism, specifically, concerns about mistakes (CM) and doubts about actions (DA), may be important etiologic and maintenance mechanisms for anxiety and its disorders. However, no studies speaking directly to the origins of the relationship, i.e. what etiologic factors underlie the phenotypic association between anxiety and maladaptive perfectionism, exist. The current study aimed to address this gap in the literature by exploring genetic and environmental relationships between anxiety symptoms and maladaptive perfectionism.\nThe sample consisted of 292 young adult same-sex female twins from the Michigan State University Twin Registry. Anxiety symptoms were assessed by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait version and an anxiety problems scale derived from the Young Adult Self Report. Maladaptive perfectionism was measured using the CM and DA subscales of the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale.\nAnxiety and maladaptive perfectionism were both moderately heritable, with estimates ranging from. 45 to .66. Moreover, multivariate analyses revealed that genetic factors were primarily responsible for associations between anxiety and maladaptive perfectionism (r(g) =.59-.88).\nThis is the first study to demonstrate the role of genetic factors in the relationship between anxiety and maladaptive perfectionism. Future studies are needed to uncover the specific biologic and genetic factors that contribute to this relationship and to evaluate whether maladaptive perfectionism represents an intermediate trait or risk factor for anxiety.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify the anatomic and pathologic structural cardiac abnormalities in conjoined twins and to focus on those that have prevented the successful separation of conjoined hearts. A retrospective review was undertaken to examine consecutive cases of thoracopagus conjoined twins with conjoined hearts evaluated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from 1 January 1980 through 6 October 2008. The records included autopsy and surgical findings as well as clinical reports. The study group included nine sets of conjoined twins with a mean gestational age at birth of 33.8 \u00b1 5.5 weeks. Three twin pairs were stillborn. Five twin pairs died afterward. One pair died of cardiopulmonary failure. The median age at death was 22 days (range, 0-345 days). Major congenital heart disease was present in 94.4% (17/18) of the hearts, and 72.2% (13/18) of the hearts had single-ventricle physiology. Total anomalous pulmonary venous return occurred in 39% (7/18) of the cases. The clinical outcome for thoracopagus twins with conjoined hearts remains poor because of inability to separate conjoined and single ventricles. Surgical nonintervention and palliative care should be strongly considered for these patients.",

    "abstract": "It is the common lore to assume that knowing the equation for the probability distribution function (PDF) of a stochastic model as a function of time tells the whole picture defining all other characteristics of the model. We show that this is not the case by comparing two exactly solvable models of anomalous diffusion due to geometric constraints: the comb model and the random walk on a random walk. We show that though the two models have exactly the same PDFs, they differ in other respects, like their first passage time distributions, their autocorrelation functions, and their aging properties.",

    "abstract": "Variation in response styles in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are known to be predictors of short- and long-term health outcomes. The nature of HPA responses to stressors changes with developmental stage, and some components of the stress response exhibit long-term individual consistency (i.e., are trait-like) while others are transient or variable (i.e., state-like). Here we evaluated the response of marmoset monkeys (Callithrix geoffroyi) to a standardized social stressor (social separation and exposure to a novel environment) at three different stages of development: juvenile, subadult, and young adult. We monitored levels of urinary cortisol (CORT), and derived multiple measures of HPA activity: Baseline CORT, CORT reactivity, CORT Area Under the Curve (AUC), and CORT regulation. Juvenile marmosets exhibited the most dramatic stress response, had higher AUCs, and tended to show poorer regulation. While baseline CORT and CORT regulation were not consistent within an individual across age, CORT reactivity and measures of AUC were highly correlated across time; i.e., individuals with high stress reactivity and AUC as juveniles also had high measures as subadults and adults, and vice-versa. Marmoset co-twins did not exhibit similar patterns of stress reactivity. These data suggest that regardless of the source of variation in stress response styles in marmosets, individually-distinctive patterns are established by six months of age, and persist for at least a year throughout different phases of marmoset life history.",

    "abstract": "Extant twin research on the depression-smoking association in adolescents has been conducted in U.S. and European samples and considered depression as a unitary phenotype. This study explored genetic and environmental influences on covariation between smoking initiation and 4 depressive symptom dimensions (positive affect [PA], negative affect [NA], somatic features [SF], and interpersonal problems [IP]) in adolescent Chinese twins.\nQuestionnaires measuring current depressive symptoms and lifetime smoking initiation were administered to 602 twin pairs (M [SD] age = 12.2 (1.93) years, range 9-16 years). Cholesky bivariate decomposition models examined influences on each depressive symptom dimension, smoking initiation, and their covariation using age- and sex-adjusted threshold variables.\nWithin-twin correlations between smoking initiation and each depressive symptom dimension were significant (|r|s = .29-.61). Bivariate twin modeling showed significant genetic effects on overall depressive symptoms (55% variance), shared environment effects on NA (36%) and PA (53%), and shared environment effects on smoking initiation (46%) unique from PA. No other familial influences on the individual phenotypes (apart from those accounting for smoking-depression covariance) were significant. Relations of smoking initiation to overall depressive symptoms and IP were influenced by familial (shared environment and/or genetic) factors and nonshared environmental factors. The SF-smoking initiation relation was influenced mostly by familial factors. Only shared environment significantly influenced the association of lower PA and higher NA to smoking initiation.\nRelations between each symptom dimension and smoking initiation are of sizeable magnitude in Chinese adolescents. Genetic and environmental factors underlying depression-smoking comorbidity may vary across different depressive symptom dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis and management of conjoined twins are constantly evolving. New imaging techniques provide important anatomic details and help in planning the separation procedure. Despite these technological advances, however, the complex arrangement of conjoined organs is somewhat difficult to interpret, leaving unresolved questions at time of surgery. The authors present a video demonstrating laparoscopy as an adjunct in the preoperative planning of separation of ischiopagus tripus conjoined twins as well as illustrating the complex anatomy in a combination of video, drawings, and radiologic imaging. To date, this is the first time that laparoscopy has been used in preoperative assessment of conjoined twins.\nAfter elective cesarean delivery, ischiopagus tripus conjoined twins were thoroughly evaluated with conventional imaging, including plain radiographs and computed tomography scan with three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction images. The anatomy of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts was further defined with barium enema, retrograde pyelography, and cystoscopy. In addition to these tests, diagnostic laparoscopy was performed at time of tissue expander placement. An angled scope, introduced through a 5-mm umbilical port, was used to visualize the intraperitoneal organs as well as all accessible retroperitoneal structures.\nLaparoscopy provided useful information regarding the bowel distribution between the twins. In addition, it helped demonstrate the relationship of shared solid organs with other intra-abdominal structures and identify anatomic landmarks used in the subsequent separation of the twins. Finally, laparoscopy helped confirm the presence, number, and morphology of the internal female genitalia.\nDiagnostic laparoscopy is a useful tool in evaluation of ischiopagus tripus conjoined twins. It is an important adjunct to preoperative studies in preparing for an expeditious and safe separation procedure.",

    "abstract": "Although differences in size of the right and left thyroid lobes are well defined, differences in morphology, follicles structure, cAMP production, thyrotropin receptor, and protein involved in cell signalling have not previously been reported. This study provides morpho-functional data of right and left thyroid lobes by biochemical, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis. We demonstrate that, in comparison with the left lobe, the right lobe has a higher activation index, is more sensitive to thyrotropin treatment, is rich in thyrotropin receptor and caveolin 1 involved in thyroid hormone synthesis as well as in epithelial thyroid cell homeostasis, is characterised by a high content of molecules involved in cell signalling such as stat3, raf1, sphingomyelinase and sphingomyelin-synthase whose activity ratio is necessary for epithelial cell activity and finally has more areas calcitonin-dependent. The relation between structure/function of right lobe and its susceptibility to the higher risk of pathological modifications with respect the left lobe is discussed.",

Genetic risk of drug use based on family history, higher sensation seeking, and peer group deviance predicted both alcohol and cannabis initiation. Higher drug availability predicted cannabis initiation while less parental monitoring and drug availability were the best predictors of how much cannabis individuals consumed over time.\nThe liability to initiate alcohol and cannabis, average drug use as well as changes in drug use during teenage years and young adulthood is associated with known risk factors.",

    "abstract": "In a sample of 3,187 twins and 3,294 of their parents, we sought to investigate association of both individual variants and a genotype-based height score involving 176 of the 180 common genetic variants with adult height identified recently by the GIANT consortium. First, longitudinal observations on height spanning pre-adolescence through adulthood in the twin sample allowed us to investigate the separate effects of the previously identified SNPs on pre-pubertal height and pubertal growth spurt. We show that the effect of SNPs identified by the GIANT consortium is primarily on prepubertal height. Only one SNP, rs7759938 in LIN28B, approached a significant association with pubertal growth. Second, we show how using the twin data to control statistically for environmental variance can provide insight into the ultimate magnitude of SNP effects and consequently the genetic architecture of a phenotype. Specifically, we computed a genetic score by weighting SNPs according to their effects as assessed via meta-analysis. This weighted score accounted for 9.2% of the phenotypic variance in height, but 14.3% of the corresponding genetic variance. Longitudinal samples will be needed to understand the developmental context of common genetic variants identified through GWAS, while genetically informative designs will be helpful in accurately characterizing the extent to which these variants account for genetic, and not just phenotypic, variance.",

    "abstract": "Although the genetic risk to develop bipolar disorder is present from conception, the first frank symptoms of the illness generally become evident in late adolescence or early adulthood. However, except for pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD), it is still unclear when the first signs of the illness in adults become apparent and whether these are related to the genetic risk to develop bipolar disorder. This study examined whether underperformance at school precedes the onset of the illness and is a genetically related risk marker for developing bipolar disorder.\nInformation on school performance was obtained using objective archival data from 53 bipolar twin pairs (24 monozygotic (MZ), 29 dizygotic (DZ)) and 42 healthy matched control twin pairs (23 MZ, 19 DZ).\nAffected twin pairs completed significantly fewer years of education than did control twin pairs with no difference between bipolar patients and their non-bipolar cotwins. The underperformance at school in the affected twin pairs occurred in early adolescence at a significantly younger age than the control twin pairs and preceded the onset of the first frank episode of bipolar disorder by thirteen years. Median age at onset of underperformance was not different in the patients and their non-bipolar cotwins. The association between liability of bipolar disease and age of first underperformance was significant and could be explained by genetic factors.\nThe sample is not a population based twin sample.\nUnderperformance at school during early adolescence may be a genetic marker for the vulnerability to develop bipolar disorder.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between personality and life span is not well understood, and no study to date has examined genetic influences underlying this relationship. The present study aimed to explore the phenotypic and genetic relationship between personality and life span, as well as genetic influences on all-cause mortality.\nProspective community-based study including 3752 twin individuals older than 50 years. Neuroticism, psychoticism, extraversion, and social desirability and pessimism/optimism were measured at baseline using the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and the Revised Life Orientation Test, respectively. Information on age at death was obtained 16 years after the initial assessment of personality.\nExtraversion was inversely related to mortality with the risk of death decreasing 3% per unit increase of the extraversion score. Psychoticism and pessimism were positively related to mortality with a 36% and 39% increase in risk of death per unit increase in the respective personality score. Heritability of life span was 7%. Cross-twin cross-trait hazard ratios (HRs) were only significant for optimism/pessimism in monozygotic (MZ) twins with no significant differences in HRs between MZ and dizygotic twins in all traits; however, there was a trend for slightly higher HRs in MZ compared with dizygotic twins in psychoticism and optimism/pessimism.\nExtraversion, psychoticism, and optimism/pessimism are significant predictors of longevity; extraversion is associated with a reduction, and pessimism and psychoticism are associated with an increase in mortality risk. Genetic influences on longevity in Australian twins are very low (7%). Our data also suggest a small, albeit nonsignificant, genetic influence on the relationship of pessimism and psychoticism with life span.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated in early embryonic life. Females are therefore mosaics for two cell populations, one with the maternal and one with the paternal X as the active X chromosome. A skewed X inactivation is a marked deviation from a 50:50 ratio. In populations of women past 55-60 years of age, an increased degree of skewing (DS) is found. Here the association between age-related skewing and mortality is analyzed in a 13-year follow-up study of 500 women from three cohorts (73-100 years of age at intake). Women with low DS had significantly higher mortality than the majority of women who had a more skewed DS (hazard ratio: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.04-1.64). The association between X inactivation and mortality was replicated in dizygotic twin pairs for which the co-twin with the lowest DS also had a statistically significant tendency to die first in the twin pairs with the highest intra-pair differences in DS (proportion: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.52-0.86). Both results suggest that lower DS is associated with higher mortality. We therefore propose that age-related skewing may be partly due to a population selection with lower mortality among those with higher DS.",

    "abstract": "Congenital complete heart block associated with transplacental passage of maternal autoantibodies reactive with SSA/Ro and SSB/La is a rare disease with significant fetal, neonatal, and childhood morbidity and mortality. We present the case of dichorionic, diamniotic twins (female twin A and male twin B) exposed to maternal Ro and La autoantibodies with different disease expression. Twin A (female) had Mobitz type I second degree atrioventricular (AV) block (Wenckebach); twin B (male) had normal sinus rhythm. Both twins had structurally normal hearts but demonstrated echocardiographic evidence of endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE). Following maternal dexamethasone 4 mg once daily, twin A reverted to sinus rhythm in utero; twin B remained in sinus rhythm throughout pregnancy. Echocardiograms after delivery demonstrated resolution of EFE in both fetuses, and EKGs confirmed sinus rhythm. However, at five months of age, Holter monitor demonstrated first degree AV block and intermittent Wenckebach in twin A. Twin B remains in sinus rhythm. This case is one of only three in the literature that describes Mobitz type I second degree atrioventricular block presenting in fetuses exposed to maternal SSA and SSB autoantibodies and is the first case that we have seen reported in twins. Importantly, this case also adds to the growing body of literature describing EFE as a presentation of neonatal lupus with or without conduction system abnormalities, emphasizes the spectrum of cardiac conduction abnormalities in neonatal lupus syndrome, and raises interesting questions about discordant disease expression in twins.",

    "abstract": "Associations of height and head circumference with IQ are well documented, but much less is known about the association of IQ with other anthropometric measures or the mechanisms behind these associations. We therefore analyzed the associations between IQ and several anthropometric measures using a twin-study design. Twins born in Minnesota were assessed at either age 11 (756 complete pairs) or 17 (626 complete pairs) and analyzed using genetic modeling. Head circumference and height showed the most consistent positive associations with IQ, whereas more detailed anthropometric measures were not significantly better predictors of IQ. These associations were mainly due to common genetic factors. Our results suggest that the same genetic factors have an effect on physical and cognitive development. Head circumference and height capture information on children's physical development, which is partly associated also with cognitive development.",

Twin families were registered with the Netherlands Twin Register. We included 1534 dizygotic (DZ) twins born after IVF, 5315 naturally conceived (NC) DZ twins, and 1504 control NC DZ twins who were matched to the IVF twins based on maternal age, maternal educational level, smoking during pregnancy, gestational age, and offspring sex. Data were obtained by longitudinal surveys sent to fathers, mothers, and teachers at ages 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 12 years. Results showed no differences in growth, in attainment of motor milestones, and in behavioral development between IVF and matched NC twins. It can be concluded that for nearly all aspects, development in IVF and NC children is similar.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal atresia in both twins from the same pregnancy is very rare. Only seven pairs of twins have been described. The authors report on two cases of monozygotic twins with different types of intestinal atresia and clinical evolution. Both pairs of observed twins turned out to be concordant for the presence of intestinal malformations and for the absence of other linked malformations; nevertheless, the atresic lesions were anatomically discordant in each pair of monozygotic twins. Therefore, the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures have shown some differences in phenotypic expression between the twins of both pairs. Possible etiologic factors and pathogenetic pathways are discussed, and the importance of an accurate clinical and instrumental investigation and a long-term follow-up is underlined. Very rare models, such as pairs of monozygotic twins presenting intestinal atresia, represent an extraordinary resource to add new clinical and laboratory information likely to be useful in future advancements to understand the underlying etiology and pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this audit was to assess the accuracy of transabdominal ultrasound scan in predicting chorionicity in twin pregnancies in our unit. The presence or absence of lambda sign, T-sign, dividing membrane thickness and number of placentae were used to determine chorionicity. We retrospectively analysed these antenatal markers in 268 sets of twins delivered over a 5 year period and compared it with the postpartum placental histology and neonatal gender. Of 268 twin deliveries, 204 (76%) had both chorionicity and placental histology to compare. 67 of 84 (80%) were correctly diagnosed antenatally as monochorionic and 137 of 151 (91%) as dichorionic. In 31 cases (15%) the ultrasound diagnosis of chorionicity didn't match placental histology. Seventeen were thought to be monochorionic antenatally but were confirmed dichorionic on placental histology. Overall chorionicity was correctly diagnosed in 171/204 (84%) using transabdominal ultrasound scan (USS) in all trimesters. However the sensitivity and specificity of USS was much higher for dichorionic twins when carried out before 14 weeks of gestation.",

In addition to environmental factors and stochastic developmental events, a number of genetic mechanisms, detectable by new techniques in molecular genetics, explain the differences frequently observed in MZ twins.\nNine-year-old twin girls requested treatment for a dental malocclusion. Their facial and occlusal features were very similar. Panoramic radiographs revealed hypodontia of two permanent teeth in one twin (35 and 45) and of only one tooth in the other (45). An incorrect diagnosis of dizygosity (DZ) had been made at birth based on the presence of two amniotic sacs. Despite discordance in the dental complement of both girls their orthodontist suspected that the twins might be identical. A genetic study performed by quantitative fluorescence-polymerase chain reaction (QFPCR) analysis of chromosomes 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, and X confirmed that the twins were MZ.\nDiscordances in dental complement between MZ twins are not uncommon and do not exclude monozygosity.",

    "abstract": "Imprinting control regions are differentially methylated in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner and this methylation state is inherited through the germline. These regions control parent-specific monoallelic expression of their target genes. Genetically identical organisms show considerable variation in their epigenomes owing to environmental and stochastic influences creating fluctuations in phenotype. Monozygotic twin pairs discordant for imprinting disorders due to epigenetic changes at imprinting control regions are an example of phenotypic variation caused by extreme variations of the epigenome. Here, we discuss the within-pair epigenetic discordance at imprinted loci, both in phenotypically concordant and discordant monozygotic twin pairs.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide and related nitrogen species (reactive nitrogen species) now occupy a central position in contemporary medicine, physiology, biochemistry, and microbiology. In particular, NO plays important antimicrobial defenses in innate immunity but microbes have evolved intricate NO-sensing and defense mechanisms that are the subjects of a vast literature. Unfortunately, the burgeoning NO literature has not always been accompanied by an understanding of the intricacies and complexities of this radical and other reactive nitrogen species so that there exists confusion and vagueness about which one or more species exert the reported biological effects. The biological chemistry of NO and derived/related molecules is complex, due to multiple species that can be generated from NO in biological milieu and numerous possible reaction targets. Moreover, the fate and disposition of NO is always a function of its biological environment, which can vary significantly even within a single cell. In this review, we consider newer aspects of the literature but, most importantly, consider the underlying chemistry and draw attention to the distinctiveness of NO and its chemical cousins, nitrosonium (NO(+)), nitroxyl (NO(-), HNO), peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), nitrite (NO(2)(-)), and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)). All these species are reported to be generated in biological systems from initial formation of NO (from nitrite, NO synthases, or other sources) or its provision in biological experiments (typically from NO gas, S-nitrosothiols, or NO donor compounds). The major targets of NO and nitrosative damage (metal centers, thiols, and others) are reviewed and emphasis is given to newer \"-omic\" methods of unraveling the complex repercussions of NO and nitrogen oxide assaults. Microbial defense mechanisms, many of which are critical for pathogenicity, include the activities of hemoglobins that enzymically detoxify NO (to nitrate) and NO reductases and repair mechanisms (e.g., those that reverse S-nitrosothiol formation). Microbial resistance to these stresses is generally inducible and many diverse transcriptional regulators are involved-some that are secondary sensors (such as Fnr) and those that are \"dedicated\" (such as NorR, NsrR, NssR) in that their physiological function appears to be detecting primarily NO and then regulating expression of genes that encode enzymes with NO as a substrate. Although generally harmful, evidence is accumulating that NO may have beneficial effects, as in the case of the squid-Vibrio light-organ symbiosis, where NO serves as a signal, antioxidant, and specificity determinant. Progress in this area will require a thorough understanding not only of the biology but also of the underlying chemical principles.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation may play an essential role in the decline of physical performance. In this study we investigated the associations between inflammatory markers, candidate polymorphisms and physical performance in elderly people. Plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen, sICAM-1 and candidate polymorphisms were measured in 600 twin individuals aged 73 years and older participating in the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins. Physical performance was assessed using a self-reported measure. The inclusion of twins allowed both traditional and within-twin-pair analysis which permitted control for shared environment and genetic factors. Higher levels of inflammatory markers were generally associated with a lower level of physical performance. The TNF\u03b1-238G/A polymorphism was significantly associated with physical performance in men, with A allele carriers having significantly better performance than GG homozygotes. However, this gene variation seems to have only a minor role in explaining the associations between the levels of inflammatory markers and physical performance. When using twin pair analysis to test whether genetic factors in general account for this association, results showed that the association between the level of fibrinogen and physical performance could be caused by genetic factors. Also the association between the level of TNF-\u03b1 and physical performance in males could be caused by genetic factors. However, other gene variations than the candidate gene polymorphisms studied here seem to explain the major part of the genetic proportion of this association.",

    "abstract": "Several case reports have linked solvent exposure to Parkinson disease (PD), but few studies have assessed associations with specific agents using an analytic epidemiologic design. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to specific solvents is associated with PD risk using a discordant twin pair design.\nNinety-nine twin pairs discordant for PD ascertained from the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council World War II Veteran Twins Cohort were interviewed regarding lifetime occupations and hobbies using detailed job task-specific questionnaires. Exposures to 6 specific solvents selected a priori were estimated by expert raters unaware of case status.\nEver exposure to trichloroethylene (TCE) was associated with significantly increased risk of PD (odds ratio [OR], 6.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-33; p = 0.034), and exposure to perchloroethylene (PERC) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4) ) tended toward significance (respectively: OR, 10.5; 95% CI, 0.97-113; p = 0.053; OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 0.9-6.1; p = 0.088). Results were similar for estimates of exposure duration and cumulative lifetime exposure.\nExposure to specific solvents may increase risk of PD. TCE is the most common organic contaminant in groundwater, and PERC and CCl(4) are also ubiquitous in the environment. Our findings require replication in other populations with well-characterized exposures, but the potential public health implications are substantial.",

The severity of asthma symptoms was graded according to a clinical interview, and markers of airway impairment and allergy were measured.\nAfter adjusting for confounders, genetic factors explained 24% (10%-37%), P = 0.0004, of the variation in overall asthma symptom severity, whereas non-shared environment accounted for the remaining 76% of the variation. A significant genetic component was also found for the severity of specific asthma symptoms; wheezing 12% (3%-22%), P = 0.007 and shortness of breath 17% (7%-27%), P = 0.0006, but not for chest tightness and cough. Asthma symptom severity correlated weakly with rhinitis severity as well as with objective markers of lung function, airway inflammation, airway responsiveness and allergic sensitization.\nThe individual variation in asthma symptom severity is to some degree influenced by genetic factors, but environmental factors explain the main part of the variation. The genetic architectures underlying the severity of asthma symptoms and objectively measured asthma-related traits, respectively, seem to differ.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of phenotypic differences between monozygotic (MZ) twins is commonly attributed to environmental factors, assuming that MZ twins have a complete identical genetic make-up. Yet, recently several lines of evidence showed that both genetic and epigenetic factors could have a role in phenotypic discordance after all. A high occurrence of copy number variation (CNV) differences was observed within MZ twin pairs discordant for Parkinson's disease, thereby stressing on the importance of post-zygotic mutations as disease-predisposing events. In this study, the prevalence of discrepant CNVs was analyzed in discordant MZ twins of the Esophageal Atresia (EA) and Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) cohort in the Netherlands. Blood-derived DNA from 11 pairs (7 EA and 4 CDH) was screened using high-resolution SNP arrays. Results showed an identical copy number profile in each twin pair. Mosaic chromosome gain or losses could not be detected either with a detection threshold of 20%. Some of the germ-line structural events demonstrated in five out of eleven twin pairs could function as a susceptible genetic background. For example, the 177-Kb loss of chromosome 10q26 in CDH pair-3 harbors the TCF7L2 gene (Tcf4 protein), which is implicated in the regulation of muscle fiber type development and maturation. In conclusion, discrepant CNVs are not a common cause of twin discordancy in these investigated congenital anomaly cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins have been observed in a wide range of mammalian and non-mammalian species; they are considered to be more common in bovine, less frequent in sheep and pig and extremely rare in horse and goat. A pair of female conjoined twins was delivered from a 2-year-old Chamois-coloured domestic goat. Post-mortem examination revealed two identical and symmetrical twins, fused from the manubrium sterni to the region just caudal to the umbilicus. The rib cages were conjoined in the ventral plane with a single set of pericardial, pleural and peritoneal cavities. Internal examination revealed the presence of a common diaphragm and a single enlarged liver. Within a single central pericardium, two malformed hearts were present. Reports on this type of congenital duplication in goats have not been found in the literature. Thoracopagus and thoraco-omphalopagus are the most common types of conjoined twins in human beings and are associated with the highest mortality because of the frequent incidence of complex cardiac anatomy.",

    "abstract": "This case report involved male infants of a size consistent with the estimated gestational age of 31 weeks. The mother of the twins was a 27-year-old, G4P3 woman with limited prenatal care who presented for cesarean delivery. Resuscitation efforts were initiated and continued until the infants became asystolic. Postmortem radiographs showed innumerable fractures of the limbs, ribs, and skull in various states of healing with callus formation; hence, the fractures were of prenatal origin. Despite the fractures, the growth of the long bones was not impaired. The radiographic findings were initially thought to represent osteogenesis imperfecta type IIC. However, there were also vascular anomalies not explained by this phenotype. Grossly, all arteries were elongated, thickened, and tortuous. The carotids, descending aorta, and iliac arteries were redundant to such an extent that they produced corkscrew patterns. There was also cutis laxa with loose, redundant skin over the entire body. Collagen genes did not show any mutations; however, when it was suggested Fibulin-4 be studied because of overlap with the condition described by Dasouki and colleagues in 2007, a homozygous premature stop codon mutation was found in that gene.",

    "abstract": "Identical twins account for 0.2% of the world population and 8% of all twins. A \"mirror image\" variation can be found in 25% of identical twins. Studies of twins assume a special place in human genetics due to the possibility of comparing genetic and other factors. We present two pairs of identical male twins with mirror-image astigmatism and esotropia.\nThe first was a pair of twelve-year old identical twins with \"mirror image\" myopic astigmatism. The Twin 1 had myopic astigmatism in the right eye, while the Twin 2 was affected by the left eye myopic astigmatism. The second was a pair of six-year old identical twins with esotropia and hypermetropic astigmatism. The Twin 1 had esotropia in the left eye, while the right eye was affected in the Twin 2. Esotropia was surgically corrected.\nIn this study we pointed to the role of genetic factors in the development of refractive error, as well as the type of strabismus. Refraction anomalies (myopia, hypermetropia and astigmatism) are complex heterogeneous disorders and ideal for genetic investigation. The knowledge of genetic mechanisms involved in refractive error susceptibility may allow treatment to prevent progression or to further examine gene-environment interactions. We hope that this paper will initiate further investigation of refraction anomalies in twins and future multicentre studies, which, to our knowledge, have not been conducted in our country so far.",

    "conclusions": "In this study we pointed to the role of genetic factors in the development of refractive error, as well as the type of strabismus. Refraction anomalies (myopia, hypermetropia and astigmatism) are complex heterogeneous disorders and ideal for genetic investigation. The knowledge of genetic mechanisms involved in refractive error susceptibility may allow treatment to prevent progression or to further examine gene-environment interactions. We hope that this paper will initiate further investigation of refraction anomalies in twins and future multicentre studies, which, to our knowledge, have not been conducted in our country so far.",

In both cases, prolonged action of succinylcholine caused by a butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) deficiency was confirmed by means of the dibucaine number test. In both cases, genetic analysis using the polymerase chain reaction revealed haplotype combined A and K variant mutations of the BCHE gene, both in the heterozygous form. These data show the potential risk of BCHE deficiency as a complication of anesthesia during ECT, and in particular underline the possible genetic contribution within a complex pathogenetic model.",

    "abstract": "Genetic studies in adults indicate that genes influencing the personality trait of neuroticism account for substantial genetic variance in anxiety and depression and in somatic health. Here, we examine for the first time the factors underlying the relationship between neuroticism and anxiety/depressive and somatic symptoms during adolescence.\nThe Somatic and Psychological Health Report (SPHERE) assessed symptoms of anxiety/depression (PSYCH-14) and somatic distress (SOMA-10) in 2459 adolescent and young adult twins [1168 complete pairs (35.4% monozygotic, 53% female)] aged 12-25 years (mean=15.5 \u00b1 2.9). Differences between boys and girls across adolescence were explored for neuroticism, SPHERE-34, and the subscales PSYCH-14 and SOMA-10. Trivariate analyses partitioned sources of covariance in neuroticism, PSYCH-14 and SOMA-10.\nGirls scored higher than boys on both neuroticism and SPHERE, with SPHERE scores for girls increasing slightly over time, whereas scores for boys decreased or were unchanged. Neuroticism and SPHERE scores were strongly influenced by genetic factors [heritability (h(2)) = 40-52%]. A common genetic source influenced neuroticism, PSYCH-14 and SOMA-10 (impacting PSYCH-14 more than SOMA-10). A further genetic source, independent of neuroticism, accounted for covariation specific to PSYCH-14 and SOMA-10. Environmental influences were largely specific to each measure.\nIn adolescence, genetic risk factors indexed by neuroticism contribute substantially to anxiety/depression and, to a lesser extent, perceived somatic health. Additional genetic covariation between anxiety/depressive and somatic symptoms, independent of neuroticism, had greatest influence on somatic distress, where it was equal in influence to the factor shared with neuroticism.",

    "abstract": "Although systemic autoimmune diseases (SAID) share many clinical and laboratory features, whether they also share some common features of pathogenesis remains unclear. We assessed plasma proteomic profiles among different SAID for evidence of common molecular pathways that could provide insights into pathogenic mechanisms shared by these diseases.\nDifferential quantitative proteomic analyses (one-dimensional reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) were performed to assess patterns of plasma protein expression. Monozygotic twins (four pairs discordant for systemic lupus erythematosus, four pairs discordant for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and two pairs discordant for juvenile dermatomyositis) were studied to minimize polymorphic gene effects. Comparisons were also made to 10 unrelated, matched controls.\nMultiple plasma proteins, including acute phase reactants, structural proteins, immune response proteins, coagulation and transcriptional factors, were differentially expressed similarly among the different SAID studied. Multivariate Random Forest modeling identified seven proteins whose combined altered expression levels effectively segregated affected vs. unaffected twins. Among these seven proteins, four were also identified in univariate analyses of proteomic data (syntaxin 17, \u03b1-glucosidase, paraoxonase 1, and the sixth component of complement). Molecular pathway modeling indicated that these factors may be integrated through interactions with a candidate plasma biomarker, PON1 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6.\nTogether, these data suggest that different SAID may share common alterations of plasma protein expression and molecular pathways. An understanding of the mechanisms leading to the altered plasma proteomes common among these SAID may provide useful insights into their pathogeneses.",

    "results": "Multiple plasma proteins, including acute phase reactants, structural proteins, immune response proteins, coagulation and transcriptional factors, were differentially expressed similarly among the different SAID studied. Multivariate Random Forest modeling identified seven proteins whose combined altered expression levels effectively segregated affected vs. unaffected twins. Among these seven proteins, four were also identified in univariate analyses of proteomic data (syntaxin 17, \u03b1-glucosidase, paraoxonase 1, and the sixth component of complement). Molecular pathway modeling indicated that these factors may be integrated through interactions with a candidate plasma biomarker, PON1 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the human gut microbiota and host are affected by probiotic bacterial strains requires carefully controlled studies in humans and in mouse models of the gut ecosystem where potentially confounding variables that are difficult to control in humans can be constrained. Therefore, we characterized the fecal microbiomes and metatranscriptomes of adult female monozygotic twin pairs through repeated sampling 4 weeks before, 7 weeks during, and 4 weeks after consumption of a commercially available fermented milk product (FMP) containing a consortium of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, two strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus thermophilus. In addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring a 15-species model human gut microbiota whose genomes contain 58,399 known or predicted protein-coding genes were studied before and after gavage with all five sequenced FMP strains. No significant changes in bacterial species composition or in the proportional representation of genes encoding known enzymes were observed in the feces of humans consuming the FMP. Only minimal changes in microbiota configuration were noted in mice after single or repeated gavage with the FMP consortium. However, RNA-Seq analysis of fecal samples and follow-up mass spectrometry of urinary metabolites disclosed that introducing the FMP strains into mice results in significant changes in expression of microbiome-encoded enzymes involved in numerous metabolic pathways, most prominently those related to carbohydrate metabolism. B. animalis subsp. lactis, the dominant persistent member of the FMP consortium in gnotobiotic mice, up-regulates a locus in vivo that is involved in the catabolism of xylooligosaccharides, a class of glycans widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other foods, underscoring the importance of these sugars to this bacterial species. The human fecal metatranscriptome exhibited significant changes, confined to the period of FMP consumption, that mirror changes in gnotobiotic mice, including those related to plant polysaccharide metabolism. These experiments illustrate a translational research pipeline for characterizing the effects of FMPs on the human gut microbiome.",

    "abstract": "A 17-year-old girl presented with a rare case of parasitic rachipagus conjoined twins associated with spina bifida, diplomyelia, scoliosis, tethered cord syndrome, and ventricular septal defect. Physical examination found a well developed breast and an apophysis on the back of the patient, and neuroimaging demonstrated scoliosis, spina bifida from T8 to L5, butterfly-shaped vertebra of T6, abnormal bone behind T7, diplomyelia, and tethered cord. Successful surgical excision of the parasitic mass was performed. Histological examination discovered uterine tube, Muller's duct, bone, cartilage, and nerve tissue besides the mammary gland. Rachipagus conjoined twins are extremely rare, but should be considered if well developed abnormal tissue is found in the dorsal midline of the spine. However, the possibility of malformations in other organs in the autosite should be considered. Careful preoperative examination and refined microsurgery may provide good outcome for the patient.",

    "abstract": "Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) shortens with age and is potentially a biomarker of human aging. We examined the relation of LTL with physical ability and cognitive function in 548 same-sex twins from the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins. LTL was measured by Southern blots of the terminal restriction fragments (TRF). Physical ability was evaluated using a self reported scale of 11 questions, while cognitive function was scored by MMSE and a cognitive composite score sensitive to age-related decline. A random intercept model revealed a positive, significant association between LTL and physical ability. For every unit increase in physical ability score, LTL increased by 0.066 kb (p = 0.01), equal to approximately three years of age-dependent LTL shortening. A matched case-co-twin design showed that the group consisting of the twins from each pair with the longer LTL also displayed better physical ability (p < 0.01). Moreover, the intra-pair difference in LTL was associated with intra-pair difference in physical ability (p < 0.01), confirming the association. However, we found no association between cognitive function and LTL. The LTL-physical ability association in the elderly provides further support to the premise that LTL is an index of somatic fitness in the narrow context of human physical health.",

    "abstract": "From an aircraft, a short distinct vertical structure is sometimes seen above the setting sun. Such a feature can be understood as a halo, which is the counterpart of the well-known subsun. Whereas the latter arises from reflections off basal faces of plate-oriented ice crystals illuminated from above, what we call the supersun emerges when these crystals are illuminated from below. The supersun occurs when the sun is below the true horizon and is only visible from elevated positions. The curvature of the Earth causes the ensemble of reflecting crystal faces to act as a hollow mirror and the supersun appears as a vertical band of uniform width, extending from the sun upwards to its supersolar point. We discuss the geometrical properties of the phenomenon and simulate its shape and radiance distribution with an extended version of an atmospheric ray-tracing program.",

    "abstract": "Transmission of excreted vaccine-derived infectious virus from vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals is possible within close contacts. This randomized (1:1), double-blind study evaluated the potential for transmission of human rotavirus vaccine strain, HRV (Rotarix\u2122) from vaccine recipients to unvaccinated close contacts (twins). 100 pairs of healthy twins aged 6-14 weeks at the time of Dose 1 of HRV vaccine/placebo were enrolled and one randomly selected twin from each pair received two vaccine doses and the other received placebo doses (at 2 and 4 months of age). Presence of vaccine strain in the stool samples of placebo recipients was an indicator of transmission. Serial stool samples were tested for rotavirus using ELISA at pre-determined time points; rotavirus positive stool samples were tested with RT-PCR and reverse hybridization assay to identify G1P[8] vaccine strain. If G1P[8] vaccine strain was detected, the complete genome was sequenced to assess the similarity between viral isolates. Immunogenicity and safety of HRV vaccine in transmission cases was assessed. 15 transmission cases were reported in 80 evaluable twins who received placebo and the transmission rate was 18.8% (95% CI: 10.9-29.0%). None of the transmission cases was associated with gastroenteritis symptoms. Anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion was 62.5% (95% CI: 51.0-73.1%) (HRV) and 21.3% (95% CI: 12.9-31.8%) (placebo) 7-weeks post-Dose 2; seroconversion in transmission cases was 26.7% (95% CI: 7.8-55.1%). Genetic variations or amino acid substitutions in transmission cases were similar to that seen in corresponding vaccine recipients. Transmission of HRV vaccine strain to unvaccinated twins living in close contact occurred, however, they were not associated with increased of gastroenteritis. Whether transmission leads to indirect protection among unvaccinated individuals remains unknown at this stage.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins (CT) are a very rare developmental accident of uncertain etiology. Prevalence has been previously estimated to be 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 births. The process by which monozygotic twins do not fully separate but form CT is not well understood. The purpose of the present study was to analyze diverse epidemiological aspects of CT, including the different variables listed in the Introduction Section of this issue of the Journal. The study was made possible using the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR) structure. This multicenter worldwide research includes the largest sample of CT ever studied. A total of 383 carefully reviewed sets of CT obtained from 26,138,837 births reported by 21 Clearinghouse Surveillance Programs (SP) were included in the analysis. Total prevalence was 1.47 per 100,000 births (95% CI: 1.32-1.62). Salient findings including an evident variation in prevalence among SPs: a marked variation in the type of pregnancy outcome, a similarity in the proportion of CT types among programs: a significant female predominance in CT: particularly of the thoracopagus type and a significant male predominance in parapagus and parasitic types: significant differences in prevalence by ethnicity and an apparent increasing prevalence trend in South American countries. No genetic, environmental or demographic significant associated factors were identified. Further work in epidemiology and molecular research is necessary to understand the etiology and pathogenesis involved in the development of this fascinating phenomenon of nature.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare congenital anomaly with an estimated incidence of 1/50,000 to 1/100,000. Among thoracopagus conjoined twins, 75% have a fused heart. We compare the usefulness of various modalities for evaluating cardiovascular structure in fused-heart conjoined twins. We report a series of 20 sets of thoracopagus conjoined twins as well as the results of a PubMed database literature review literature from 1982 to 2009. Twenty sets of fused-heart thoracopagus conjoined twins were evaluated by echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, magnetic resonance image (MRI), and three-dimensional computed tomography angiography (3D-CTA). Imaging results were compared to findings at surgery or autopsy. All sets of conjoined twins underwent postnatal echocardiography; 11 sets (55%) underwent cardiac catheterization; 4 sets (20%) underwent MRI; and 1 set (5%) underwent 3D-CTA. All intracardiac anatomy (ICA) was identified by echocardiography. Cardiac catheterization, MRI, and 3D-CTA were able to identify extracardiac vascular structures as well as the ICA. 3D-CTA, which can be performed as early as the first week of life, is a noninvasive, less expensive, and the safe examination with minimal risk due to its short procedural time. Three-dimensional CTA is an effective and safe modality for evaluating the cardiovascular anatomy of fused-heart conjoined twins before surgery.",

    "abstract": "One of the best studied read-outs of epigenetic change is the differential expression of imprinted genes, controlled by differential methylation of imprinted control regions (ICRs). To address the impact of genotype on the epigenome, we performed a detailed study in 128 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) and 128 pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins, interrogating the DNA methylation status of the ICRs of IGF2, H19, KCNQ1, GNAS and the non-imprinted gene RUNX1. While we found a similar overall pattern of methylation between MZ and DZ twins, we also observed a high degree of variability in individual CpG methylation levels, notably at the H19/IGF2 loci. A degree of methylation plasticity independent of the genome sequence was observed, with both local and regional CpG methylation changes, discordant between MZ and DZ individual pairs. However, concordant gains or losses of methylation, within individual twin pairs were more common in MZ than DZ twin pairs, indicating that de novo and/or maintenance methylation is influenced by the underlying DNA sequence. Specifically, for the first time we showed that the rs10732516 [A] polymorphism, located in a critical CTCF binding site in the H19 ICR locus, is strongly associated with increased hypermethylation of specific CpG sites in the maternal H19 allele. Together, our results highlight the impact of the genome on the epigenome and demonstrate that while DNA methylation states are tightly maintained between genetically identical and related individuals, there remains considerable epigenetic variation that may contribute to disease susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) account for a significant percentage of brain hemorrhages in pregnant patients. There is general consensus that ruptured AVMs in pregnant women should be managed based on neurosurgical rather than obstetric considerations. Since the risk of re-hemorrhage is significantly higher in the pregnant patient with a ruptured AVM, aggressive treatment during pregnancy must be considered if this can be accomplished with acceptable risk. Recent advances in endovascular technology have increased the potential for successful treatment of previously inoperable high-grade AVMs.\nA 17-year-old woman pregnant with twins experienced sudden onset headache and became unresponsive at 20 weeks gestation. A CT scan of the head showed cerebellar hemorrhage and obstructive hydrocephalus. Cerebral angiography showed a 5.5 cm AVM in the cerebellar vermis with deep drainage for a Spetzler Martin grade IV classification. Extensive two-stage Onyx embolization with complete casting of the nidus was performed. The patient delivered healthy twin girls at 36 weeks gestation by a planned cesarean section. This was followed by surgical resection of the AVM 4 months later with minimal blood loss. A follow-up angiogram showed no evidence of AVM recurrence 3 months after surgical resection. Her balance was significantly improved and she walked unassisted. She had mild cerebellar speech. Her twin girls are progressing normally.\nExtensive endovascular Onyx embolization is feasible in the setting of a ruptured high-grade AVM during pregnancy. The rationale for proceeding with treatment is the perceived higher likelihood of re-hemorrhage from such a lesion.",

    "abstract": "Centriole duplication is a tightly regulated process that must occur only once per cell cycle; otherwise, supernumerary centrioles can induce aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. Plk4 (Polo-like kinase 4) activity initiates centriole duplication and is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Throughout interphase, Plk4 autophosphorylation triggers its degradation, thus preventing centriole amplification. However, Plk4 activity is required during mitosis for proper centriole duplication, but the mechanism stabilizing mitotic Plk4 is unknown. In this paper, we show that PP2A (Protein Phosphatase 2A(Twins)) counteracts Plk4 autophosphorylation, thus stabilizing Plk4 and promoting centriole duplication. Like Plk4, the protein level of PP2A's regulatory subunit, Twins (Tws), peaks during mitosis and is required for centriole duplication. However, untimely Tws expression stabilizes Plk4 inappropriately, inducing centriole amplification. Paradoxically, expression of tumor-promoting simian virus 40 small tumor antigen (ST), a reported PP2A inhibitor, promotes centrosome amplification by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that ST actually mimics Tws function in stabilizing Plk4 and inducing centriole amplification.",

The current study aimed to evaluate whether the etiology of this phenomenon is related to twinning, assisted reproductive technology (ART), or both.\nThe study cohort consisted of parturient women who were referred to our ultrasonography unit between January 1998 and December 2009 due to suspicion of severe fetal abnormality. The study cohort was divided into two subgroups based on mode of conception: spontaneous and ART (including IVF and ICSI). The subgroups were further subdivided into singleton and multiple pregnancies. We also compared pregnancies diagnosed with anencephaly in the study group to all live births in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\nAnencephaly was diagnosed in 43 fetuses out of 1154 (3.7%) pregnancies diagnosed with severe fetal anomaly. Anencephaly was diagnosed in 9 out of 78 twin pregnancies (11.5%); of these, 8 of 45 (17.8%) were ART conceived and 1 of 33 (3%) spontaneously conceived. A significant correlation was found between twinning and anencephaly, with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.4 [confidence interval (CI) = 1.3-8.9, P= 0.011], while no significant correlation was found between ART and anencephaly. A significant correlation was found between anencephaly and the combination of ART conception and twinning (OR of 6.6, CI = 2.8-15.3, P< 0.01). Analyzing the distribution of pregnancies diagnosed with anencephaly in the study group compared with the total number of live births in the department revealed a significant correlation between twinning and anencephaly, with an OR of 11.4 (CI = 4.9-26.5, P< 0.01), with no significant correlation between ART and anencephaly. Among all live births, a significant correlation was found between anencephaly and the combination of ART conception and twinning (OR of 24.6, CI = 11.4-53.2, P< 0.01).\nOur data suggest that twin pregnancies conceived by ART constitute a high-risk group for anencephaly, due to a possible synergistic effect of twinning and ART.",

    "abstract": "As monozygotic (MZ) twins are believed to be genetically identical, discordance for disease phenotype between MZ twins has been used in genetic research to understand the contribution of genetic vs environmental factors in disease development. However, recent studies show that MZ twins can differ both genetically and epigenetically. Screening MZ twins for genetic and/or epigenetic differences could be a useful and novel approach to identify modifying factors influencing phenotypic expression of disease. MZ twins that are phenotypically discordant for monogenic diseases are of special interest. Such occurrences have been described for Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, as well as for familial forms of Alzheimer's disease. By comparing MZ twins that are phenotypically discordant, crucial factors influencing the phenotypic expression of the disease could be identified, which may be of relevance for understanding disease pathogenesis and variability in disease phenotype. Overall, understanding the crucial factors in development of a neurodegenerative disorder will have relevance for predictive testing, preventive treatment and could help to identify novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Differential effects of genes and environment can contribute to etiological heterogeneity in schizophrenia. Twins concordant and discordant for schizophrenia may differ in genetic predisposition to schizophrenia with concordant twins having a higher genetic liability and discordant twins having a lower genetic liability to schizophrenia. We aimed to investigate whether P300 amplitude (which has been postulated as a genetic marker for schizophrenia) reflected this heterogeneity.\nWe compared P300 amplitudes across 36 monozygotic twin pairs (6 concordant for schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, 11 discordant and 19 healthy control pairs) performing an auditory oddball task, using multiple regression (age, gender, birth order, premorbid IQ as covariates). We further looked at the correlation between the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and P300 amplitude in affected twins, and compared concordant and discordant affected twins on the Global Assessment Scale (GAS).\nMultiple regression yielded a highly significant model (p = 0.004) though the explained variance was limited (21%). The main effect of the group on P300 amplitude was significant (p = 0.0001): affected concordant twins showed a significantly lower P300 amplitude as compared to affected discordant (p = 0.005, Cohen's d = 1.08) and control twins (p = 0.000, d = 1.16). Discordant affected and unaffected twins did not differ significantly from each other or from control twins. P300 did not correlate significantly with the BPRS and the affected groups did not differ across the GAS.\nOur results provide evidence for etiological heterogeneity within schizophrenia pointing to different pathophysiological mechanisms that may underlie more and less genetically determined forms of schizophrenia. They also indicate that P300 correlates with a differing degree of genetic liability to schizophrenia independently of the psychopathological status and even in the presence of similar functional profiles.",

Uncomplicated dichorionic twins have optimal outcomes when delivered at 38 weeks' gestation. Monochorionic twins, however, are at greater risk for unexpected stillbirth, and a management plan of late preterm delivery (34-37 weeks) after informed consent is reasonable. Monoamniotic twins are at even greater risk for sudden intrauterine fetal demise, and it is recommended that these expectant mothers be managed by inpatient hospitalization with fetal testing 1-3 times per day and delivery between 32 and 34 weeks' gestation. Recommendations are also provided for the circumstance of single intrauterine fetal demise in a twin gestation.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether growth discordance is an independent risk factor in the neonatal outcome of the smaller twin, all medical records of twin pregnancies delivered between 26 and 41 weeks during a 5-year period (January 2004-December 2008) were reviewed. Among the 49 selected twins, weight discordance was 15-20% in 7 infants, 21-30% in 16 infants, 31-40% in 16 infants and > 40% in 10 infants. No significant differences between the four groups were found with regards to obstetric complications and neonatal disease. Occurrence of birthweight below the 10th percentile and rate of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit significantly increased as intra-pair birthweight difference increased (p = .03). The > 40% discordant group had a significantly lower gestational age (p = .03), lower birthweight (p = .007) and a significantly higher mortality rate (4/10 versus 3/39 p = .04) in comparison with the other discordant groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that birthweight was the single independent and consistent factor associated with elevated risks of mortality. For every 250 g increase in birthweight, the risk for mortality decreased by about 84% [RR 0.16(CI 0.00-0.70)]. Gestational age was the most reliable predictor for major neonatal complications. For every 1-week increase in gestational age a significant decreased risk for all outcomes was found. Discordance alone should not be considered as a predictor for adverse neonatal outcome. Neonatal outcome in discordant twins appears to be related to gestational age and birthweight rather than to the degree of discordance.",

    "abstract": "The timing and developmental sequence of events for BCR-ABL1(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), usually associated with IKAROS (IKZF1) deletions, are unknown. We assessed the status of BCR-ABL1 and IKZF1 genes in 2 pairs of monozygotic twins, one pair concordant, the other discordant for Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph(+)) ALL. The twin pair concordant for ALL shared identical BCR-ABL1 genomic sequence indicative of monoclonal, in utero origin. One twin had IKZF1 deletion and died after transplantation. The other twin had hyperdiploidy, no IKZF1 deletion, and is still in remission 8 years after transplantation. In the twin pair discordant for ALL, neonatal blood spots from both twins harbored the same clonotypic BCR-ABL1 sequence. Low level BCR-ABL1(+) cells were present in the healthy co-twin but lacked the IKZF1 deletion present in the other twin's leukemic cells. The twin with ALL relapsed and died after transplantation. The co-twin remains healthy and leukemia free. These data show that in childhood Ph(+) ALL, BCR-ABL1 gene fusion can be a prenatal and possibly initiating genetic event. In the absence of additional, secondary changes, the leukemic clone remains clinically silent. IKZF1 is a secondary and probable postnatal mutation in these cases, and as a recurrent but alternative copy number change is associated with poor prognosis.",

    "abstract": "We describe monozygotic twins with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) associated to antiphospholipid antibodies with a dissimilar clinical expression. The first patient was diagnosed to have ITP at 63 years old and was treated with corticosteroids. She presented ulterior exacerbations of thrombocytopenia requiring intravenous immunoglobulin and subsequent treatment with rituximab. She ultimately had a favorable response without thrombotic events during follow-up. The second patient who had a history of three spontaneous abortions and endometrial adenocarcinoma in complete remission was evaluated for severe thrombocytopenia, ITP was diagnosed at the age of 63. She was treated with steroids and had a favorable response. After few months she developed deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism requiring anticoagulation therapy without hemorrhagic events. Both patients were found to have antiphospholipid antibodies and HLA DR4 (DRB1*04) and HLA DR5 (DRB1*12). The association of those two entities in monozygotic twins could support the presence of common predisposing genes. However, with both patients being genotipically identical, the clinical expression was different. Those cases highlight the possibility that environmental factors may affect the expression of those disorders.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective cohort study was carried out in a university teaching hospital to determine the prospective risk of unexpected fetal death in uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies after viability. All MCDA twins delivered at or after 24 weeks' gestation from July 1999 to July 2007 were included. Pregnancies with twin-twin transfusion syndrome, growth restriction, structural abnormalities, or twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence were excluded. Of the 144 MCDA twin pregnancies included in our analysis, the risk of intrauterine death was 4.9%. The prospective risk of unexpected intrauterine death was 1 in 43 after 32 weeks' gestation and 1 in 37 after 34 weeks' gestation. Our results demonstrate that despite close surveillance, the unexpected intrauterine death rate in uncomplicated MCDA twin pregnancies is high. This rate seems to increase after 34 weeks' gestation, suggesting that a policy of elective preterm delivery warrants evaluation.",

    "abstract": "We studied whether self-reported intent to exert cognitive control over eating was associated with differences in brain response to food cues, independent of genetic background. Subjects were ten pairs of identical twins in which one twin was a restrained eater and the co-twin was unrestrained, as classified by the Herman and Polivy Restraint Scale. Before and after ingestion of a milkshake, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain response to photographs of objects, \"fattening\" food, and \"non-fattening\" food. At baseline, restrained eaters had greater activation in the left amygdala and the right thalamus in response to fattening food cues than did their unrestrained co-twins. When restrained eaters drank a milkshake, activation in response to fattening food photographs decreased across multiple brain areas, whereas activation induced by non-fattening food photographs increased. As compared to their unrestrained co-twins, restrained eaters who drank a milkshake had greater decreases in activation by fattening food images in the left amygdala and occipital lobe, and greater increases in activation by non-fattening food images in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. Because of the discordant monozygotic twin study design, the findings provide a rigorous level of support for the hypothesis that adopting an intention to restrain eating alters brain response to food cues.",

They were divided into two groups on the basis of BW discordance as follows: large (>7.5%) and small (\ue2fa7.5%). Cord blood renin, aldosterone, hANP and BNP levels were measured.\nRenin levels in MD twins with a large BW discordance were significantly higher than those in MD twins with a small BW discordance, with no significant differences in aldosterone, hANP and BNP levels. A significant correlation was found between renin levels and BW discordance.\nRenin is activated in MD twins with a BW discordance of >7.5%, even in non-TTTS.",

    "abstract": "This report describes a pair of identical twins with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). One of them showed diffuse mesangial proliferation with crescent formations in the glomeruli, moderate proteinuria and required intensive therapies including corticosteroids for remission. In contrast, the other had only focal mesangial alterations and exhibited only a subtle level of urinary abnormalities throughout the follow-up without steroid therapy. Although our monozygotic twins have completely identical genotypes, the clinicopathological features of their IgAN were quite discordant. The present cases suggest that not only genetic factors but also epigenetic differences may be involved in the progression of IgAN.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the association between sleep duration and insulin resistance in rural Chinese adults and examine whether any such associations are independent of adiposity.\nThis is a cross-sectional analysis of 854 men and 640 women aged 20 to 70 years from the Anqing Twin Cohort. The following measures were obtained for each subject: Body mass index (BMI) and percentage of trunk fat (%TF), fasting plasma glucose, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), self-reported sleep duration and measures of snoring and sleep disturbance from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Indices (PSQI) questionnaire were modified for a Chinese population. Multivariate linear regressions were applied to examine the association of sleep duration with HOMA-IR, with and without adjustment for adiposity variables, along with other relevant covariates.\nIn this sample of relatively lean rural Chinese adults, short sleep duration was associated with HOMA-IR in women but not in men. In women, short (\u2264 7 h/night) sleep duration was associated with a higher HOMA-IR (p=0.003) compared with normal sleep duration (>7 to \u2264 8 h/night) after adjustment for all the covariates except adiposity. Further adjustment for BMI or %TF attenuated the sleep-HOMA-IR association, but the association remained significant upon adjustment for BMI (p=0.013); and upon adjustment for %TF (p=0.026). Long sleep duration (> 8 h/night) was not significantly associated with HOMA-IR.\nIn this rural Chinese cohort, short sleep duration is independently associated with increased insulin resistance among women only, even after adjusting for adiposity and other potential confounders.",

    "abstract": "A first case of newborn Tibetan macaque (Macaca thibetana) twins was observed in a free-ranging group at Huangshan, China. The female that gave birth to the twins was studied during their first 5 months post-partum, and her activity budget was compared to those of adult females with single or no offspring in order to assess her behavioral changes. Our report shows that female Tibetan macaques can produce twins, and that twins can successfully survive. The adult female with twins spent more time foraging and resting, but less time moving and engaged in other social behaviors than adult females with a single infant or no infant. Our report provides a case of successfully surviving twins in a wild environment and suggests that the mother modified her behavior patterns to adapt to the heavy burden. We conclude that both food provisioning and the mother's behavioral strategies facilitated the survivorship of twins. This expands our understanding of the reproductive biology of Tibetan macaques.",

    "abstract": "We sought to determine whether twin gestations with an anomalous fetus are at increased risk of preterm delivery or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) compared to twins with 2 normal fetuses.\nThis was a retrospective cohort of twins undergoing ultrasound 15-22 weeks' gestation. Groups were defined by the presence of 1 twin with a major anomaly (discordant) or by twins with no major anomalies (normal). The primary outcomes were preterm delivery (<37 weeks) and IUGR (<10th percentile).\nOf 1977 twin pregnancies, 66 had a twin with a major anomaly. Preterm delivery occurred in 42 (63.6%) discordant twins, compared to 1271 (66.5%) normal twins (risk ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-1.2). IUGR was diagnosed in 15 (22.7%) normal co-twins, compared to 406 (21.3%) presenting twins in normal twins (risk ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-1.7).\nTwins discordant for major anomalies are not at increased risk of preterm delivery or IUGR compared to twins with no major anomalies.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of craniopagus twins approximates four to six per 10 million births. Although rare, surgical separation of conjoined twins poses significant technical and ethical challenges. The present report uses the case of craniopagus twins AD and TD to examine the bioethical issues faced by a multidisciplinary medical team in planning the separation of craniopagus twins. AD and TD are craniopagus twins conjoined at the head. TD's head is conjoined to the back of AD's head. Neurologically, AD has the dominant cerebral circulation. TD has two normal kidneys, whereas AD has none. AD depends on TD's renal function and, on separation, will require either a kidney transplant or lifelong dialysis. This case report reviews one approach to analyzing and solving complex ethical dilemmas in pediatric plastic surgery. The principles reviewed are (1) autonomy and informed consent, focusing especially on the role of children in the informed consent process; (2) beneficence and nonmaleficence, two intricately intertwined principles because separation could potentially cause irreversible harm to one twin while improving the quality of life for the other (as separation is not a life-saving procedure, is it ethical to perform a procedure with unknown surgical risk to improve children's quality of life?); and (3) justice (is it fair to allocate excessive medical resources for the twins' separation?). The present report explores the ethics behind such decisions with respect to the separation of conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "The cardiometabolic syndrome comprised of multiple correlated traits, but its origin is incompletely understood. Chromogranin A (CHGA) is required for formation of the catecholamine secretory pathway in sympathochromaffin cells. In twin pair studies, we found that CHGA traits aggregated with body mass index (BMI), as well as its biochemical determinant leptin. METHODS Here we used the twin method to probe the role of heredity in generating such risk traits, and then investigated the role of risk-trait-associated CHGA promoter genetic variation in transfected chromaffin cells. Trait heritability (h(2)) and shared genetic determination among traits (pleiotropy, genetic covariance, \u03c1(G)) were estimated by variance components in twin pairs.\nCHGA, BMI, and leptin each displayed substantial h(2), and the traits also aggregated with several features of the metabolic syndrome (e.g., insulin resistance, blood pressure (BP), hypertension, catecholamines, and C-reactive protein (CRP)). Twin studies demonstrated genetic covariance (pleiotropy, \u03c1(G)) for CHGA, BMI, and leptin with other metabolic traits (insulin resistance, BP, and CRP). We therefore investigated the CHGA locus for mechanisms of codetermination with such metabolic traits. A common functional variant in the human CHGA promoter (G-462A, rs9658634, minor allele frequency ~21%) was associated with leptin and CRP secretion, as well as BMI, especially in women; marker-on-trait effects on BMI were replicated across twin populations on two continents. In CHGA promoter/luciferase reporter plasmids transfected into chromaffin cells, G-462A alleles differed markedly in reporter expression. The G-462A variant disrupted predicted transcriptional control by a PPAR\u03b3/RXR\u03b1 motif and costimulation by PPAR\u03b3/RXR\u03b1 and their cognate ligands, differentially activated the two alleles. During chromatin immunoprecipitation, endogenous PPAR\u03b3 bound the motif.\nMultiple features of the metabolic syndrome are thus under joint (pleiotropic) genetic determination, with CHGA as one such contributory locus: a common polymorphism in the promoter (G-462A) of CHGA predicts such heritable metabolic traits as BMI and leptin. CHGA promoter variant G-462A was not only associated with such metabolic traits but also disrupted a PPAR\u03b3/RXR\u03b1 motif and responded differentially to characteristic trans-activators of that motif. The results suggest novel links between the catecholaminergic system and risk for the metabolic syndrome as well as systemic hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the aetiology of the links between sleep disturbance and anxiety and depression symptoms. The aim of this study was to estimate genetic and environmental influences on these associations.\nQuestionnaires were completed by 1556 young adults from twin and sibling pairs (61.5% female).\nSleep disturbance was moderately correlated with symptoms of anxiety (r=.39) and depression (r=.50). There was substantial overlap between genes influencing sleep disturbance and those influencing symptoms of anxiety (rA=.58) and depression (rA=.68). Overall, the associations between sleep and symptoms of both anxiety and depression were mainly due to genes (explaining 74% and 58% of the covariances respectively), with the remainder due to nonshared environmental factors.\nModerate phenotypic and genetic correlations between the phenotypes support the view that sleep disturbance is related to the presence of various psychiatric difficulties, but also warrants independent consideration and treatment.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: to identify differences in echocardiographic profiles of monochorionic/diamniotic pregnancies with early or mild twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), compared to monochorionic/diamniotic twins affected only by discordant growth or discordant fluid. STUDY DESIGN: retrospective evaluation of sonograms and echocardiograms of twin pregnancies referred for suspected TTTS. RESULTS: 112 monochorionic/diamniotic pairs were studied. 41 did not have/develop TTTS, 61 had Stage I/II TTTS. Ten developed TTTS after initially not meeting criteria. TTTS recipients had a higher rate of venous Doppler or tricuspid inflow abnormalities than purported \"recipients\" in non-TTTS pregnancies (86% vs. 37%, P<0.001). TTTS recipients had shorter tricuspid inflow duration/RR intervals than non-TTTS fetuses (32+/-6% versus 37+/-4%, P<0.001). Logistic regression and recursive partitioning identified shorter tricuspid inflow duration, longer isovolumic relaxation, and ductus venosus abnormality associated with TTTS. CONCLUSION: Diastolic pathology, specifically shorter tricuspid inflow duration, may be considered a hallmark of TTTS distinguishing these pregnancies from other monochorionic/diamniotic twin complications.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the major psychoses, schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD), have traditionally focused on genetic and environmental risk factors, although more recent work has highlighted an additional role for epigenetic processes in mediating susceptibility. Since monozygotic (MZ) twins share a common DNA sequence, their study represents an ideal design for investigating the contribution of epigenetic factors to disease etiology. We performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation on peripheral blood DNA samples obtained from a unique sample of MZ twin pairs discordant for major psychosis. Numerous loci demonstrated disease-associated DNA methylation differences between twins discordant for SZ and BD individually, and together as a combined major psychosis group. Pathway analysis of our top loci highlighted a significant enrichment of epigenetic changes in biological networks and pathways directly relevant to psychiatric disorder and neurodevelopment. The top psychosis-associated, differentially methylated region, significantly hypomethylated in affected twins, was located in the promoter of ST6GALNAC1 overlapping a previously reported rare genomic duplication observed in SZ. The mean DNA methylation difference at this locus was 6%, but there was considerable heterogeneity between families, with some twin pairs showing a 20% difference in methylation. We subsequently assessed this region in an independent sample of postmortem brain tissue from affected individuals and controls, finding marked hypomethylation (>25%) in a subset of psychosis patients. Overall, our data provide further evidence to support a role for DNA methylation differences in mediating phenotypic differences between MZ twins and in the etiology of both SZ and BD.",

    "abstract": "Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) plays a key role in dopamine and estrogen metabolism. Recently, COMT haplotypes rather than the single polymorphism Val158Met have been reported to underlie differences in protein expression by modulating mRNA secondary structure. So far, studies investigating the epigenetic variability of the S-COMT (soluble COMT) promoter region mainly focused on phenotypical aspects, and results have been controversial.\nWe assessed S-COMT promoter methylation in saliva and blood derived DNA with regard to early pre- and postnatal growth as well as to genotype for polymorphisms rs6269, rs4633, and rs4680 (Val158Met) in 20 monozygotic twin pairs (mean age 4 years), who were discordant for intrauterine development due to severe feto-fetal-transfusion syndrome. Methylation levels of two previously reported partially methylated cytosines were determined by the quantitative SIRPH (SNuPE- IP RP HPLC) assay.\nOverall, we observed a high variability of S-COMT promoter methylation, which did not correlate with individual differences in the pre- or postnatal growth pattern. Within the twin pairs however we noted a distinct similarity that could be linked to underlying COMT genotypes. This association was subsequently confirmed in a cohort of 93 unrelated adult controls. Interestingly, 158Val-alleles were found at both ends of the epigenotypical range, which is in accordance with a recently proposed model of COMT haplotypes corresponding to a continuum of phenotypical variability.\nThe strong heritable component of S-COMT promoter methylation found in our study needs to be considered in future approaches that focus on interactions between COMT epigenotype and phenotype.",

    "results": "Overall, we observed a high variability of S-COMT promoter methylation, which did not correlate with individual differences in the pre- or postnatal growth pattern. Within the twin pairs however we noted a distinct similarity that could be linked to underlying COMT genotypes. This association was subsequently confirmed in a cohort of 93 unrelated adult controls. Interestingly, 158Val-alleles were found at both ends of the epigenotypical range, which is in accordance with a recently proposed model of COMT haplotypes corresponding to a continuum of phenotypical variability.",

    "abstract": "Stability or changes of health behaviours have not been studied in association with incidence of disability pension (DP). The aims were to (1) investigate if stability or changes in health behaviours predict DP due to musculoskeletal diagnosis (MSD), (2) to evaluate if an association exists for DP in general, and (3) after taking familial confounding into account.\nThe study sample was 16,713 like-sexed twin individuals born in Sweden between 1935-1958 (6195 complete twin pairs) who had participated in two surveys 25 years apart, were alive, and not pensioned at the time of the latest survey. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the associations (hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) between stability and change in health behaviours (physical activity, tobacco and alcohol use, body mass index (BMI)), and number of pain locations collected at two time points 25 years apart and the incidence of DP until 2008.\nDuring the follow-up, 1843 (11%) individuals were granted DP with 747 of these due to MSD. A higher proportion of women were granted DP than men. Increase in BMI and stable use of tobacco products were predictors for DP due to MSD (HR 1.21-1.48) and DP in general (HR 1.10-1.41). The stability in the frequency of physical activity and increased frequency of physical activity were protective factors for DP due to MSD only when accounting for familial confounding. However, the number of pain locations (stability, increase, or decrease) was the strongest predictor for future DP due to MSD (HR 3.69, CI 2.99-4.56) and DP in general (HR 2.15, CI 1.92-2.42). In discordant pair analysis, the HRs for pain were lower, indicating potential familial confounding.\nHealth behaviours in adulthood, including an increase in pain locations were associated with the incidence of DP. The association between physical activity and DP was especially related to adulthood choices or habits, i.e., the individual decision about frequency of exercising. Thus, it is important to e.g. increase public awareness of the potential beneficial effects of exercise throughout life to avoid permanent exclusion from the labour market for medical reasons.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex encephalitis is an infrequent infection with high mortality and morbidity. Antiviral therapies decrease mortality but long term sequelae are still high, so early diagnosis is important for opportune treatment. We present a pair of twins with central nervous system herpes simplex infection during the first month of life. Both twins presented non-specific symptoms and consulted with 48 hours apart needing intensive care admission, the first one for noninvasive mechanical ventilation and the second for hemodynamic support. Diagnosis was made by cerebrospinal fluid PCR, in the first twin at day 9 of disease and in the second at admission. Both twins were treated with acyclovir, but only the second one at the beginning of her illness. Initial study with electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance was normal and cerebrospinal fluid on day 18 of treatment was negative for herpes simplex virus DNA detection in both patients.",

    "abstract": "We identified four cases of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) in one Utah family, originally from Southwestern Mexico. The index cases were twin girls born at 35 weeks gestation, in whom the combination of hyperbilirubinemia, reticulocytosis and elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) led to studies that confirmed the diagnosis of HS. Scleral icterus in their 4-year-old sibling and in their mother led to the diagnosis of HS in them as well. Although much less commonly reported in Hispanic neonates than in those of Northern European ancestry, HS does occur among Hispanic neonates and can contribute to significant neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. These cases are consistent with our earlier report, which identified an MCHC cutoff of >36 as suggestive of further evaluation for HS.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to use a fixed reference to study movement (displacement) of the cervical internal os from the second to the third trimester in singletons and twins. The rationale was to gain insight into anatomic changes associated with cervical shortening.\nFor each patient, 2 transperineal scans were performed 12 weeks apart (20 and 32 weeks). The internal os and symphysis pubis were visualized in the same field of view. Image registration techniques were used to align the 2 scans using the symphysis as a fixed reference. Total displacement, anterior displacement, and inferior displacement of the internal os were measured. Displacements were correlated with cervical shortening. Bland-Altman plots and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated.\nA total of 42 healthy participants were studied: 28 with singletons and 14 with twins. The mean \u00b1 SD values for total displacement were 2.1 \u00b1 1.2 and 2.0 \u00b1 1.2 cm for singletons and twins, respectively (P = .75). The direction of displacement was significantly different. The mean anterior displacement was 1.1 cm greater for singletons than for twins (95% confidence interval, 0.29-2.0 cm, P = .01). Mean inferior displacement was 1.3 cm greater for twins than for singletons (95% confidence interval, 2.2-0.1 cm; P = .03). Only inferior displacement correlated with cervical shortening (P < .001; R(2) = 0.74). For every 2.2 cm of inferior displacement, the cervix shortened 1.0 cm. Assessments of reliability showed good agreement between 2 observers.\nThe anatomic position of the internal cervical os depends on gestational age and fetal number. Cervical shortening correlated most strongly with inferior displacement.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 16% of twin gestations have discordance of at least 20%. We identified 14 risk factors for divergent growth that can be categorized as maternal, fetal, or placental. Determination of chorionicity and serial ultrasound evaluation with a high index of suspicion for divergent growth is required for the diagnosis and stratification of risk. The highest reported likelihood ratio for detection of discordance was 5.9 during the first trimester examination and 6.0 for the second trimester. Although our ability to identify discordant twins is limited, once suspected and at viable gestational age, these pregnancies should have antepartum testing. Discordant growth alone is not an indication for preterm birth. Although there are multiple publications on the increased morbidity and mortality rates with discordant growth, there is a paucity of reports on how to manage them optimally and deliver them in a timely manner.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to analyze conjoined twins in terms of antenatal, delivery and postnatal aspects.\nA retrospective descriptive analysis of prenatally diagnosed conjoined twins. Prenatal ultrasound and echocardiography, delivery details, postnatal follow-up, surgical separation and post mortem data were reviewed. The twins were classified according to the type of fusion between fetal structures. The following data were analyzed: ultrasound and echocardiographic findings, antenatal lethality and possibility of surgical separation, delivery details and survival rates.\nForty cases of conjoined twins were included in the study. There were 72.5% cases of thoracophagus, 12.5% of paraphagus, 7.5% of omphalo-ischiophagus, 5.0% of omphalophagus, and 2.5% of cephalophagus. Judicial termination of pregnancy was requested in 58.8% of the cases. Cesarean section was performed in all cases in which pregnancy was not terminated. The mean gestational age at delivery was 35 weeks; all twins were live births with a mean birth weight of 3,860 g and 88% died postnatally. Ten percent of the live borns were submitted to surgical separation with a 60% survival rate. The total survival rate was 7.5% and postnatal survival was 12%. Antenatal evaluation of lethality and possibility of surgical separation were precise. There were no maternal complications related to delivery.\nConjoined twins present a dismal prognosis mainly related to the complex cardiac fusion present in the majority of cases with thoracic sharing. At referring centers, prenatal ultrasound and echocardiographic evaluation accurately delineate fetal prognosis and the possibility of postnatal surgical separation.",

    "abstract": "Research has found that patients treated for cancer generally have an increased risk for cognitive problems. However, many studies have focused on cognitive performance of cancer patients under the age of 65 who received chemotherapy treatment. Less studied is the extent to which cancer diagnosis may be associated with cognitive impairment as a late effect for older adults.\nIn this retrospective, co-twin design study, twin pairs 65 years of age and older discordant for cancer were identified from the Swedish Twin Registry. A pair was included if both twins participated in cognitive screening, and the twin with the cancer history was screened at least 3 years after cancer diagnosis and treatment.\nFemale, but not male, survivors of cancer were significantly (odds ratio = 2.42, 95% confidence interval = 1.23-4.74) more likely to exhibit cognitive impairment 3 or more years after cancer diagnosis and treatment as their co-twin without a history of cancer. In particular, risk was higher among survivors of gynecologic cancers (odds ratio = 10.00, 95% confidence interval = 1.28-78.11) and those who had treatments directly or potentially affecting ovarian functioning (odds ratio = 13.00, 95% confidence interval = 1.70-99.36) compared with their respective co-twins.\nThese findings suggest that localized treatments and other cancer-related factors should be explored as determinants that underlie the association between cancer diagnosis and long-term cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Cell division and development are regulated by networks of kinases and phosphatases. In early Drosophila embryogenesis, 13 rapid nuclear divisions take place in a syncytium, requiring fine coordination between cell cycle regulators. The Polo kinase is a conserved, crucial regulator of M-phase. We have recently reported an antagonism between Polo and Greatwall (Gwl), another mitotic kinase, in Drosophila embryos. However, the nature of the pathways linking them remained elusive. We have conducted a comprehensive screen for additional genes functioning with polo and gwl. We uncovered a strong interdependence between Polo and Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) with its B-type subunit Twins (Tws). Reducing the maternal contribution of Polo and PP2A-Tws together is embryonic lethal. We found that Polo and PP2A-Tws collaborate to ensure centrosome attachment to nuclei. While a reduction in Polo activity leads to centrosome detachments observable mostly around prophase, a reduction in PP2A-Tws activity leads to centrosome detachments at mitotic exit, and a reduction in both Polo and PP2A-Tws enhances the frequency of detachments at all stages. Moreover, we show that Gwl antagonizes PP2A-Tws function in both meiosis and mitosis. Our study highlights how proper coordination of mitotic entry and exit is required during embryonic cell cycles and defines important roles for Polo and the Gwl-PP2A-Tws pathway in this process.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to examine the similarities in effects of exercise training and a hypocaloric diet within overweight female monozygotic twin pairs and to assess differences in twin partners' responses depending on the timing of exercise bouts and main meals. Six previously untrained twin pairs (aged 20-37 years, body fat 35.8\u00b16.3%) performed an identical exercise program (12 bouts endurance and 8 bouts resistance training) and took part in a nutrition counseling program for a period of 28 days. They pursued one identical goal: to lose body weight and fat. Each twin partner was randomly assigned to one of the two intervention groups: \"exercise after dinner\" (A) and \"exercise before dinner\" (B). Subjects followed a hypocaloric diet, supervised by a nutritionist, in free-living conditions. Reductions in body weight, waist and hip circumference, glucose tolerance, mean daily %fat intake, changes in morning resting energy rate and resting metabolic rate showed great variation between twin pairs, but only small variation within twin pairs. Thus, the genetic influence on the changes in most of the examined anthropometric and physiological variables was high. There was no influence of the specific timing on the dependent variables.",

    "abstract": "Twins have been extensively used in economics, sociology, and behavioral genetics to investigate the role of genetic endowments on a broad range of social, demographic, and economic outcomes. However, the focus in these literatures has been distinct.: The economic literature has been primarily concerned with the need to control for unobserved endowments--including as an important subset, genetic endowments--in analyses that attempt to establish the impact of one variable, often schooling, on a variety of economic, demographic, and health outcomes. Behavioral genetic analyses have mostly been concerned with decomposing the variation in the outcomes of interest into genetic, shared environmental, and non-shared environmental components, with recent multivariate analyses investigating the contributions of genes and the environment to the correlation and causation between variables. Despite the fact that twins studies and the recognition of the role of endowments are central to both of these literatures, they have mostly evolved independently. In this paper we develop formally the relationship between the economic and behavioral genetic approaches to the analyses of twins, and we develop an integrative approach that combines the identification of causal effects, which dominates the economic literature, with the decomposition of variances and covariances into genetic and environmental factors that are the primary goal of behavioral genetic approaches. We apply this integrative ACE-beta approach to an illustrative investigation of the impact of schooling on several demographic outcomes such as fertility and nuptiality and health.",

    "abstract": "This case presents a complication of attempted separation of parapagus conjoined twins, related to loss of an intact mesenteric-portal venous axis. Despite known lack of a superior mesenteric artery in the right twin, initial evaluation in the operating room suggested that separation was possible. After hepatic division, however, it became apparent that the mesenteric drainage was not separable; and the operation was aborted. Subsequently, significant growth failure and hypoglycemia were noted in the right twin. The situation was corrected by creating a shunt to reinstitute mesenteric flow to the right twin's liver and separating the twin's mesenteric drainage. One year postoperatively, both twins are independently nourishing themselves and have been free from hospitalization with stable glucoses.",

    "abstract": "Schooling generally is positively associated with better health-related outcomes-for example, less hospitalization and later mortality-but these associations do not measure whether schooling causes better health-related outcomes. Schooling may in part be a proxy for unobserved endowments-including family background and genetics-that both are correlated with schooling and have direct causal effects on these outcomes. This study addresses the schooling-health-gradient issue with twins methodology, using rich data from the Danish Twin Registry linked to population-based registries to minimize random and systematic measurement error biases. We find strong, significantly negative associations between schooling and hospitalization and mortality, but generally no causal effects of schooling.",

A hypothetical case of infant conjoined twins from Angel Mounds, a Middle Mississippian site (A.D. 1050-1400) on the Ohio River near Evansville, Indiana, was discovered in 1941. Morphological analysis does not rule out the field interpretation of this double burial as twins. Ancient mitochondrial DNA recovered from both infants demonstrates that they were not maternal relatives, and hence that they cannot have been conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of cardiovascular risk in adults. Patterns and determinants of CRP in adolescents have not been well described.\nThis study aimed to determine how CRP varies by age, gender, Tanner stage, and body fat composition in rural Chinese adolescents and to what degree adiposity-CRP associations are attributable to shared genetic and environmental factors.\nData were derived from an ongoing study of metabolic syndrome in a large community-based twin cohort enrolled in Anqing, China.\nThe study sample included 1180 adolescent twins aged 13-21 yr.\nPlasma CRP concentrations were measured by sandwich immunoassay using flow metric xMAP technology. Body fat composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.\nCRP levels linearly increased across age and Tanner stage in males (P \u2264 0.0001), but in females, CRP exhibited no trend after adjusting for fat mass (P > 0.05). For males, the most explanatory measure was body mass index (partial r(2) = 5.2%), whereas percent body fat (partial r(2) = 8.8%) was more explanatory in females. Of the phenotypic correlations between adiposity measures and CRP (0.25-0.28), 86-89% were attributed to shared genetic factors and 11-14% to common unique environmental factors in both sexes.\nAdiposity is a strong determinant of CRP even in this relatively lean Chinese population. There is notable gender difference for the CRP pattern and the relationship of CRP with adiposity during adolescence. To a large degree, common genetic factors may underlie the observed adiposity-CRP-phenotypic correlations.",

Several fetal interventions, such as serial amnioreduction (AR), fetoscopic laser coagulation of placental anastomoses (FLC) and selective feticide have lead to improved perinatal morbidity and mortality rates. Nevertheless, the rate of cerebral lesions in MC twins after fetal therapy appears to be high. Follow-up studies show a high incidence of cerebral palsy (CP) and neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI). We performed a systematic review on the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in MC twins with TTTS following AR and FLC and MC twins following selective feticide of the co-twin due to TTTS, TRAP, sIUGR and congenital anomalies.",

    "abstract": "RNases are enzymes that cleave RNAs, resulting in remarkably diverse biological consequences. Many RNases are cytotoxic. In some cases, they attack selectively malignant cells triggering an apoptotic response. A number of eukaryotic and bacterial RNase-based strategies are being developed for use in anticancer and antiviral therapy. However, the physiological functions of these RNases are often poorly understood. This review focuses on the properties of the extracellular RNases from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (barnase) and Bacillus intermedius (binase), the characteristics of their biosynthesis regulation and their physiological role, with an emphasis on the similarities and differences. Barnase and binase can be regarded as molecular twins according to their highly similar structure, physical-chemical and catalytic properties. Nevertheless, the 'life paths' of these enzymes are not the same, as their expression in bacteria is controlled by diverse signals. Binase is predominantly synthesized under phosphate starvation, whereas barnase production is strictly dependent on the multifunctional Spo0A regulator controlling sporulation, biofilm formation and cannibalism. Barnase and binase also have some distinctions in practical applications. Barnase was initially suggested to be useful in research and biotechnology as a tool for studying protein-protein interactions, for RNA elimination from biological samples, for affinity purification of RNase fusion proteins, for the development of cloning vectors and for sterility acquisition by transgenic plants. Binase, as later barnase, was tested for antiviral, antitumour and immunogenic effects. Both RNases have found their own niche in cancer research as a result of success in targeted delivery and selectivity towards tumour cells.",

    "abstract": "The Danish Twin Registry (DTR) has for more than 50 years been based on surveys and clinical investigations and over the two last decades also on register linkage. Currently these two approaches are merged within Statistics Denmark.\nHere we report on three major groups of register-based research in the DTR that used the uniqueness of twinning. First, we focus on the ''long-term prognosis'' of being a twin compared with being a singleton and show that Danish twins have health trajectories in adulthood similar to singletons, which is a result of interest for twins and their families as well as a test of the fetal origins hypothesis that states that fetal growth restriction has long-term health consequences. Secondly, we summarise some of the most important register-based ''classical twin studies'', e.g. heritability studies on lifespan and exceptional longevity. Finally, we illustrate how the co-twin control method in a register setting can be used to control for the effect of rearing environment and genetic factors in studies of the association between exposures and health.\nThe spectrum of register-based twin studies is very wide and have changed in accordance with methodological and data resource developments.",

    "abstract": "We describe trends in the rates of admission of preterm twin and triplet infants to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) across Canada and compare their neonatal outcomes over a 6-year period. Temporal trends of admission rates for 5193 twins and triplets < 33 weeks' gestational age to participating NICUs in the Canadian Neonatal Network between 2003 and 2008 were assessed. Trends in infant outcomes were evaluated using logistic regression. The proportion of twins increased from 26.1 to 28.0 per 100 admissions between 2003 and 2008 (7% increase, p = 0.02). In contrast, the proportion of triplets decreased from 5.0 to 3.3 per 100 admissions (34% reduction, p = 0.04). These trends were significant in mothers \u2265 35 years of age. Neonatal outcomes improved for preterm twins (mortality, p < 0.01; survival without any major morbidity, p < 0.01; severe neurological injury, p = 0.02; and severe retinopathy of prematurity, p = 0.03). Similar improvements were observed for triplets, but the sample size was insufficient to reach statistical significance. The rate of NICU admissions for preterm twins at < 33 weeks' gestation has increased in recent years, whereas for triplets it has gradually declined. Neonatal outcomes of preterm twins improved over the study period.",

    "abstract": "Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) falls within a group of pediatric disorders with both respiratory control and autonomic nervous system dysregulation. Children with ROHHAD typically present after 1.5 years of age with rapid weight gain as the initial sign. Subsequently, they develop alveolar hypoventilation, autonomic nervous system dysregulation, and, if untreated, cardiorespiratory arrest. To our knowledge, this is the first report of discordant presentation of ROHHAD in monozygotic twins. Twin girls, born at term, had concordant growth and development until 8 years of age. From 8 to 12 years of age, the affected twin developed features characteristic of ROHHAD including obesity, alveolar hypoventilation, scoliosis, hypothalamic dysfunction (central diabetes insipidus, hypothyroidism, premature pubarche, and growth hormone deficiency), right paraspinal/thoracic ganglioneuroblastoma, seizures, and autonomic dysregulation including altered pain perception, large and sluggishly reactive pupils, hypothermia, and profound bradycardia that required a cardiac pacemaker. Results of genetic testing for PHOX2B (congenital central hypoventilation syndrome disease-defining gene) mutations were negative. With early recognition and conservative management, the affected twin had excellent neurocognitive outcome that matched that of the unaffected twin. The unaffected twin demonstrated rapid weight gain later in age but not development of signs/symptoms consistent with ROHHAD. This discordant twin pair demonstrates key features of ROHHAD including the importance of early recognition (especially hypoventilation), complexity of signs/symptoms and clinical course, and importance of initiating comprehensive, multispecialty care. These cases confound the hypothesis of a monogenic etiology for ROHHAD and indicate alternative etiologies including autoimmune or epigenetic phenomenon or a combination of genetic predisposition and acquired precipitant.",

If confirmed, this would suggest that antiretroviral therapy might benefit patients suffering from CFS. We validated a set of assays for XMRV and evaluated the prevalence of XMRV in a cohort of monozygotic twins discordant for CFS. Stored peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were tested with 3 separate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (one of which was nested) for XMRV DNA, and serum/plasma was tested for XMRV RNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. None of the PBMC samples from the twins with CFS or their unaffected co-twins was positive for XMRV, by any of the assays. One plasma sample, from an unaffected co-twin, was reproducibly positive by RT-PCR. However, serum from the same day was negative, as was a follow-up plasma sample obtained 2 days after the positive specimen. These data do not support an association of XMRV with CFS.",

Subepidermal blister with vacuolar degeneration of basal cell layer and the heavy infiltration of mononuclear cells in the upper dermis were observed in the blister lesion. She also had generalized livedo. Her identical twin sister did not exhibit ulcers or blisters, but was born with milia on her limbs.

    "abstract": "There is paucity of literature on the incidence and clinical associations of transient benign dermatological conditions in twin neonates. This prospective study evaluated 253 live-born twin babies (\u226523 wks) at a tertiary care hospital in Delhi, India. All study subjects were observed for the first 7 days of life, and regular dermatological examination was performed. The primary focus was on palatine Epstein pearls (PEP), milia, erythema toxicum neonatorum (ETN), and physiological skin desquamation (PDS). Zygosity was determined with the help of sex combination of the pairs, chorionicity of the placentae, and seven blood group phenotypes. Chi-square test, Cohen's kappa test, and logistic regression analysis were done. PEP, milia, ETN, and PDS were seen in 88.1%, 83.4%, 2.4%, and 4.3% twin babies, respectively. Preputial Epstein pearls were not seen. Birth order, maternal anemia, route of delivery, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, gestational maturity, birth weight, and presence of intrauterine growth restriction were found to be associated with one or more of the studied skin conditions (p < 0.05), but maternal age, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and sex of the baby did not affect incidence of any (p > 0.05). The intrapair concordance was highly significant (p < 0.001) in mono- and dizygotic twins. PEP and milia were equally common in the evaluated twins as compared to reports in singletons, while ETN and PDS were less common in this twin cohort. Environmental and genetic factors may regulate physiological skin manifestations in newborns.",

Although presumed to be the consequence of interactions between genetic and environmental factors, so far, it is not known which genes are involved in the pathogenesis of these malformations. NTD affecting both fetuses in a twin gestation is a rare event. In view of this rarity, we present a case of dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy with spina bifida in both fetuses concordantly. This gestation was preceeded by another dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy that was complicated by placental abruption.",

    "abstract": "Inability to monitor and self-regulate heightened levels of affect lability and affect intensity is associated with a range of mood, anxiety, and personality disorders, psychosomatic symptoms and socially maladaptive behaviors. Despite the importance of these aspects of affective regulation, there are no twin study data to shed light on the genetic and environmental components of these constructs.\nAffective Lability Scale (ALS) and Affect Intensity Measure (AIM) questionnaires were administered to 796 male twins in the Vietnam Era Twin Registry and subjected to twin and model-fitting analyses. Complete data were available from 182 monozygotic and 119 dizygotic twin pairs.\nBiometrical genetic model-fitting estimates indicated that additive genetic influence accounted for 40% of the variance in affect intensity and 25% of the variance in the ALS subscale assessing anxiety-depression mood shifts. Nonadditive genetic influence was indicated for ALS subscales measuring shifts between normal mood and depression (29%) and anger (27%), respectively. There was negligible evidence of shared environmental influence on affect measures. In contrast, estimates of nonshared environmental influences ranged from 52% to 74%.\nFemale were not included in this study due to the nature of the twin cohort. Data from subjects in a population cohort may not generalize to clinical populations. Measures of environment were not included.\nThese results provide evidence for moderate heritability of affect intensity and specific measures of affect lability. Individual differences in mood regulation may represent phenotypic variation in a core psychobiologic vulnerability (e.g., neurotransmitter systems).",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common herpesvirus establishing lifelong persisting infection, which has been implicated in immunosenescence and mortality in the elderly. Little is known about how and when susceptibility to CMV infection is determined. We measured CMV seroprevalence in two genetically informative cohorts. From the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) we selected long-lived sib-pairs (n=844) and their middle-aged offspring and the offspring's partners (n=1452). From the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins (LSADT) 604 (302 pairs) same-sex monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins aged 73-94 years were included (n=302 pairs). Offspring of the long-lived LLS participants had significantly lower seroprevalence of CMV compared to their partners (offspring: 42% vs. partners: 51%, P=0\u00b7003). Of 372 offspring living with a CMV-positive partner, only 58% were infected. The corresponding number for partners was 71% (P<0\u00b7001). In the LSADT, MZ and DZ twins had high and similar CMV-positive concordance rates (MZ: 90% vs. DZ: 88%, P=0\u00b751) suggesting that shared family environment accounts for the similarity within twin pairs. Our findings suggest that susceptibility to CMV infection--even under continuous within-partnership exposure--appears to be more strongly influenced by early-life environment than by genetic factors and adult environment.",

    "abstract": "Advances in modern neuroimaging in combination with behavioral genetics have allowed neuroscientists to investigate how genetic and environmental factors shape human brain structure and function. Estimating the heritability of brain structure and function via twin studies has become one of the major approaches in studying the genetics of the brain. In a classical twin study, heritability is estimated by computing genetic and phenotypic variation based on the similarity of monozygotic and dizygotic twins. However, heritability has traditionally been measured for univariate, scalar traits, and it is challenging to assess the heritability of a spatial process, such as a pattern of neural activity. In this work, we develop a statistical method to estimate phenotypic variance and covariance at each location in a spatial process, which in turn can be used to estimate the heritability of a spatial dataset. The method is based on a dimensionally-reduced model of spatial variation in paired images, in which adjusted least squares estimates can be used to estimate the key model parameters. The advantage of the proposed method compared to conventional methods such as voxelwise or mean-ROI approaches is demonstrated in both a simulation study and a real data study assessing genetic influence on patterns of brain activity in the visual and motor cortices in response to a simple visuomotor task.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine language levels in twins and singletons born after at least 34 weeks gestation and without identifiable neurological abnormality and to evaluate whether in vitro fertilization (IVF) affects language development in twin pregnancies.\nA prospective study of a large cohort of all children born between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2003 was carried out at Gazi University Hospital. All live-born twin pairs in which both twins survived were identified, and a comparable sample of families with pairs of singletons were chosen. The Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale Form and the translated Turkish form of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test were completed at 60 months.\nEven after excluding the most premature twins and those with diagnosable neurological damage, twins performed worse than singletons on language development tests. Twin girls had better scores than twin boys. A statistically significant difference was found between the scores of term and preterm twins. No significant difference was noted when compared according to birth order. Appropriate for gestational age (AGA) twins did better than small for gestational age (SGA) twins in the test scores. All twin girls did not differ from singleton girls, but all twin boys performed worse than singleton boys. Term twins had similar results with term singletons, but preterm twins had lower scores than preterm singletons. SGA singletons had better scores than SGA twins, while AGA twins and singletons did not differ. When the children were compared with regard to method of conception, IVF children had significantly lower scores on the tests than those in the spontaneous conception group.\nIt is hoped that the present findings could lead to a more precise assessment of children for speech impairment and, above all, to more efficient preventive intervention. Whatever mechanisms are involved, the present results indicate that twins born as a result of IVF, are at a disadvantage in terms of language development in comparison with spontaneously conceived twins.",

This is the second ever report of such a case according to the available literature. Unlike the prior case, our patients were 14 months, which is a much younger age than the patients of the previous report. Consequently, our case is better in supporting a genetic origin in the pathogenesis of AC. The findings in our case indicate that early neuroimaging is mandatory in the counterpart of the symptomatic patient with AC, irrespective of the absence of symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal copy number association studies in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using blood DNA have so far been inconclusive. We employed genome-wide screening to look for copy number imbalances (CNIs) between blood and hair DNA from three ALS-discordant monozygotic twin pairs and two phenotypically normal monozygotic twin pairs. Genome-wide chromosomal copy number was estimated using AffyMetrix 6.0 GeneChips. CNIs were sought both between twin pairs and between blood and hair DNA from the same individuals. Two blood CNIs were found in one ALS-discordant twin pair. In another ALS-discordant twin pair, seven hair CNIs were detected. CNIs were also found between blood and hair in three individuals. Imbalances in blood copy number appear to be rare in monozygotic twin pairs, but hair may harbour more CNIs than blood. Copy number differences between blood and hair from the same individuals appear to be common. Since brain and hair share a common ectodermal origin, hair may be a more suitable tissue than blood to estimate somatic copy number variation in the brain.",

The initial characterization of these detected proteins via protein library revealed that their characteristics were similar to those of the glucagon precursor, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), camp-dependent protein kinase inhibitor \u03b1, and anti-metastasis gene (antigen), respectively.\nThere were differentially expressed proteins between monozygotic twins with discordance of congenital esotropic phenotypes and normal children.

    "abstract": "Low birth weight is associated with type 2 diabetes, which to some extent may be mediated via abdominal adiposity and insulin resistance. Fetal growth velocity is high during the third trimester, constituting a potential critical window for organ programming. Intra-pair differences among monozygotic twins are instrumental in determining nongenetic associations between early environment and adult metabolic phenotype.\nOur objective was to investigate the relationship between size at birth and third-trimester growth velocity on adult body composition and glucose metabolism using intra-pair differences in young healthy twins.\nFifty-eight healthy twins (42 monozygotic/16 dizygotic) aged 18-24 yr participated. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. Whole-body fat was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan, whereas abdominal visceral and sc fat (L1-L4) were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Third-trimester growth velocity was determined by repeated ultrasound examinations.\nSize at birth was nongenetically inversely associated with adult visceral and sc fat accumulation but unrelated to adult insulin action. In contrast, fetal growth velocity during third trimester was not associated with adult visceral or sc fat accumulation. Interestingly, third-trimester growth was associated with insulin action in a paradoxical inverse manner.\nAbdominal adiposity including accumulation of both sc and visceral fat may constitute primary nongenetic factors associated with low birth weight and reduced fetal growth before the third trimester. Reduced fetal growth during vs. before the third trimester may define distinct adult trajectories of metabolic and anthropometric characteristics influencing risk of developing type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is a life-threatening injury with a high mortality rate. Most ASDH cases are a result of trauma; nontraumatic causes are relatively rare with an incidence rate of 3% to 5%. We report an unusual series of 2 patients, identical twins, who had nontraumatic subdural hematomas 1 year apart, one at age 15 and the other at age 16. METHODS (CASE PRESENTATIONS): Identical twin brothers presented 1 year and 10 days apart to an academic medical center after incurring confusion, decreased mental functioning, and a subsequent comatose state. The injuries occurred while the patients were playing football, but there was no evidence of traumatic blow to the head in either brother.\nBoth patients had computed tomographic scans and both underwent emergency surgery for hematoma evacuation. Both patients recovered full neurological function and remained healthy 12 years after surgery.\nAcute spontaneous subdural hematoma is an emergent medical condition that may result in rapid neurological decline and must be addressed in a timely fashion. After evacuation of the hematoma, intracranial pressure decreases and cerebral perfusion pressure increases, which may allow normal perfusion of the brain. Consequently, prompt recognition and evacuation of an ASDH can drastically improve prognosis. Rarely, subdural hematoma can occur without head injury and should be in the differential diagnosis of athletes who rapidly become comatose.",

    "abstract": "Chorionicity is one of the main predictors of higher perinatal mortality in twins. The aim of this large population-based study was to analyse stillbirth and neonatal mortality by cause of death and chorionicity and to quantify the risk of stillbirth by gestational age in dichorionic (DC) and monochorionic (MC) twins.\nWe used data on twin maternities delivered in the North of England from 1998 to 2007 and notified to the Northern Survey of Twin and Multiple Pregnancy. Prospective risk of stillbirth by gestational age at death was calculated using number of stillborn fetuses at or beyond a given gestational period per 1000 fetuses in ongoing pregnancies.\nThere were 4565 twin maternities (9130 twins) with an overall twinning rate of 14.9 per 1000 maternities. The overall stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates in twins during 1998-2007 were 18.0/1000 births and 23.0/1000 live births, respectively. Stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates were significantly higher in MC than DC twins: 44.4 versus 12.2 per 1000 births [relative risk (RR): 3.6; 95% CI: 2.6-5.1], and 32.4 versus 21.4 per 1000 live births (RR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.04-2.2), respectively. There was no significant improvement over time in either stillbirth or neonatal mortality rates in either group. The prospective risk of antepartum stillbirth was higher for MC than DC twins at all preterm gestations and the highest risk was before 28 weeks' gestation.\nMC twins have higher rates of stillbirth and neonatal mortality than DC twins, and rates did not improve over 1998-2007. The prospective risk of antepartum stillbirth is much higher for MC twins at all gestational ages.",

    "abstract": "To report a case of conjoined twins conceived through assisted reproduction after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and the transfer of three eight-cell embryos on day 3.\nCase report.\nAssisted reproduction unit of a private hospital.\nA 32-year-old patient underwent ICSI and received three embryos.\nOvarian stimulation and ICSI.\nImages of the embryos and ultrasound images of the fetuses.\nOne embryo measuring 7 weeks, relatively big in size and bizarre in appearance with one heartbeat, was detected on transvaginal ultrasound at 6 weeks, 4 days of pregnancy. Two weeks later, another ultrasound was performed; two fetuses with a common heart were observed. In 10th week of pregnancy, two fetuses with two hearts and an attached thorax were observed. A diagnosis of thoracopagus was made, and the pregnancy was terminated.\nConjoined twins conceived through assisted reproduction are extremely rare. This case, which occurred after transfer of cleavage-stage embryos, suggests that ovulation induction, ICSI, and assisted hatching may also play roles in addition to other factors commonly proposed to be responsible for conjoined twining, such as in vitro culture condition, culture time, and blastocyst-stage transfer.",

    "abstract": "The course of normal heart formation in the embryo has been known for decades, but little is known about the genes that control its development. To further improve our understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in congenital heart disease, we screened for submicroscopic chromosomal aberrations using bacterial artificial chromosome-based array comparative genomic hybridization analysis in two Danish twin pairs, one pair of monozygotic twins with tetralogy of Fallot, and one twin pair of unknown zygosity with pulmonary valve stenosis. We did not find any major chromosome defects, although a number of submicroscopic copy number variations were present. The question of whether these submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances alone or in conjunction with unknown intrauterine factors causes the observed cono-truncal malformations remains unanswered.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether cognitively preserved monozygotic or dizygotic cotwins of persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) exhibit increased brain amyloid accumulation.\nWe performed a cross-sectional carbon-11 labeled 2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole ((11)C)-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET study on 9 monozygotic and 8 dizygotic twin pairs discordant for cognitive impairment as well as on 9 healthy elderly control subjects. (11)C-PiB uptake was analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping and with region of interest analysis with the region-to-cerebellum ratio as a measure of tracer uptake.\nCognitively preserved monozygotic cotwins of cognitively impaired probands had increased cortical (11)C-PiB uptake (117%-121% of control mean) in their temporal and parietal cortices and the posterior cingulate. Cognitively preserved dizygotic subjects did not differ from the controls. Further, the cognitively preserved monozygotic subjects showed similar (11)C-PiB uptake patterns as their cognitively impaired cotwins. The cognitively impaired subjects (monozygotic and dizygotic individuals combined) showed typical Alzheimer-like patterns of (11)C-PiB uptake.\nGenetic factors appear to influence the development of Alzheimer-like \u03b2-amyloid plaque pathology. The dissociation between cognitive impairment and brain \u03b2-amyloidosis in monozygotic twins implies that there may be important environmental/acquired factors that modulate the relationship between brain amyloidosis and neurodegeneration. AD may be detectable in high-risk individuals in its presymptomatic stage with (11)C-PiB PET, but clinical follow-up will be needed to confirm this.",

    "abstract": "Earlier studies have shown variation among experimental attempts to establish whether human monozygotic twins that are genetically identical also have identical individual scents. In none of the cases were the dogs able to distinguish all the individual scents of monozygotic twins living in the same environment if the scents were presented to them separately. Ten specially trained police German Shepherd dogs of three Czech Republic Police Regional Headquarters were used for scent identification in our study. The dogs were supposed to match scents of two monozygotic pairs (5 and 7 years old) and two dizygotic twin pairs (8 and 13 years old). Scents were collected on cotton squares stored in glass jars. Dog handlers were blind to the experiment details. In each trial (line-up), one scent was used as a starting scent and the dog was then sent to determine if any of the 7 presented glass jars contained a matching scent. Scents of children of similar ages were used as distractors. In the matching procedure, the dogs matched correctly the scent of one twin with the other, as well as two scents collected from every single identical and non-identical twin to prove their efficacy and likewise, the presence of the matching twin scent in any given glass jar. All dogs in all trials distinguished correctly the scents of identical as well as non-identical twins. All dogs similarly matched positively two scents collected from the same individuals. Our findings indicated that specially trained German Shepherd dogs are able to distinguish individual scents of identical twins despite the fact that they live in the same environment, eat the same food and even if the scents are not presented to them simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that social contact is related to similarities in weight gain over time. However, no studies have examined this effect in a twin design, in which genetic and other environmental effects can also be estimated.\nWe determined whether the frequency of social contact is associated with similarity in weight change from young adulthood (mean age: 20 y) to middle age (mean age: 41 y) in twins and quantified the percentage of variance in weight change attributable to social contact, genetic factors, and other environmental influences.\nParticipants were 1966 monozygotic and 1529 dizygotic male twin pairs from the Vietnam-Era Twin Registry. Regression models tested whether frequency of social contact and zygosity predicted twin pair similarity in body mass index (BMI) change and weight change. Twin modeling was used to partition the percentage variance attributable to social contact, genetic, and other environmental effects.\nTwins gained an average of 3.99 BMI units, or 13.23 kg (29.11 lb), over 21 y. In regression models, both zygosity (P < 0.001) and degree of social contact (P < 0.02) significantly predicted twin pair similarity in BMI change. In twin modeling, social contact between twins contributed 16% of the variance in BMI change (P < 0.001), whereas genetic factors contributed 42%, with no effect of additional shared environmental factors (1%). Similar results were obtained for weight change.\nFrequency of social contact significantly predicted twin pair similarity in BMI and weight change over 21 y, independent of zygosity and other shared environmental influences.",

    "abstract": "Chronic exertional compartment syndrome and medial tibial stress syndrome are uncommon conditions that affect long-distance runners or players involved in team sports that require extensive running. We report 2 cases of bilateral chronic exertional compartment syndrome, with medial tibial stress syndrome in identical twins diagnosed with the use of a Kodiag monitor (B. Braun Medical, Sheffield, United Kingdom) fulfilling the modified diagnostic criteria for chronic exertional compartment syndrome as described by Pedowitz et al, which includes: (1) pre-exercise compartment pressure level >15 mm Hg; (2) 1 minute post-exercise pressure >30 mm Hg; and (3) 5 minutes post-exercise pressure >20 mm Hg in the presence of clinical features. Both patients were treated with bilateral anterior fasciotomies through minimal incision and deep posterior fasciotomies with tibial periosteal stripping performed through longer anteromedial incisions under direct vision followed by intensive physiotherapy resulting in complete symptomatic recovery. The etiology of chronic exertional compartment syndrome is not fully understood, but it is postulated abnormal increases in intramuscular pressure during exercise impair local perfusion, causing ischemic muscle pain. No familial predisposition has been reported to date. However, some authors have found that no significant difference exists in the relative perfusion, in patients, diagnosed with chronic exertional compartment syndrome. Magnetic resonance images of affected compartments have indicated that the pain is not due to ischemia, but rather from a disproportionate oxygen supply versus demand. We believe this is the first report of chronic exertional compartment syndrome with medial tibial stress syndrome in twins, raising the question of whether there is a genetic predisposition to the causation of these conditions.",

The study population included 237 pregnancies without major abnormalities or prenatal interventions resulting in two live births. We examined the value of DV flow and discordance in NT and CRL in the prediction of discordance in birth weight.\nIn the 237 MC twin pregnancies the median discordance in birth weight was 8.0% (range 0-42.2%). There was no significant association between discordance in either CRL or NT and discordance in birth weight (P=0.116 and P=0.332). In pregnancies with abnormal DV flow in at least one of the fetuses the median discordance in birth weight was higher than in those with normal DV flow in both twins (13.2% vs. 7.8%, P=0.006).\nIn uncomplicated MC twin pregnancies, abnormal DV flow in at least one of the fetuses is associated with a higher discordance in birth weight than in those with normal flow in both fetuses.",

    "abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic disease. Its pathogenesis may involve multiple genetic and nongenetic factors, but its etiology remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that the genome of a patient with MSA would demonstrate copy number variations (CNVs) in the genes or genomic regions of interest. To identify genomic alterations increasing the risk for MSA, we examined a pair of monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for the MSA phenotype and 32 patients with MSA.\nBy whole-genome CNV analysis using a combination of CNV beadchip and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)-based CNV microarrays followed by region-targeting, high-density, custom-made oligonucleotide tiling microarray analysis, we identified disease-specific copy number loss of the (Src homology 2 domain containing)-transforming protein 2 (SHC2) gene in the distal 350-kb subtelomeric region of 19p13.3 in the affected MZ twin and 10 of the 31 patients with MSA but not in 2 independent control populations (p = 1.04 \u00d7 10-8, odds ratio = 89.8, Pearson's chi-square test).\nCopy number loss of SHC2 strongly indicates a causal link to MSA. CNV analysis of phenotypically discordant MZ twins is a powerful tool for identifying disease-predisposing loci. Our results would enable the identification of novel diagnostic measure, therapeutic targets and better understanding of the etiology of MSA.",

    "abstract": "Bone mineral density (BMD), a representative marker of osteoporosis risk, is found to be highly heritable in this Korean study, which is very consistent with the findings in Western populations. This finding strongly supports that genetic factors are significant determinants of osteoporosis risk along with individual biological and behavioral factors.\nAlthough genetic factors are known to contribute significantly to variations in BMD in Western populations, such an association has not been fully evaluated in an Asian population. This study was conducted to determine the role of genetic factors on BMD in Korean population.\nThe study participants were 2,728 men and women consisting of 497 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs, 119 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, and 1,496 first-degree relatives from the Healthy Twin Study. BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Quantitative genetic analysis based on a variance decomposition model was performed.\nAge and the measured covariates accounted for 17~61% of the variation in BMD, depending on the sites of measurement. After accounting for the covariate effects, the heritability of BMD at the whole body, thoracic and lumbar spine, whole ribs, whole pelvis, whole arms, and whole legs were 0.76, 0.72, 0.73, 0.71, 0.51, and 0.75, respectively. The pair-wise correlation of BMD was the highest within MZ twin pairs, followed by DZ twin pairs, sibling pairs, and parents-child pairs. Cross-trait correlation analysis revealed a positive genetic correlation between BMDs at different sites, ranging from 0.80 (arm and leg BMD) to 0.50 (pelvis and arm BMD).\nThe high heritability of BMD in this Korean population similar to those found in Western populations and the significant common genetic basis between BMDs at different sites strongly supports a significant role of genetic determinants on the risk of osteoporosis.",

    "results": "Age and the measured covariates accounted for 17~61% of the variation in BMD, depending on the sites of measurement. After accounting for the covariate effects, the heritability of BMD at the whole body, thoracic and lumbar spine, whole ribs, whole pelvis, whole arms, and whole legs were 0.76, 0.72, 0.73, 0.71, 0.51, and 0.75, respectively. The pair-wise correlation of BMD was the highest within MZ twin pairs, followed by DZ twin pairs, sibling pairs, and parents-child pairs. Cross-trait correlation analysis revealed a positive genetic correlation between BMDs at different sites, ranging from 0.80 (arm and leg BMD) to 0.50 (pelvis and arm BMD).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this pilot study is to asses the effects of multiple pregnancies on the maturation of the developing brain using the polysomnographic EEG recordings. Data from prospectively recorded 10 twin sets, born prematurely (mean 36 gestational week; range 33 - 38 GW) in the Split University Hospital Center, were analysed. We compared sleep architecture parameters in the twins at 37h and 44th postmenstrual age (PMA) with parameters that were expected at that PMA. The same parameters were compared within each twin pair using the Man Whitne test. At first measurement indeterminate sleep (IS) proportion was greater in the first twin than in the second one. The IS sleep proportion was 1.6 fold greater in the first twin (p=0.028), and 1,8 fold less percentage of quite sleep (QS) than the second twin (p=0.054). The length of sleep stages among the twins was similar at the second measurement. Measures of sleep architecture were not significantly different within the twins in second recording. The results of this study obtained on a relatively small number of twins (longer IS and shorter QS in the first twin at the 38th week recordings), showed that the maturational differences among twins exist in utero and shortly after birth, and then disappear until the end of the first month of the postnatal life.",

    "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are cells within a tumor that possess the capacity to self-renew and maintain tumor-initiating capacity through differentiation into the heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that comprise the whole tumor. These tumor-initiating cells could provide a resource for cells that cause tumor recurrence after therapy. Although the cell origin of CSCs remains to be fully elucidated, mounting evidence has demonstrated that Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), induced by different factors, is associated with tumor aggressiveness and metastasis and these cells share molecular characteristics with CSCs, and thus are often called cancer stem-like cells or tumor-initiating cells. The acquisition of an EMT phenotype is a critical process for switching early stage carcinomas into invasive malignancies, which is often associated with the loss of epithelial differentiation and gain of mesenchymal phenotype. Recent studies have demonstrated that EMT plays a critical role not only in tumor metastasis but also in tumor recurrence and that it is tightly linked with the biology of cancer stem-like cells or cancer-initiating cells. Here we will succinctly summarize the state-of-our-knowledge regarding the molecular similarities between cancer stem-like cells or CSCs and EMT-phenotypic cells that are associated with tumor aggressiveness focusing on solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "In vitro fertilisation treatments where multiple embryos are transferred are associated with high multiple birth rates leading to a corresponding high infant morbidity. Here we review the results from a multidisciplinary project which aimed to combine state of the art statistical modelling of routine clinical data with consideration of patient perspectives to explore options for reducing multiple birth incidence by increased use of single embryo transfer (SET). Modelling was based on a large multicentre cohort, supplemented by analysis of HFEA register data. Patient perspectives were explored in qualitative interviews and focus groups. The data confirm the reduction of around one-third in the chance of a live birth for any couple in moving from double embryo transfer (DET) to SET in a fresh cycle. This can be somewhat offset by appropriate patient and cycle selection for SET, with many suggested schemes performing similarly, although many patients perceive such selection as unfair. If we take a complete cycle perspective, and consider the transfer of all good-quality embryos with cryopreservation then it is possible for SET to match or even outperform DET. However, the additional treatment cycles are seen by patients as physically and emotionally burdensome. Such treatments will require optimisation of embryo freezing policies and a number of options are explored.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown strong genetic influence to head circumference (HC), but still little is known on the development of genetic etiology of HC in infancy, especially in non-Caucasian populations. Thus, we decided to analyze the genetics of HC growth in Japanese infants.\nLongitudinal measures of HC were available from birth to 13 months of age in 206 monozygotic and 156 dizygotic complete twin pairs. Genetic modeling for twin data was used.\nWe found only little evidence for sex-specific differences in the genetics of HC and thus analyzed boys and girls together. After 5 months of age the heritability of HC was high, but before that age also a substantial common environmental component was present. Not only strong genetic persistence for HC was found but also a new genetic variation emerged. New environmental variation shared by co-twins affecting HC was found until 3 months of age, and this effect was further transmitted until 1 year of age.\nHC and its growth are strongly genetically regulated. Largely, the same genetic factors affect the variation of HC at different ages, and new genetic variation emerged during the first year of life. Knowledge on the genetic component in the variation of HC may help to design tools for defining abnormal growth of HC in population-based screenings for related disorders.",

Using the method of forced choice, 30 subjects were asked to match the photographs of tongues from twins. Our data indicate that, based on visual assessment, monozygotic twins have highly similar tongues (60% matches); similarly, dizygotic twins were matched 31% of the time, which is a higher probability than would be expected from random selection.

    "abstract": "Postcoital psychological symptoms (PPS) is a virtually unexplored phenomenon in the female population even though women frequently complain about irritability and motiveless crying after intercourse and/or orgasm. The aim of this study was to explore the epidemiology and genetic influences of PPS in a UK population sample of women. 1,489 unselected female twins aged 18-85 completed questions on recent and persistent PPS and potential risk factors. Standard methods of quantitative genetic analysis were used to model latent genetic and environmental factors influencing variation in PPS. For identification of potential risk factors, regression analyses were conducted. Phenotypic variation in PPS was explored using a genetic variance component analysis (VCA) approach. We found 3.7% of women reported suffering from recent PPS and 7.7% from persistent PPS. Relationship satisfaction and experience of abuse were found to be independently associated with recent (OR 4.5, 95% CI 4.13-4.87 and OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.02-1.34, respectively) and persistent PPS (OR 2.53, 95% CI 2.17-2.81 and OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09-1.26, respectively). VCA revealed that phenotypic variance was best explained by an additive genetic (AE) model, ascribing 28% (for recent PPS) and 26% (for persistent PPS) of phenotypic variance to additive genetic effects, with the rest being a result of individual experiences and random measurement error. To our knowledge, this is the first and largest study investigating the epidemiology of PPS. It seems that the most important targets for intervention and prevention occur outside of the family, such as relationship quality and satisfaction, and history of abuse.",

    "abstract": "Craniofacial skeletal dysplasia can lead to different skeletal malocclusions. Both environmental factors and heredity contribute to the formation of malocclusions. There are strong familial tendencies in the development of Angle's Class II and III malocclusions. Cases such as opposite-typed (Class II and III) malocclusions with skeletal and dentoalveolar discordance in siblings or dizygotic (DZ) twins have seldom been reported. We describe the rare case of a pair of opposite-sex DZ twins with completely different skeletal malocclusions, and discuss the clinical considerations for treatment. The patients were twins aged 13 years and 4 months. The girl had mandibular prognathism and a Class III dentoskeletal relationship, whereas the boy had skeletal Class II with mandibular retrusion. Several morphological traits have been implicated with hormonal effect. However, there was no evidence of whether the masculinization effect had any impact on jaw size in the female fetus or whether this effect lasted into adolescence. We suggest that, although DZ twins share the same growth environment, genetic or other unknown extrinsic factors can result in discordance of characteristics of the craniofacial skeleton, dentition, and occlusion.",

Ocular characteristics were evaluated based on fundus photographs using the Wisconsin Grading System and a 5-grade Clinical Age-Related Maculopathy Staging System. We selected twin pairs discordant in each of the following phenotypic categories: Stage of AMD (n = 28), drusen area (n = 60), drusen size (n = 40), and increased pigment area (n = 56). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and linear regression were used to assess associations between behavioral and nutritional characteristics and each phenotype within discordant twin pairs.\nDifferences in smoking and dietary factors within twin pairs discordant for stage of AMD, drusen area, drusen size, and pigment area.\nRepresentative fundus photographs depict the discordant phenotypes. Pack-years of smoking were higher for the twin with the more advanced stage of AMD (P = 0.05). Higher dietary intake of vitamin D was present in the twins with less severe AMD (P = 0.01) and smaller drusen size (P = 0.05) compared with co-twins, adjusted for smoking and age. Dietary intakes of betaine and methionine were significantly higher in the twin with lower stage of AMD (P = 0.009) and smaller drusen area (P = 0.03), respectively.\nThe twin with the more advanced stage of AMD, larger drusen area, drusen size, and pigment area tended to be the heavier smoker. The twin with the earlier stage of AMD, smaller drusen size and area, and less pigment tended to have higher dietary vitamin D, betaine, or methionine intake. Results suggest that behavioral and nutritional factors associated with epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the etiology of AMD, in addition to genetic susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of monozygotic twins (MZ) concordant for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has indicated that genetic factors exert a major influence on the clinical variability (e.g. the number of caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and/or neurofibromas) evident in this disease. Here, we report on a pair of monozygotic, dichorionic twins who are phenotypically discordant with respect to NF1. Whereas DNA sequence analysis indicated somatic mosaicism for the NF1 nonsense mutation, c.4108C>T (p.Q1370X), in the affected twin II/1, this lesion was apparently absent in his unaffected brother. The observation of heterozygosity for flanking SNP and microsatellite markers rendered it most unlikely that the observed mosaicism with normal cells was due to mutation reversion brought about either by gene conversion or mitotic recombination. Instead, we conclude that the twinning event, which would have taken place within three days post-fertilization, must have preceded the c.4108C>T mutation which is therefore predicted to have occurred during the blastocyst stage, leading to somatic mosaicism with normal cells lacking the mutation. This is the first reported case of monozygotic twins discordant for NF1 in whom mosaicism for a postzygotic NF1 gene mutation has been observed in the affected but not the unaffected twin.",

    "abstract": "Processing speed (PS) is one of the basic elements of cognitive functions and has been regarded as a \"common mechanism\" which mediates general cognitive decline in aging. The present study of Australian twins (117 monozygotic pairs, 98 dizygotic pairs, and 42 single twins aged 65 years and over), estimated the genetic influences in five measures of PS: Digit Symbol Coding (DS), Trail Making Test A (TMTA), Stroop color naming and word reading (Stroop), Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Complex Reaction Time (CRT); and their covariation with general cognitive ability (GCA): reasoning, problem-solving, and memory. Additive genetic factors explained 62% of the variance in DS, 42% in TMTA, 57% in Stroop, and 48% and 35% in SRT and CRT, respectively. Quantitative genetic modeling showed that all of the covariation between the five PS measures and GCA could be explained by one common genetic factor, while the covariation between the PS measures was partly explained by non-shared environmental as well as genetic influences. The genetic correlation among the PS measures was strongest for DS and TMTA, and between the PS measures and GCA was strongest for DS. These findings suggest that the different PS measures, as well as GCA were to a large extent influenced by the same set of genes and that the relationship between PS and GCA is entirely due to shared-genetic influences.",

We report on female monozygotic twins with CNS presenting at 7 and 8 weeks of age with anuric renal failure. Both twins were treated by peritoneal dialysis. Renal biopsy proved diffuse mesangial sclerosis. Genetic analysis detected a new heterozygote WT1 mutation R434P in both twins. One child developed a unilateral nephroblastoma. Both twins died because of complications of CNS (sepsis and extensive thrombosis of central venous system/sepsis and sudden heart failure) at ages 23 weeks/13.5 months, respectively. DNA analysis showed the same WT1 mutation in the father, who showed at his age of 41 years no clinical consequences of this mutation and no signs of DDS. In conclusion, we report the third family with monozygotic twins with DDS due to WT1 mutation. The DDS has very rapidly led to end-stage renal failure and death in both twins which is in striking contrast to the manifestation in their father.",

    "abstract": "Hypnosis has been used in the treatment of bulimia nervosa from the early 1980s. Dissociation theory identified a certain subgroup of eating disordered patients with dissociative signs and symptoms. These patients react well to hypnotherapy. Simultaneous hypnosis (\"tandem hypnosis\") in the treatment of two female 19-year-old monozygotic twins led to a very successful outcome after 6 sessions. During the therapy, attempts were made to work through the physical abuse the subjects suffered from their father. Hypnobehavioural methods were used and treatment was combined with five individual sessions. In the cases presented here, the subjects' traumatic history, their high hypnotic susceptibility, and the effectiveness of hypnotherapy seem to support the dissociative mechanism of symptom development. A systemic approach involving the integration of family therapeutical and hypnotherapeutical interventions proved to be useful. The role of these types of hypnotherapy interventions is still undervalued.",

    "abstract": "Animal studies have suggested that angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl4) regulates adiposity through central and peripheral mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum concentration and adipose tissue expression of Angptl4 are associated with obesity-related parameters in humans. Altogether, 75 dizygotic (DZ) and 46 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs were studied, from the FinnTwin12 and FinnTwin16 cohorts. Among the MZ pairs, 21 were discordant for body mass index (BMI) (intra-pair BMI-difference >2.5 kg/m\u00b2, age 23-33 years). Serum Angptl4 (s-Angptl4) levels were measured by ELISA, and adipose tissue gene expression was analyzed by genome-wide transcript profiling. In MZ twin pairs discordant for BMI, s-Angptl4 and adipose tissue ANGPTL4 mRNA (at-ANGPTL4) levels were significantly decreased (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03, respectively) in obese twins as compared with their nonobese cotwins. In all twins, intra-pair differences in s-Angptl4 levels were inversely correlated with intra-pair differences in BMI (r = -0.27, P = 0.003). In individual MZ twins, at-ANGPTL4 expression was inversely correlated with BMI (r = -0.44, P = 0.001) and positively correlated with at-LIPE (r = 0.24, P = 0.01) and at-ABHD5 (r = 0.41, P = 0.005) expression. Our results demonstrated that variation in Angptl4 concentration was only modestly accounted for by genetic factors and suggest a role for Angptl4 in acquired obesity in humans.",

    "abstract": "Valid causal inference is central to progress in theoretical and applied psychology. Although the randomized experiment is widely considered the gold standard for determining whether a given exposure increases the likelihood of some specified outcome, experiments are not always feasible and in some cases can result in biased estimates of causal effects. Alternatively, standard observational approaches are limited by the possibility of confounding, reverse causation, and the nonrandom distribution of exposure (i.e., selection). We describe the counterfactual model of causation and apply it to the challenges of causal inference in observational research, with a particular focus on aging. We argue that the study of twin pairs discordant on exposure, and in particular discordant monozygotic twins, provides a useful analog to the idealized counterfactual design. A review of discordant-twin studies in aging reveals that they are consistent with, but do not unambiguously establish, a causal effect of lifestyle factors on important late-life outcomes. Nonetheless, the existing studies are few in number and have clear limitations that have not always been considered in interpreting their results. It is concluded that twin researchers could make greater use of the discordant-twin design as one approach to strengthen causal inferences in observational research.",

Research examining specific nonshared environments related to adolescent depression remains relatively limited. To address this gap in the published data, we analyzed a sample of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to examine the effects of nonshared environmental variables on adolescent depression.\nWe used the MZ-twin-difference-scores method on data from MZ twins (n = 289 twin pairs) drawn from the Add Health to examine the effect of specific nonshared environments on adolescent depression.\nFindings from the MZ-difference-scores analyses revealed that between-twin differences in maternal disengagement were significantly related to differences in adolescent depression. Additional analyses revealed that the association between adolescent depression and maternal disengagement was largely a child-driven effect.\nCompared with previous research that has implicated maternal socialization in the development of depression among adolescents, the results of the current study revealed that differences in maternal socialization were a response and not a cause of adolescent depression.",

    "abstract": "Flow mediated dilation (FMD) is a surrogate marker of arterial function which can be improved by exercise training. To date, no study has assessed the magnitude of FMD changes in response to exercise training between groups of mono- (MZ) and di-zygotic (DZ) twins. The purpose of this study was therefore to compare FMD in MZ- and DZ twins before and after identical exercise training interventions. At baseline, FMD was assessed using high resolution Duplex ultrasound in 12 twin pairs (6 MZ pairs 13.5 \u00b1 0.8 years, 6 DZ pairs 13.4 \u00b1 0.8 years). Twins completed 8 weeks of exercise training (65-85% HR(max)), consisting of three 45-min sessions per week. Change (\u0394) scores were entered into twin versus twin intraclass correlation analyses by group. Change in %body fat (r = 0.63, P = 0.05) was significantly correlated in the MZ, but not the DZ group (r = 0.31, P = 0.23). Change in FMD was also highly correlated in MZ (r = 0.74, P = 0.02) but not in the DZ group (r = 0.37, P = 0.18). Heritability of \u0394FMD was estimated at 0.74. Exercise induced changes in FMD were similar within sets of monozygotic twins but not dizygotic twins. These data suggest that a significant portion of the arterial function response to exercise training may be genetically determined.",

    "abstract": "Digital patterns of a sample on twins were analyzed to estimate the resemblance between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins and to evaluate the mode of inheritance by the use of maximum likelihood based variance decomposition analysis. MZ twin resemblance of finger pattern types appears to be more pronounced than in DZ twins, which suggests the presence of genetic factors in the forming of fingertip patterns. The most parsimonious model shows twin resemblance in count of all three basic finger patterns on 10 fingers. It has significant dominant genetic variance component across all fingers. In the general model, the dominant genetic variance component proportion is similar for all fingertips (about 60%) and the sibling environmental variance is significantly nonzero, but the proportion between additive and dominant variance components was different. Application of genetic model fitting technique of segregation analyses clearly shows mode of inheritance. A dominant genetic variance component or a specific genetic system modifies the phenotypic expression of the fingertip patterns. The present study provided evidence of strong genetic component in finger pattern types and seems more informative compared to the earlier traditional method of correlation analysis.",

The twin with the more rapid progression to renal failure was born with low birth weight (LBW), suggesting congenital nephron deficiency and increased susceptibility to progressive renal disease, despite having the same genetically inherited kidney condition. This 'natural experiment' adds further credence to the hypothesis that LBW contributes to the susceptibility to chronic kidney disease. We suggest further studies and surveillance for this high-risk group of infants in order to gain additional insights into the impact of perinatal factors such as LBW.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twinning is a unique complication of monochorionic pregnancy. This report describes the clinical findings in two cases of conjoined twins, and discusses their management. One case involved thoracopagus complicating a triplet pregnancy, and the other involved cephalothoracopagus, in which the outcome was intrauterine fetal death due to abruptio placentae after amniocentesis. Recent improvements in ultrasound imaging have facilitated the diagnosis of conjoined twins as early as the first trimester. Although many mothers opt to terminate pregnancy when conjoined twins are diagnosed, a few do not, as in the cases described. In such cases, pregnancy management, including accurate determination of the degree of organ fusion and psychological follow up, are important. On the basis of the two present cases, we present a systematic flow diagram for management of conjoined twin pregnancy from the time of diagnosis until delivery.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies provide insight into the complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We assessed associations between childhood environmental factors and development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in twins.\nQuestionnaires on clinical demographics and exposure to environmental factors were sent to twins with IBD, their healthy co-twins, and their doctors. Kappa statistics were used to examine agreement between twin pairs and odds ratios were calculated by conditional logistic regression.\nIn all, 250 IBD twin pairs (122 CD; 125 UC; 3 CD/UC; 28 concordant pairs) were analyzed. Concordant monozygotic twins with CD showed good agreement for disease location (\u03ba 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45-1.00), disease behavior (\u03ba 1.00; 95% CI: 0.43-1.00), and moderate agreement for age at diagnosis and need for medical and surgical therapy. Concordant monozygotic twins with UC showed good agreement for disease extent (\u03ba 0.60; CI 0.13-1.00) and use of thiopurines (\u03ba 0.73; CI 0.10-1.00). In discordant twins, symptomatic childhood mumps infection (odds ratio [OR], 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2-11.3) and oral contraceptives (OR, 4.0; 1.1-14.2) were associated with CD. Smoking was associated with CD (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.9-9.8) but inversely associated with UC (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9). Both CD and UC twins had suffered more \"gastroenteritis\" and spent more time with animals than their co-twins.\nDisease phenotype in CD and disease extent in UC appeared to be genetically influenced. Smoking is a risk factor for CD but is protective for UC. Early exposure to \"infections\" during childhood may be associated with the development of IBD.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients point to deficits in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits that might include changes in white matter. The contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the various OCD-related changes in brain structures remains to be established.\nWhite matter structures were analyzed in 140 subjects with both diffusion tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry. We studied 20 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) to detect the effects of environmental risk factors for obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptomatology. Furthermore, we compared 28 monozygotic twin pairs concordant for low OCS scores with 23 twin pairs concordant for high OCS scores to detect the effects of genetic risk factors for OC symptomatology.\nDiscordant pair analysis showed that the environmental risk was associated with an increase in dorsolateral-prefrontal white matter. Analysis of concordant pairs showed that the genetic risk was associated with a decrease in inferior frontal white matter. Various white matter tracts showed opposite effects of environmental and genetic risk factors (e.g., right medial frontal, left parietal, and right middle temporal), illustrating the need for designs that separate these classes of risk factors.\nDifferent white matter regions were affected by environmental and genetic risk factors for OC symptomatology, but both classes of risk factors might, in aggregate, create an imbalance between the indirect loop of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical network (to the dorsolateral-prefrontal region)-important for inhibition and switching between behaviors-and the direct loop (involving the inferior frontal region) that contributes to the initiation and continuation of behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of patients' preferences for elective single embryo transfer (eSET) or double embryo transfer (DET) and for singletons or twins is of great importance in counselling for embryo transfer (ET) strategies. In this study, the stability of IVF patients' preferences over time for either a healthy single child or healthy twins was measured and we investigated which factors could explain preference shifts.\nInfertile women (n = 177) who participated in an RCT comparing one cycle eSET with one cycle DET were included. A satisfaction questionnaire was developed to measure patient preferences and attitudes at two moments in time, i.e. at 2 weeks before ET and at 2 weeks following ET, after the results of the pregnancy test. Regression analysis examined the effect of several variables on preference shifts.\nBefore ET, most patients expressed a preference for a singleton, whereas most patients were indifferent 2 weeks after ET, resulting in an overall preference shift towards twins (P = 0.002; n = 145). Overall, 62% of patients showed a preference shift. Preference shifts were explained by patients' global satisfaction of the information given by the fertility clinic staff received by the fertility clinic staff, and an interaction between the occurrence of pregnancy and transfer policy (eSET or DET).\nIn general, patients' preferences for a singleton or twins are not stable during IVF treatment. Possible explanations of a shift in preference are that pregnant patients attuned their preferences to what they expect their pregnancy to result in, whereas non-pregnant patients shifted towards a preference for twins in order to be able to fulfil their ultimate child wish.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to determine if multiple systemic autoimmune diseases (SAID) share gene expression pathways that could provide insights into pathogenic mechanisms common to these disorders.\nRNA microarray analyses (Agilent Human 1A(V2) 20K oligo arrays) were used to quantify gene expression in peripheral blood cells from 20 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for SAID. Six affected probands with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), six with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), eight with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), and their same-gendered unaffected twins, were enrolled. Comparisons were made between discordant twin pairs and these were also each compared to 40 unrelated control subjects (matched 2:1 to each twin by age, gender and ethnicity) using statistical and molecular pathway analyses. Relative quantitative PCR was used to verify independently measures of differential gene expression assessed by microarray analysis.\nProbands and unrelated, matched controls differed significantly in gene expression for 104 probes corresponding to 92 identifiable genes (multiple-comparison adjusted P values < 0.1). Differentially expressed genes involved several overlapping pathways including immune responses (16%), signaling pathways (24%), transcription/translation regulators (26%), and metabolic functions (15%). Interferon (IFN)-response genes (IFI27, OASF, PLSCR1, EIF2AK2, TNFAIP6, and TNFSF10) were up-regulated in probands compared to unrelated controls. Many of the abnormally expressed genes played regulatory roles in multiple cellular pathways. We did not detect any probes expressed differentially in comparisons among the three SAID phenotypes. Similarly, we found no significant differences in gene expression when comparing probands to unaffected twins or unaffected twins to unrelated controls. Gene expression levels for unaffected twins appeared intermediate between that of probands and unrelated controls for 6535 probes (32% of the total probes) as would be expected by chance. By contrast, in unaffected twins intermediate ordering was observed for 84 of the 104 probes (81%) whose expression differed significantly between probands and unrelated controls.\nAlterations in expression of a limited number of genes may influence the dysregulation of numerous, integrated immune response, cell signaling and regulatory pathways that are common to a number of SAID. Gene expression profiles in peripheral blood suggest that for genes in these critical pathways, unaffected twins may be in a transitional or intermediate state of immune dysregulation between twins with SAID and unrelated controls, perhaps predisposing them to the development of SAID given the necessary and sufficient environmental exposures.",

    "abstract": "We present a case of composite tissue transplantation of a latissimus dorsi flap between monozygotic twins. The recipient twin, a 19 year old male, suffered from a complex spinal kyphoscoliosis for which he had undergone multiple previous operations over many years. Soft tissue breakdown on his back causing metalwork exposure had necessitated the removal of his most recent spinal rod. This in turn led to rapid severe deterioration of his spinal deformity and consequent critical impairment of lung function. Robust soft tissue cover was required urgently in order to allow the insertion of a new spinal rod. His previous surgeries and body habitus precluded an adequate autologous reconstruction. Instead, reconstruction using composite tissue transplantation from his identical twin brother was successfully undertaken. We discuss the ethical, psychological and surgical issues involved in this case.",

    "abstract": "By means of large twin cohorts, it has been possible to provide relatively valid and unbiased data regarding the influence of genetic and to some extent epigenetic factors in the aetiology of thyroid autoimmunity. The comparison of concordance rates between monozygotic and dizygotic twins provides irrefutable evidence of a genetic component in the aetiology of both Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, as well as for harbouring thyroid autoantibodies. Biometric modelling shows that approximately 75% of the total phenotypic variance in autoimmune thyroid disease is due to genetic effects. Despite the well known gender difference in the prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease, the analyzes suggest that it is the same set of genes that operate in males and females. The lack of complete phenotypic concordance in monozygotic twin pairs indicates that also environmental and/or epigenetic factors are of importance. The impact of specific environmental and epigenetic exposures can be evaluated by investigating disease discordant twin pairs. Our studies show that skewed X chromosome inactivation is associated with clinically overt AITD but not with the presence of TPOAb in euthyroid individuals. It is now recognized that twin studies offer several features that uniquely enhance our ability to localize genes and understand their function. Future twin studies will incorporate information on genetic and epigenetic variation making it possible to quantify the precise effect of specific susceptibility genes and/or epigenetic variation on estimates of heritability.",

    "abstract": "Despite an emerging consensus that the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for cannabis abuse and dependence are best represented by a single underlying liability, it remains unknown if latent class or hybrid models can better explain the data.\nUsing structured interviews, 7316 adult male and female twins provided complete data on DSM-IV symptoms of cannabis abuse and dependence. Our aim was to derive a parsimonious, best-fitting cannabis use disorder (CUD) phenotype based on DSM-III-R/IV criteria by comparing an array of psychometric models (latent factor analysis, latent class analysis and factor mixture modeling) using full information maximum likelihood ordinal data methods in Mx.\nWe found little evidence to support population heterogeneity since neither latent class nor hybrid factor mixture models provided a consistently good fit to the data. When conditioned on initiation and cannabis use, the endorsement patterns of the abuse, dependence and withdrawal criteria were best explained by two latent factors for males and females. The first was a general CUD factor for which genetic effects explained 53-54% of the variance. A less interpretable second factor included a mix of cross-loading dependence and withdrawal symptoms.\nThis is the first study to compare competing measurement models to derive an empirically determined CUD phenotype. Commensurate with proposed changes to substance use disorders in the DSM-V, our results support an emerging consensus that a single CUD latent factor can more optimally assess the risk or liability underpinning correlated measures of use, abuse, dependence and withdrawal criterion.",

    "abstract": "It is now well established that IUGR is associated with an increased risk of a range of adult onset diseases, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Infants from twin pregnancies are generally born smaller than singletons; therefore, it has been suggested that twins represent a naturally occurring model of IUGR. Although twin gestations contribute significantly to the population burden of preterm birth and small size at birth, whether twins have the same long-term health consequences as IUGR singletons remains unclear. The purpose of this review is to consider what is currently known about the clinical implications of twinning, the differences that exist between the growth and developmental profiles of singleton and twin fetuses, and to use this as a basis for exploring the question of whether fetuses conceived as twins are analogous to IUGR singletons of similar birthweight and gestation. This question is increasingly important in both the clinical and research settings, because the incidence of twinning is increasing and the long-term implications of reduced size at birth are mostly investigated in species which bear multiple offspring.",

    "abstract": "To compare the outcomes of a consecutive case series of monochorionic (MC) monoamniotic (MA) discordant twins treated with umbilical cord occlusion and transection, with those of a cohort of MC diamniotic (DA) twins treated with conventional cord occlusion.\nThis study included 17 MCMA twins (12 true MA and five iatrogenic) treated with cord occlusion and transection and a control group of 72 MCDA discordant twins treated during the same period with cord occlusion in a single center. Duration of surgery, rates of preterm delivery (PTD) or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) < 32 weeks and intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), perinatal outcome and neonatal survival were prospectively recorded in both groups.\nMedian durations of surgery were 28.5 (range, 14.0-74.0) min and 24.0 (3.0-60.0) min in the cord transection and control groups, respectively (P = 0.24). There were no significant differences between cord transection and control groups in the rates of PPROM (35.3% vs. 20.8%, P = 0.22), PTD (41.2% vs. 28.2%, P = 0.29), IUFD (0% vs. 2.8%, P = 1.0) and neonatal survival (76.5% vs. 80.6%, P = 1.0).

    "abstract": "3 sets of monozygotic twins resulting from transfers of single embryos to recipient mares were examined.\nIn all 3 recipient mares with twin pregnancies, only 1 embryonic vesicle was detected before day 25 of gestation. In 1 recipient mare, 2 apparent adjacent vesicles, each containing an embryo with a heartbeat, were visualized on ultrasonographic examination on day 37 of gestation. The other 2 recipient mares underwent ultrasonographic examination on day 30 of gestation, at which time only 1 vesicle and embryo was identified. In these latter 2 recipient mares, however, a thorough ultrasonographic examination for a second conceptus on day 30 had not been performed, as only 1 embryo had been transferred and visualized on early ultrasonographic examination.\nAll twin pregnancies resulted in death of both fetuses. Genetic analysis confirmed that each set of monozygotic twins originated from the transferred embryo.\nMonozygotic twin pregnancy may occur after embryo transfer; thus recipient mares should be examined thoroughly for multiple conceptuses, especially between 25 and 30 days of gestation. At this time, the allantoides of monozygotic twins should be visible ultrasonographically and effective management may still be possible.",

The SGA/AGA group comprised of one SGA twin and its AGA pair (30 pairs). Another group of non-SGA discordant twins was also evaluated (n=40 pairs, AGA/AGA). The morbidity and mortality rates were compared between the groups.\nOf the selected outcome variables, the only ones in which the incidence was significantly lower for SGA neonates than their AGA pairs were respiratory distress syndrome (5 vs. 11, P=0.014), apnea (1 vs. 9, P=0.004) and the need for respiratory support (5 vs. 14, P=0.002). Anemia, erythropoietin therapy and hyperbilirubinemia were significantly higher in the SGA twin. All selected outcome variables had similar rates within the AGA/AGA pairs.\nFGR among premature discordant twin pairs is associated with significantly lower rates of respiratory morbidity and higher anemia and erythropoietin therapy rates. Overall morbidity is similar for discordant non-FGR twin pairs.",

    "abstract": "Previous Danish twin studies have found a highly increased risk of precursors of type 2 diabetes as well as a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes among twins compared with singletons. Likewise, small-scale studies of Danish twins have shown that monozygotic twins have a higher risk of developing precursors of type 2 diabetes compared with dizygotic twins. In the present register-based study, the 10 year period diabetes prevalence in Danish twins is compared with that in a random sample of Danish citizens. Furthermore, the 10 year period prevalence of diabetes in monozygotic twins is compared with that in dizygotic twins.\nThe study population consisted of twins (n\u2009=\u200977,885) identified in the Danish Twin Registry, and a 5% random sample (n\u2009=\u2009215,264) from the birth cohorts 1910-1989. We identified diabetes patients by means of three nationwide Danish health registers.\nThe number of identified diabetes cases among males was 6,677 (6.24%) for singletons vs 2,271 (5.68%) for twins (difference\u2009=\u20090.56% [0.29-0.83%]). The number among females was 6,143 (5.67%) for singletons and 1,722 (4.54%) for twins (difference\u2009=\u20091.13% [0.88-0.38%]). Restriction to various birth cohorts, known zygosity and known type 2 diabetes did not alter the overall conclusions. The difference between monozygotic twins (males, 5.29%; females, 4.40%) and dizygotic twins (males, 5.77%; females, 4.63%) was non-significant.\nDanish twins do not have an increased risk of developing diabetes compared with singletons, and the risk of diabetes among monozygotic twins does not differ from that of dizygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Between 25% and 30% of children and adolescents experience sleep disorders. These disorders are complex phenotypes that are regulated by many genes, the environment, and gene-environment interactions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to sleep behaviors in early childhood and to contribute to the knowledge on appropriate therapeutic approaches, using a twin design.\nData on sleeping behavior were collected from 314 18-month-old twin pairs (127 monozygotic and 187 dizygotic)using a parent-rated questionnaire. We used structural equation modeling to estimate genetic and environmental variance components for different sleep behaviors (cosleeping, sleep duration, and night awakenings).\nShared environment explained almost all (98.3%) of the total variance in cosleeping. Sleep duration was substantially influenced by shared environmental factors (64.1% nocturnal sleep and 61.2% diurnal sleep), with a moderate contribution of additive genetic effects (30.8% and 36.3% for nocturnal and diurnal sleep, respectively). For nocturnal waking episodes, we found a shared environmental contribution of 63.2% and a heritability estimate of 35.3%.\nMost sleep disturbances during early childhood are explained by common shared environmental factors, and behavioral interventions adopted by parents and focused on modifying sleep behavior could contribute to solving sleep disturbances in this age group. However, the influence of genetic factors should not be underestimated, and research in this area could clarify the physiologic architecture of sleeping and contribute to selecting appropriate personalized therapeutic approaches.",

Here, we apply a longitudinal design and re-evaluate cross sectional data in the population-based Swedish Twin Registry (STR) using clinical as well as hospital discharge and cause of death diagnoses. In the longitudinal analyses (based on 46,436 individuals), we identified 542 twins with PD and 65 twins with Parkinsonism. Concordance rates for PD were 11% for monozygotic and 4% for same-sexed dizygotic twin pairs, with a heritability estimate of 34%. Concordance rates for PD or parkinsonism were 13% for monozygotic and 5% for same-sexed dizygotic twin pairs, with a heritability estimate of 40%. In the cross sectional analyses (based on 49,814 individuals), we identified 287 twins with PD and 79 twins with parkinsonism. Concordance rates for PD were 4% for monozygotic and same-sexed dizygotic twin pairs and 0 for opposite-sexed twin pairs. Concordance rates for PD or parkinsonism were somewhat higher but the heritability estimate was nonsignificant. Our longitudinal analyses demonstrate that PD and parkinsonism are modestly heritable.",

    "abstract": "We performed a monozygotic (MZ) cotwin-control study using the MZ twin pair difference in bone mineral density (BMD) to assess the relationship between body composition and BMD at weight-bearing sites. This study controlled for common genetic factors and applied only to environmental factors, using 185 MZ twin pairs aged 30-50 years (140 male subjects, 230 female subjects). As expected, total lean mass (TLM) was greater in males and total fat mass (TFM) was greater in females. In male twins, TLM was associated with BMD at the legs, pelvis, and spine, with percent BMD increases of 0.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.64), 0.62 (95% CI 0.35-0.89), and 0.27 (95% CI 0.01-0.54) for every 1 kg. In female twins, TFM was associated with BMD at the legs and pelvis, with percent BMD increases of 0.10 (95% CI 0.03-0.17) and 0.10 (95% CI 0.02-0.18) for every 1 kg. The results support the hypothesis that skeletal muscle and bone mass in middle-aged men are linked. In contrast, this association was not shown in women, and the impact of TFM on BMD was significant. Therefore, there were sex differences in the relationship of body composition on BMD.",

Compared with eSET, DET ranged from costing an additional \u00a3 27,356 per extra live birth in women commencing treatment aged 32 years, to costing \u00a3 15,539 per extra live birth in 39-year-old women. DET cost \u223c \u00a3 28,300 and \u223c \u00a3 20,300 per additional QALY in women commencing treatment aged 32 and 39 years, respectively.\nConsidering the high twin pregnancy rate associated with DET, coupled with uncertainty surrounding QALY gains, eSET is likely to be the preferred option for most women aged \u2264 36 years. The cost-effectiveness of DET improves with age, and may be considered cost-effective in some groups of older women. The decision may best be considered on a case-by-case basis for women aged 37-39 years.",

    "abstract": "Observation of identical genetic changes in leukemia cells from monozygotic twin pairs has provided evidence for the in utero single clonal origin hypothesis of leukemia, with intraplacental metastasis the basis for concordance. Investigation of this rare mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) cytogenetic abnormality aims to provide further evidence of the genetic changes that underpin this aggressive form of leukemia in infants.\nThe clinical features of a monozygotic infant twin pair with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are reported. Banded chromosomal analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization were used for cytogenetic characterization of the leukemic cells. Immunophenotype was determined by flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the presence of FLT3-D835/I836 and FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations.\nThe twins were seven weeks of age at diagnosis. Both had cytogenetic evidence for the t(1;11)(p32;q23) translocation. Trisomy X was present in a subpopulation of cells in one twin. Immunophenotypic profile at diagnosis was consistent with B precursor ALL (CD19, CD24, CD33 positive, weak CD13 positivity, CD10 negative) and both were negative for FLT3-D835/I836 and FLT3-ITD mutations.\nThis is the first report of monochorionic monozygotic twins harboring the t(1;11)(p32;q23) translocation. Identification of this rare translocation in both twins, indicates a common stem line and provides further evidence for the intrauterine monoclonal origin for infant ALL with concordance explained by the shared circulation. Genetic diversity was observed in a subpopulation of cells from one twin at diagnosis. We must now utilize the sophisticated molecular biology tools available to capture changes at the genome-wide level to gain further insight into the complex events contributing to MLL leukemogenesis in infants.",

    "abstract": "Gestational age specific birthweight has been used as an important indicator to identify the health status of neonates and to provide appropriate neonatal care services to those at high risk. To identify the gestational age specific birthweight of twins born in secondary and tertiary hospitals in Japan and to explore factors affecting mortality, we used a nationwide obstetric database in Japan. Liveborn twins from 2001 to 2005 in the database, which was established with the national Perinatal Health Care Project, were enrolled (n=22,240). Obstetric data from the medical records were collected and analysed. Approximately 60% of liveborn twins were delivered between weeks 33 and 38, most frequently at 36 and 37 weeks. The mean birthweight of liveborn twins was 2084 g and the mean gestational age was 34.9 weeks. Intrauterine growth differed by parity, mode of delivery, birth order, chorionicity and sex. Using logistic regression, lower gestational age, small for gestational age, monochorionic twins and vaginal delivery tended to have higher risks of mortality.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar I disorder is a highly heritable psychiatric illness with undetermined predisposing genetic and environmental risk factors. We examined familial contributions to hippocampal morphology in bipolar disorder, using a population-based twin cohort design.\nWe acquired high-resolution brain MRI scans from 18 adult patients with bipolar I disorder [BPI; mean age 45.6 \u00b1 8.69 (SD); 10 lithium-treated], 14 non-bipolar co-twins, and 32 demographically matched healthy comparison twins. We used three-dimensional radial distance mapping techniques to visualize hippocampal shape differences between groups.\nLithium-treated BPI patients had significantly larger global hippocampal volume compared to both healthy controls (9%) and non-bipolar co-twins (12%), and trend-level larger volumes relative to non-lithium-treated BPI patients (8%). In contrast, hippocampal volumes in non-lithium-treated BPI patients did not differ from those of non-bipolar co-twins and control twins. 3D surface maps revealed thicker hippocampi in lithium-treated BPI probands compared with control twins across the entire anterior-to-posterior extent of the cornu ammonis (CA1 and 2) regions, and the anterior part of the subiculum. Unexpectedly, co-twins also showed significantly thicker hippocampi compared with control twins in regions that partially overlapped those showing effects in the lithium treated BPI probands.\nThese findings suggest that regionally thickened hippocampi in bipolar I disorder may be partly due to familial factors and partly due to lithium-induced neurotrophy, neurogenesis, or neuroprotection. Unlike schizophrenia, hippocampal alterations in co-twins of bipolar I disorder probands are likely to manifest as subtle volume excess rather than deficit, perhaps indicating protective rather than risk effects.",

    "abstract": "A better understanding of the relative effect of genes and environment on craniofacial parameters should improve the possibilities and limitations of the orthodontic treatment and treatment planning. This is especially important for early treatment started in the mixed dentitions that is performed to enhance the dental and skeletal development before the eruption of the permanent dentition.\nThe sample used in this study consisted of lateral cephalograms of eighty-nine pairs of female twins in Beijing. With a mixed longitudinal method, the effective twins were 183 pairs (MZ 110, DZ 73). With the statistical methods of twins, the genetic and environmental effects were analyzed on the position of incisors in female twins from six to twelve years old. SPSS13.0 software package was used for independent-sample t test.\nStatistical comparisons revealed significant environmental effects on 6 positions of incisors (P<0.05), whilst family genetic effects on angle LI-MP were significant (P<0.05).\nAlthough the relatively low inherited proportions of dental variations could be found, genetic effects on incisor position should be carefully treated.

    "abstract": "Over the past decades the prevalence of asthma has increased in most parts of the world, and widespread changes in lifestyle and environment have been postulated as the primary cause for this. We examined whether the extent to which genetic and environmental factors influence susceptibility to asthma has changed between 1994 and 2003.\nTwo different cohorts of twins (n = 3393 and n = 2813 pairs), both 12-20 years of age, from the Danish Twin Registry, participated in questionnaire studies nine years apart. Prevalence of asthma and resemblance between twins for asthma was compared between the two cohorts.\nThe prevalence of asthma increased from 7.1% in 1994 to 10.8% in 2003, p < 0.001. The change was significant both in males (7.7 vs. 12.4%, p < 0.001); and females (6.6 vs. 9.2%, p < 0.001). The best-fitting model, which included additive genetic and non-shared environmental effects, showed that the heritability of asthma increased significantly from 79% in 1994 to 91% in 2003, p = 0.005.\nThis result could indicate that environmental changes over the past years have increased the expression of genes and thus have lead to a higher heritability in the succeeding cohort. This is consistent with the hypothesis that changes in the environment, particular in childhood, are the cause of the increase in the prevalence of asthma over the past decades.",

    "abstract": "Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), a genetic disorder characterized by growth retardation, mental deficiency, dysmorphic face, broad thumbs and large toes, generally affects monozygotic twins concordantly. Thyroid hypoplasia (TH) is a common cause of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and often accompanies dysmorphic syndromes. A pair of female twins were admitted to our neonatology unit 16 hours after delivery. They were born at 35 weeks of gestation. Both twins had an unusual dysmorphic facial appearance with microcephaly, as well as broad short thumbs and large toes. Based on the presence of characteristic dysmorphic features, the twins were diagnosed as RSTS. Thyroid function tests in the first twin revealed the following results: free thyroxine (T4) 8.4 pg/mL, thyrotropin (TSH) 4.62 mIU/L, thyroglobulin (TG) 213.24 ng/mL and a normal level of urinary iodine excretion (UIE). Thyroid function test results in the second twin in the second week were: free T4 5.9 pg/mL, TSH 9.02 mIU/L, TG 204.87 ng/mL, and normal UIE levels. Thyroid volumes were 0.36 mL and 0.31 mL in the first and second twin, respectively. TH was confirmed by technetium 99 m pertechnetate thyroid scans in both infants. Thyroid function tests normalized with L-thyroxine replacement therapy (10 \u03bcg/kg/day) around the end of the 3(rd) week of life. The infants were discharged planning their follow-up by both endocrinology and cardiology units. The rarity of cases of twins with RSTS (concordant) co-existing with CH led us to present this report.",

    "abstract": "Social role function is the capacity to maintain interpersonal relationships and is essential for being independent in the community. Limitations in social role function often coexist with depressive symptoms, suggesting a possible common mechanistic basis. We investigated whether the observed association between these traits is mainly a result of genetic or environmental influences.\nIn 2008, a questionnaire was sent to 745 male twins aged 65 years and older. Our sample included 397 male twins. The number of monozygotic twins was 302, and dizygotic was 95. Among the twin pairs for whom data were available for both twins, 75 twin pairs (150 individuals) were monozygotic and 28 pairs (56 individuals) were dizygotic. Social role function was assessed using the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence. Depressive symptoms were measured by the 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale. Relative importance of genes and environments for the phenotypes was calculated using structural equation analyses.\nOur results show that genetic influence was the major contributor to the relationship between social role function and depressive symptoms, and non-shared environmental influence was important for overall variation in each trait.\nWe concluded that focusing on a non-shared environment is an essential approach for maintaining social role function and psychological well-being. It is suggested that treatments specific to depressive symptoms are more effective than indirect intervention targeting social role function.",

    "abstract": "To assess the influence of smoking, coffee and tea consumption on the risk for bladder pain syndrome (BPS) using the O'Leary Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index (ICSI).\nIn 2005, all twins born between 1959 and 1985 in Sweden (n = 42,852) were invited to participate in a web-based survey to screen for complex diseases, including BPS. Analyses were limited to female twins with information regarding bladder pain symptoms (n = 9349). Women with an ICSI score \u22656 with required nocturia and bladder pain were defined as having BPS symptoms. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Environmental and genetic influences were assessed in co-twin control analysis.\nTea consumption was associated with an increased risk for BPS (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.02-1.55 for low tea consumption; OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.24-2.44 for high tea consumption). Coffee consumption was not a risk factor for BPS (OR 1.1, 95% CI .84-1.45). Former and current smoking was associated with a higher risk of BPS (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.18-1.89; and OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.16-1.92, respectively), but results from co-twin control analysis suggested that the association between smoking and BPS was confounded by familial factors.\nTea and smoking are environmental risk factors for BPS, which are amenable to intervention. The effects of smoking on the risk for BPS may, however, be confounded by familial factors.",

We report the pathologic findings on monozygotic twins, both of whom presented with male pseudohermaphroditism, nephrotic syndrome, and progressed to renal failure and death within the first month of life. Sequence analysis of WT1 demonstrated a G-to-A substitution in exon 8 of the gene (c.1097G > A), resulting in an arginine-to-histidine (R366H) substitution in the second zinc finger domain.

    "abstract": "Hypodontia, agenesis of one or of more teeth, is a common developmental dental anomaly. To date, over 200 candidate genes have been demonstrated to be active in tooth development. The genes Pax9 plays an important role in the initial stage of odontogenesis. Mutations of Pax9 are associated with autosomal dominant forms of oligodontia, the agenesis of more than six teeth and occasionally of premolars (MIM 604625) in humans. The aim of the present study was to screen the candidate gene causing the non syndromic hypodontia, with agenesis of upper third molars and upper lateral incisors, in three couples of twins.\nPeripheral blood samples taken for routine laboratory investigations were used for genotyping. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the buffy coat of 1 ml of EDTA blood samples using phenol-chloroform and the salting out procedure.\nThe insC mutation (nt793, exon4) was observed in the sequencing results by the use of the primers hPAX9ex4F and hPAX9ex4R. InsC raises a frameshift mutation that introduces a nonsense codon so the mRNA activity results impaired.\nIn this work, it is described how the same mutation is responsible for a form of dental agenesis--less severe in the number of missing teeth--leading to hypodontia instead of oligodontia. Therefore, it is possible that mutations of the same gene cause different phenotypes; so we can presume that some modifier genes moderate the effect of the first mutation.",

    "abstract": "A hypothetical mechanism for conjoined twinning postulated by Spencer ([2003] Developmental Malformations and Clinical Implications, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, p 1-476) suggests that, after separation, monovular twins fuse in one of eight predictable homologous sites. The tripus fetal specimen under study embodies characteristics of three types therefore preventing it from classification into a simple variant of any one of the eight twin types described by Spencer. The aim of this study was to reveal internal structural anomalies of the fetal specimen by using magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography. Dorsally appended to the primary twin is a secondary head mass (brain tissue and ocular globe) and two spinal columns converging at T4/T5, suggesting rachipagus twinning. The ventral orientation of the secondary twin's (right lateral) lower limb suggests parapagus twinning. The caudal divergence of the spinal columns and the presence of a secondary hemipelvis, separate from the primary pelvis, suggest cephalopagus twinning. Measurements of the long bones indicate a gestational age of \u223c20-23 weeks. Secondary malformations of the primary fetal body include anencephaly, cleft palate, renal agenesis, decreased left ventricular outflow, and a prematurely terminating descending aorta. This study demonstrates the possibility of using current imaging techniques to study very old, formalin-preserved human material for documentation and scientific discussion without destroying the specimen, thus keeping it intact for posterity.",

    "abstract": "In a monozygotic twin couple with mental retardation (MR), we identified a maternally inherited inversion and a paternally inherited translocation: 46,XY,inv(10)(p11.2q21.2)mat,t(9;18)(p22;q21.1)pat. The maternally inherited inv(10) was a benign variant without any apparent phenotypical implications. The translocation breakpoint at 9p was within a cluster of interferon \u03b1 genes and the 18q21 breakpoint truncated ZBTB7C (zinc finger and BTB containing 7C gene). In addition, analyses with array-CGH revealed a 931 kb maternally inherited deletion on chromosome 8q22 as well as an 875 kb maternally inherited duplication on 5p14. The deletion encompasses the RIM2 (Rab3A-interacting molecule 2), FZD6 (Frizzled homolog 6) and BAALC (Brain and Acute Leukemia Gene, Cytoplasmic) genes and the duplication includes the 5' end of the CDH9 (cadherin 9) gene. Exome sequencing did not reveal any additional mutations that could explain the MR phenotype. The protein products of the above mentioned genes are involved in different aspects of brain development and/or maintenance of the neurons which suggest that accumulation of genetic defects segregating from both parents might be the basis of MR in the twins. This hypothesis was further supported by protein interaction analysis.",

    "abstract": "Elevated striatal dopamine synthesis capacity is thought to be fundamental to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and has also been reported in people at risk of psychosis. It is therefore unclear if striatal hyperdopaminergia is a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia, or a state feature related to the psychosis itself. Relatives of patients with schizophrenia are themselves at increased risk of developing the condition. In this study we examined striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in both members of twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia.\nIn vivo striatal dopamine synthesis capacity was examined using fluorine-18-l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) scans in seven twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia and in a control sample of 10 healthy control twin pairs.\nStriatal 18F-DOPA uptake was not elevated in the unaffected co-twins of patients with schizophrenia (p=0.65) or indeed in the twins with schizophrenia (p=0.89) compared to the control group. Levels of psychotic symptoms were low in the patients with schizophrenia who were in general stable [mean (s.d.) Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total=56.8 (25.5)] whereas the unaffected co-twins were largely asymptomatic.\nStriatal dopamine synthesis capacity is not elevated in symptom-free individuals at genetic risk of schizophrenia, or in well-treated stable patients with chronic schizophrenia. These findings suggest that striatal hyperdopaminergia is not a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have examined differences of civil status of twins and singletons and the conclusions are contradictory. In the present study, based on a linkage between the Danish Twin Register, a random 5% sample of the total Danish population, and administrative register databases, the authors compare rates of marriage and divorce in a sample of 35,975 twins and 81,803 singletons born 1940-1964. Cox-regressions are used in order to control for potential confounders. We find that compared with singletons twins have significantly lower marriage rates: (males: 15-19 years: Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.66 (95%CI: 0.58-0.76); 20-24 years: 0.85 (0.82-0.88); 25 years or more: 0.96 (0.93-0.98) and females: 15-19 years: 0.70 (0.67-0.75); 20-24 years: 0.83 (0.80-0.85); 25 years or more: 0.94 (0.91-0.97)). There is no difference in divorce rates for males, but a significantly lower divorce rate for female twins compared with singletons (HR=0.87, 95%CI: 0.83-0.90). These differences offset each other, thus 57% of both populations remain in their first marriage until censoring. The interpretation may be that since twins have a partner from birth, they do not have the same need for marriage as singletons but have more experience in maintaining a relationship if they do marry.",

    "abstract": "Our aim in this study is to describe the characteristics of sexual development in twins and estimate the role of heritability and environmental factors as causes of certain sexual disorders. Two hundred and ten adult same-sex twin pairs (92 monozygotic [MZ] female, 41 MZ male, 55 dizygotic [DZ] female and 22 DZ male pairs) were involved in the study. Data were collected in 1982 by self-administered questionnaires that included items on sexual maturation, sexual life, contraception, mutual sexual activity within twin pairs and alcohol use. The ratio of married to unmarried twins was nearly the same in MZs and DZs, with the exception that the divorce rate was higher in MZ female twins (14%), and DZ and male twins were slightly more likely to be single. Menarche was later in twins compared to non-twin Hungarian women. 57% of MZs experienced menarche within 3 months of each other, 77% within 6 months while it occurred for 30% and 43% respectively in DZs. The first seminal emission indicated some delay in male twins compared with the Hungarian general population sample. MZ first kisses occurred later than DZ's first kisses. The same was true for the first petting, masturbation and first sexual intercourse. Anorgasmy is 27% heritable but the estimate is not statistically significant. Concordance rate for premature ejaculation in MZs was greater than in DZs but the structural equation model showed significant misfit. Age at menarche appeared to be strongly heritable.",

    "abstract": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder in which patients experience muscular fatigability due to the presence of anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies which inhibit signal transduction across the neuro-muscular junction. Like all complex disorders, disease is caused by an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Although several genes have been identified which appear to be associated with MG, both classic twin studies and current multi-gene models are insufficient to explain either disease pathogenesis or inheritance. We examined the literature on MG to determine both mono- and dizygotic twin concordance rates, and used this data to (1) estimate the proportion of the population with underlying genetic predisposition to MG and the frequency of the environmental component and (2) derive the number of inherited genetic regions that are required to confer predisposition to MG. Using a MZ twin concordance rate of 35.5%, and a dizygotic rate of approximately 4-5% (based on family data), the probability of encountering environmental components necessary to develop MG in an individual with genetic predisposition is approximately 52.4%, making the frequency of predisposition (1:5240) roughly twice the rate of incidence. Furthermore, the number of genetic regions co-inherited between affected individuals is between two and four, which may be large haplotypes with interacting activity. Determining these haplotypes, by fully sequencing associated regions in cases and controls to identify mutations present, may therefore be a practically step toward the understanding of complex disease.",

    "abstract": "Small studies have indicated that twinning increases the risk of oral cleft.\nWe used data from a Danish national population-based cohort study to investigate whether twinning was associated with isolated oral cleft, and to estimate the twin probandwise concordance rate and heritability. Twins (207 affected/130,710) and singletons (7766 affected/4,798,526) born from 1936 through 2004 in Denmark were ascertained by linkage among the Danish Facial Cleft Database, the Danish Twin Registry, and the Civil Registration System. We computed oral cleft prevalence and prevalence proportion ratio for twins versus singletons, stratified for 3 subphenotypes. Probandwise concordance rates and heritability for twins were estimated for 2 phenotypes--cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate (CP).\nThe prevalence of oral cleft was 15.8 per 10,000 twins and 16.6 per 10,000 singletons (prevalence proportion ratio = 0.95; 95% confidence interval = 0.83-1.1). This prevalence was similar for monozygotic and dizygotic twins. The probandwise concordance rate was higher for CL/P for monozygotic twins than for dizygotic twins (50% vs. 8%, respectively). A similar contrast was present for CP. Recurrence risk for both types of clefts was greater in dizygotic twins than in non-twin siblings. Heritability estimates were above 90% for both CL/P and CP.\nNo excess risk of oral cleft could be demonstrated for twins compared with singletons. The concordance rates and heritability estimates for both types of clefts show a strong genetic component.",

    "abstract": "Mothers of multiple births face higher rates of postpartum depression, yet evidence on the marital consequences of multiple births is limited. We examined the association between twin births and parental divorce.\nWe used the 1980 U.S. Census to identify a large sample of mothers with and without twin births. The goal was to estimate multivariate logistic models of the association between birth of twins and divorce adjusting for race, age at marriage and first birth, and college education. We examined whether the association was affected by maternal education, age and sex composition of twins, and family size.\nTwins at first birth were associated with greater parental divorce compared with singletons (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.16; absolute risk 13.7% with twins compared with 12.7%; P=.02). The association was statistically greater among mothers not attending college (14.9% with twins compared with 13.3%; P=.01) compared with those with some college (10.4% with twins compared with 10.5%; P=.34); those with children older than 8 years (15.6% with twins compared with 13.5%; P<.01) compared with younger children (10.6% with twins compared with 10.8%; P=.42); and those with at least one twin girl (13.8% with twins compared with 12.6%; P=.03) compared with twin boys (12.1% with twins compared with 12.5%, P=.38). Mothers with four or more children had a larger association between birth of twins and divorce (15.4% for mothers with twins at fourth birth compared with 11.3% for all other mothers with four or more children; P<.01) compared with mothers with twins at first birth (13.7% for twins at first birth compared with 12.7%; P=.02).\nHealth consequences of twin births for children and mothers are well known. Twin births may be associated with longer-term parental divorce. Specific groups, namely mothers not completing college and mothers who already have more children, may be at higher risk.\nII.",

    "abstract": "To examine the effect of assisted reproductive technology on the stability of DNA methylation at differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in twins conceived by IVF.\nProspective clinical observational study.\nIVF center, university-affiliated teaching hospital.\nFifty-nine pairs of twins were recruited, including 29 pairs conceived through IVF and 30 pairs of naturally conceived twins.\nCollection of umbilical cord blood samples.\nDNA was extracted from umbilical cord blood. Two maternally methylated regions (KvDMR1 and PEG1) and one paternally methylated region (H19/IGF2 DMR) were analyzed using bisulfite-based technologies.\nAlthough H19/IGF2 DMR and KvDMR1 showed slightly more variable levels of methylation in IVF cases than in spontaneous cases, methylation indices did not reveal significant differences at three DMRs between IVF-conceived and naturally conceived twins.\nOur results suggest no significant increase in imprint variability at these DMRs, but the greater variance in the IVF twins has a biologically meaningful consequence and may be a topic for future investigation. Large cohorts are needed to systematically assess the potential epigenetic risk in twins conceived with IVF.",

    "abstract": "The relative importance of genetic and environmental factors for the occurrence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is poorly understood.\nTo (1) estimate the prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI), overactive bladder (OAB), and other LUTS and (2) to assess the heritability of these symptoms.\nCross-sectional survey of LUTS in a national population-based cohort of Swedish twins 20-46 yr of age (n=42 582) from the Swedish Twin Registry.\nPrevalence rates were determined and heritability of LUTS (in female twins) was assessed using indicators of twin similarity.\nA total of 25 364 twins completed the questionnaire (response rate: 59.6%). LUTS were more common in women (UI: 7%; OAB: 9%; nocturia: 61%; micturition frequency: 18%) than in men (UI: 1%; OAB: 5%; nocturia: 40%; micturition frequency: 11%), and prevalence increased with age. The strongest genetic effects were observed for UI, frequency, and nocturia. The lowest estimate for genetic effects was observed for OAB where environmental effects dominated, and more specifically shared family environment accounted for a third or more of the total variation. For stress UI, a fifth of the total variation in susceptibility to the disorder could be attributed to shared environment. Nonshared environmental effects were seen in the range of 45-65% for the various LUTS. The prevalence of LUTS was low in the men, and there were too few male cases to compute measures of similarity or heritability estimates.\nThis study provides robust evidence of a genetic influence for susceptibility to UI, frequency, and nocturia in women. In contrast, shared environmental factors seem more important for the predisposition to develop OAB, which may reflect familial patterns such as learning from parental behaviours.",

    "abstract": "In singletons, neonatal small-for-gestational age (SGA) status is an unfavorable postpartum outcome leading to cesarean section (CS) and increasing the possibility of maternal operative complications. Perinatal characteristics of SGA newborns in dichorionic (DC) twins were investigated for the prognostic impact on their mothers.\nA retrospective study was performed from 2004 to 2009 on 329 DC twins with two live births. Neonates were classified as SGA if they weighed less than the 10th percentile at birth according to Japanese singleton norms. Statistical differences between DC twins delivering appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA)/AGA pairs (control group) and AGA/SGA, SGA/AGA or SGA/SGA pairs (the first/second twins) were analyzed.\nThe median (range) of the gestational ages at delivery for AGA/AGA, AGA/SGA, SGA/AGA and SGA/SGA pairs were 37.1 (27.1-40.3), 37.2 (29.0-40.9), 37.1 (28.1-40.7) and 37.3 (33.3-40.4) weeks, and the complete vaginal delivery rates of both fetuses were 66.2% (43/65), 84.8% (28/33), 82.4% (14/17) and 70.0% (7/10), respectively. Compared with AGA/AGA pairs, AGA/SGA pairs showed a higher incidence of spontaneous vaginal births of both fetuses (31.3% [26/83] vs 19.9% [37/186], OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.45-4.73) and a lower incidence of emergent CS (25.3% [21/83] vs 38.7% [72/186], OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30-0.95).\nThe relatively small size of SGA fetuses allows both fetuses to remain inside the uterus for a longer time and to easily pass through the maternal parturient canal for complete vaginal delivery. Neonatal SGA status is a favorable factor for avoiding operative complications of CS and optimizing maternal perinatal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Genetic individuality is the foundation of personalized medicine, yet its determinants are currently poorly understood. One issue is the difference between monozygotic twins that are assumed identical and have been extensively used in genetic studies for decades. Here, we report genome-wide alterations in two nuclear families each with a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia evaluated by the Affymetrix 6.0 human SNP array. The data analysis includes characterization of copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). The results have identified genomic differences between twin pairs and a set of new provisional schizophrenia genes. Samples were found to have between 35 and 65 CNVs per individual. The majority of CNVs (~80%) represented gains. In addition, ~10% of the CNVs were de novo (not present in parents), of these, 30% arose during parental meiosis and 70% arose during developmental mitosis. We also observed SNPs in the twins that were absent from both parents. These constituted 0.12% of all SNPs seen in the twins. In 65% of cases these SNPs arose during meiosis compared to 35% during mitosis. The developmental mitotic origin of most CNVs that may lead to MZ twin discordance may also cause tissue differences within individuals during a single pregnancy and generate a high frequency of mosaics in the population. The results argue for enduring genome-wide changes during cellular transmission, often ignored in most genetic analyses.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to examine the relationship between inflammation and coronary microvascular function in asymptomatic individuals using positron emission tomography (PET) and assessment of coronary flow reserve (CFR).\nCoronary microvascular dysfunction is an early precursor of coronary artery disease (CAD) thought to result from endothelial cell activation and inflammation, but data are limited.\nWe examined 268 asymptomatic male monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Plasma biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial cell activation included C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, white blood cell count (WBC), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Blood flow quantitation was obtained with [\u00b9\u00b3N] ammonia PET at rest and after adenosine stress. CFR was measured as the ratio of maximum flow to baseline flow at rest; abnormal CFR was defined as a ratio < 2.5. A summed stress score for visible perfusion defects was calculated.\nIn within-pair analyses, all biomarkers, except VCAM-1, were higher in twins with lower CFR than their brothers with higher CFR (p < 0.05). This was observed in the entire sample, as well as within pairs discordant for a CFR of <2.5. Associations persisted after adjusting for summed stress score and CAD risk factors. In contrast no biomarker, except IL-6, was related to the summed stress score of visible defects.\nEven in asymptomatic subjects, a decrease in coronary microvascular function is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response, independent of CAD risk factors. Our results, using a controlled twin design, highlight the importance of coronary microvascular function in the early phases of CAD.",

    "abstract": "Replicate experiments are often difficult to find in evolutionary biology, as this field is inherently an historical science. However, viruses, bacteria and phages provide opportunities to study evolution in both natural and experimental contexts, due to their accelerated rates of evolution and short generation times. Here we investigate HIV-1 evolution by using a natural model represented by monozygotic twins infected synchronically at birth with an HIV-1 population from a shared blood transfusion source. We explore the evolutionary processes and population dynamics that shape viral diversity of HIV in these monozygotic twins.\nDespite the identical host genetic backdrop of monozygotic twins and the identical source and timing of the HIV-1 inoculation, the resulting HIV populations differed in genetic diversity, growth rate, recombination rate, and selection pressure between the two infected twins.\nOur study shows that the outcome of evolution is strikingly different between these two \"replicates\" of viral evolution. Given the identical starting points at infection, our results support the impact of random epigenetic selection in early infection dynamics. Our data also emphasize the need for a better understanding of the impact of host-virus interactions in viral evolution.",

    "abstract": "We report on the pre- and postnatal cytogenetic, molecular genetic and clinical findings in monochorionic-diamniotic twins discordant for trisomy 18. Structural anomalies were identified in one of the twins on prenatal ultrasound examination at 20 weeks' gestation and sampling of amniotic fluid from both sacs was performed for karyotyping. This revealed trisomy 18 in the twin with abnormalities and a normal karyotype in the other twin. Elective Cesarean section was performed at 31 + 5 weeks and the aneuploid twin died shortly after delivery. The surviving twin showed low-grade mosaicism for trisomy 18 on postnatal analysis but has shown normal development. For prenatal diagnosis in monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancy the sampling of both amniotic sacs is recommended, especially if one twin has structural anomalies on ultrasound scan.",

    "abstract": "Within-pair comparison of monozygotic (MZ) twins provides an ideal model for studying factors that regulate epigenetic profile, by controlling for genetic variation. Previous reports have demonstrated epigenetic variability within MZ pairs, but the contribution of early life exposures to this variation remains unclear. As epigenetic marks govern gene expression, we have used gene expression discordance as a proxy measure of epigenetic discordance in MZ twins at birth in two cell types. We found strong evidence of expression discordance at birth in both cell types and some evidence for higher discordance in twin pairs with separate placentas. Genes previously defined as being involved in response to the external environment showed the most variable expression within pairs, independent of cell type, supporting the idea that even slight differences in intrauterine environment can influence expression profile. Focusing on birthweight, previously identified as a predisposing factor for cardiovascular, metabolic and other complex diseases, and using a statistical model that estimated association based on within-pair variation of expression and birthweight, we found some association between birthweight and expression of genes involved in metabolism and cardiovascular function. This study is the first to examine expression discordance in newborn twins. It provides evidence of a link between birthweight and activity of specific cellular pathways and, as evidence points to gene expression profiles being maintained through cell division by epigenetic factors, provides a plausible biological mechanism for the previously described link between low birthweight and increased risk of later complex disease.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown an association between oxidative stress and various diseases in humans including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease. To what extents this damage is determined by genetic and environmental factors is unknown. In a classical twin study with 198 elderly twins we examined the contributions of genetic versus environmental factors to nucleic acid oxidation and lipid peroxidation. Urinary excretion of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGuo), and dinor,dihydro F\u2082-isoprostane metabolites (F\u2082-IsoP-M) was measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The environmental influence on nucleic acid oxidation and lipid peroxidation was predominant, leaving only little influence from genetic factors, as evidenced by no differences in intraclass correlations between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, neither for 8-oxodG (r(MZ)=0.55, r(DZ)=0.47; P=0.43), F(2)-IsoP-M (r(MZ)=0.33, r(DZ)=0.22; P=0.42), nor 8-oxoGuo (r(MZ)=0.45, r(DZ)=0.58; P=0.21). Accordingly, heritability estimates for the three markers of oxidative damage were low (h\u00b2=0.17-0.22). The three urinary markers of oxidative stress were closely correlated (r=0.60-0.84). In conclusion, we demonstrated in a large population of elderly Danish twins that \"whole-body\" oxidative damage to nucleic acids and lipids is predominantly determined by potentially modifiable nongenetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder with high penetrance but extreme variability of expression. Monozygotic (MZ) twins with NF1 who have phenotypic discordances are a useful tool in evaluating which traits are influenced by non-hereditary influences such as second hit somatic events, environmental agents, epigenetic modification, or post-zygotic mutations. We evaluated nine sets of MZ twins and one set of MZ triplets, ages 4-18 years, for NF1 features and calculated probandwise concordance (P(C)) for each feature. MZ twins were highly concordant in numbers of caf\u00e9-au-lait spots (P(C) = 0.89) and cutaneous neurofibromas. IQ scores were within 10 points for all twin pairs tested, and similar patterns of learning disabilities and speech disorders were observed. Twin pairs showed significant discordance for tumors, particularly plexiform neurofibromas (P(C) = 0.40) and malignant peripheral nerves sheath tumors (MPNST), as expected if post-natal second-hit events were contributing to these features. One set of twins was concordant for multiple, large paraspinal neurofibromas, suggesting that there may be more hereditary factors involved in production of paraspinal neurofibromas. Four sets were concordant for pectus deformities of the chest (P(C) = 0.80). Three sets of twins were discordant for scoliosis (P(C) = 0.40); an additional set was concordant for scoliosis but differed in presence of dystrophic features and need for surgery. Our data suggest there are additional non-hereditary factors modifying the NF1 phenotype and causing discordancies between MZ twins. Future studies may focus on differences in epigenetic changes or somatic mosaicism which have been documented for other disease genes in MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "Cortical development and folding seems to be under environmental as well as genetic control. The aim of our study was to estimate the genetic influence on gyrification and cortical volumes, comparing prefrontal gyrification index (GI) in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, and unrelated pairs. Twenty-four subjects (6 pairs of MZ and 6 pairs of DZ twins) were included in this study. Prefrontal cortical folding (gyrification) was measured by an automated and manual version of the gyrification index (A-GI, M-GI) according to previously published protocols. MR-imaging was performed and 3 representative slices were selected from coronar MR-imaging scans. The volumes of the total brain, temporal lobes, prefrontal lobes, and cerebellum were analyzed, too. To evaluate similarity in GI, absolute differences in GI, and brain volumes as well as intraclass correlations of twin pairs were compared with regard to twin status. Finally, a control group of unrelated pairs was assembled from the first two study groups and analyzed. Compared to unrelated pairs, twin pairs exhibited more similarity concerning different brain volumes and a trend to more similarity concerning A-GI. MZ twins did not present more similarity concerning GI (automatically and manually measured) and volume measurements compared to DZ twins. Different factors, like intrauterine factors, postnatal development conditions, and especially environmental factors might account for the differences between related and unrelated pairs. The nonexistence of a pronounced similarity in MZ twins compared to DZ twins concerning prefrontal GI raises questions about the extent of genetic influence on GI.",

    "abstract": "Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps, mucocutaneous pigmentation and increased predisposition to neoplasms. Endocrine manifestations in PJS include gynecomastia and advanced bone age due to estrogen production by large-cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumors (LSCT). We present two 9-year-old male monozygotic twins, with PJS, bilateral progressive prepubertal gynecomastia and testicular bilateral multifocal calcifications, suggesting a diagnosis of LSCT. Their father had PJS but no history of gynecomastia or testicular calcifications. No mutations were found in the tumor suppressor gene LKB1/STK11, which is responsible for about 60% of PJS cases. The genotype of the aromatase cytochrome P450 19, a key enzyme involved in estrogen biosynthesis, was the same in the father and his twins. To reduce gynecomastia and delay skeletal maturation, the children started treatment with anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor. Growth velocity decreased and gynecomastia diminished. After 2 years of treatment, anastrozole is still currently used at a dosage of 1 mg once daily with no side effects. In this study, a couple of monozygotic twins with PJS, prepubertal gynecomastia and LSCT is reported for the first time and anastrozole appears to be an efficacious medical treatment, as an alternative to orchidectomy, to control the effects of estrogen excess.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to examine if parental antipathy and neglect during childhood were associated with obesity in adulthood. From the Danish Twin Registry (DTR) 146 adult same-sexed twin pairs discordant for BMI were identified. Criteria for being discordant were that one of the twins should have a BMI between 20 and 25 kg/m(2) (normal weight) and the co-twin a BMI \u226530 kg/m\u00b2 (obesity). In total 236 out of 289 (81.7%) eligible twin individuals participated in an interview and a physical examination. A part of the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse, the parental care and neglect questionnaire, by Bifulco et al., was used to assess perceived parental antipathy and neglect. Data were analyzed by means of intrapair comparisons. Our results showed that recalled maternal antipathy (P = 0.04) and maternal neglect (P = 0.01) were both associated with adult obesity. Paternal neglect and antipathy were not related with adult obesity. The study demonstrates that experience in childhood maternal antipathy and neglect may contribute to the development of obesity at age 20 and later in adulthood.",

    "abstract": "The association of smoking and depression is established, but it remains unclear which depression dimensions are linked to smoking patterns.\nThe associations between smoking and depression dimensions were investigated among 4,980 male and 5,997 female Finnish twins. Longitudinal cigarette smoking patterns in 1975-1981 included multiple categories describing consistency and change. Depression was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) in 1990. Preexisting depressed mood was screened with the life satisfaction scale strongly correlated with BDI. The BDI dimensions were negative attitudes toward self (NATS), performance impairment (PI), and weight loss (WL). Multiple logistic regressions and conditional logistic regressions for discordant twin pairs were conducted.\nControlling for confounders, two smoking patterns predicted all later depression dimensions. The NATS dimension showed a significant Sex \u00d7 Smoking interaction: the associations of persistent smoking (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.3-2.0; p < .001) and inconsistent former (current in 1975 and former in 1981) smoking (1.6, 1.2-2.2; p = .001) with NATS remained significant among men only. Independently of gender, inconsistent former smoking predicted PI (1.2, 1.0-1.5; p = .04) and persistent smoking predicted WL (1.5, 1.3-1.8; p < .001). Consistent former smokers (former smokers in 1975 and 1981) had no elevated risk for any dimensions. Controlling for familial confounding, the association of persistent smoking with later NATS was replicated among discordant twin pairs (1.6, 1.1-2.2; p = .006).\nPersistent smoking and inconsistent former smoking predict all depression dimensions, although such associations with the NATS dimension are independent among men only. Long-term abstinence (consistent former smoking) does not predict risk for any depression dimensions.",

Controlling for familial confounding, the association of persistent smoking with later NATS was replicated among discordant twin pairs (1.6, 1.1-2.2; p = .006).",

    "abstract": "In France, global rate of caesarian section in twin pregnancies has been 50.2% in 2003. Modes of delivery according to different twin presentations remain controversial in the literature. The purpose of our study is to analyze our practice of twin deliveries in a 5-year period, with neonatal outcomes.\nAmong 22,243 women having delivered in our maternity (22 weeks and over) during the study period, the study population consisted of 371 twin pregnancies, of which 305 after 33 weeks gestation.\nDifferent presentations were relatively identical whatever the gestational age of pregnancies: the \"cephalic-cephalic\" presentation represented 60 to 70% of the total, the \"cephalic-breech\" presentation approximately 10% while the \"breech-cephalic\" or \"breech-breech\" presentations approximately 8% each. Mean terms of pregnancies were 35.2 \u00b1 2.8 weeks, mean birthweight being 2243 \u00b1 561 g. C-section rate was 53.5%. When the first twin was in cephalic presentation, C-section rate was 40% while it was almost 100% when the first twin was in breech or \"other\" presentations.\nThere were no significant differences in neonatal outcomes (mean birthweights, Apgar scores, transfers in neonatology, perinatal deaths) according to different mode of deliveries (vaginal or C-sections). Our policy of planned cesarean section may need to be revised.",

    "abstract": "Malaria during first few months of life may be due to transplacental transfer of parasitized maternal erythrocytes. The most common clinical features of congenital malaria are fever, anaemia and splenomegaly. Other signs and symptoms include hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, regurgitation, loose stools, and poor feeding. A 28 year old woman (G2P1A), with 36 weeks gestation, reported to a health facility in Sunyani on 22(nd) February 2009 with history of labour pains, without fever. According to the mother, even though she did not sleep in insecticide treated bed net during her pregnancy, she took all the recommended drugs of sulfadoxine/ pyrimethamine-intermittent preventive treatment for malaria. She delivered twins on the same day. The mother and the twins developed fever on the same day. A laboratory investigation on the three of them was positive for malaria parasites. The three were successfully treated with quinine. Congenital malaria is real and it is therefore recommended that babies born to mothers with malaria should be screened for congenital malaria.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiota harbors three main groups of H(2)-consuming microbes: methanogens including the dominant archaeon, Methanobrevibacter smithii, a polyphyletic group of acetogens, and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Defining their roles in the gut is important for understanding how hydrogen metabolism affects the efficiency of fermentation of dietary components. We quantified methanogens in fecal samples from 40 healthy adult female monozygotic (MZ) and 28 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, analyzed bacterial 16S rRNA datasets generated from their fecal samples to identify taxa that co-occur with methanogens, sequenced the genomes of 20 M. smithii strains isolated from families of MZ and DZ twins, and performed RNA-Seq of a subset of strains to identify their responses to varied formate concentrations. The concordance rate for methanogen carriage was significantly higher for MZ versus DZ twin pairs. Co-occurrence analysis revealed 22 bacterial species-level taxa positively correlated with methanogens: all but two were members of the Clostridiales, with several being, or related to, known hydrogen-producing and -consuming bacteria. The M. smithii pan-genome contains 987 genes conserved in all strains, and 1,860 variably represented genes. Strains from MZ and DZ twin pairs had a similar degree of shared genes and SNPs, and were significantly more similar than strains isolated from mothers or members of other families. The 101 adhesin-like proteins (ALPs) in the pan-genome (45 \u00b1 6 per strain) exhibit strain-specific differences in expression and responsiveness to formate. We hypothesize that M. smithii strains use their different repertoires of ALPs to create diversity in their metabolic niches, by allowing them to establish syntrophic relationships with bacterial partners with differing metabolic capabilities and patterns of co-occurrence.",

We studied 100 women with twin pregnancies. The correlation tests of 36 discordant twins (15 monochorionic, 21 dichorionic) showed correlation between insulin-like growth factor-1 difference and birthweight discordance (insulin-like growth factor-1 vs. birthweight of first twin, r = +0.915, at 0.01 level, IGF-1 vs birthweight of second twin r = +0.790, at 0.01 level). In 49 monochorionic twins, independent of discordance, there was a correlation between birthweight discordance and insulin-like growth factor-1 difference (r = .538, at the 0.01 level). This correlation was not significant in dichorionic twins, r = .144, p = .01. These data suggest that growth discordances of twins exposed to the same maternal environment may be due to variations in IGF-1, depending upon the genetic similarity.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to determine the perinatal outcome of first- and second-born twins compared to singletons, born at the same gestational age. To that end we conducted a case-control study in Flanders (Northern Belgium). During a 10-year period (01.01.1999-31.12.2008), the entire twin population - 11,154 first- and 11,118 second-born twins (cases) - was compared to 22,228 singletons (controls) with respect to fetal and neonatal (0-27 days) mortality. Only case and control infants of \u2265 500 grams were included, which explained the unequal number of first- and second-born twins. Mothers and their infants of cases and of controls were derived from the Flemish perinatal database and were matched for maternal age and parity, gestational age and gender of the offspring. The main outcome measures were fetal and neonatal mortality according to gestational age. The frequency of fetal death was statistically significantly less frequent in preterm born twins than in singletons, except at term where the reverse was seen in second-born twins compared to controls. After adjustment for congenital malformations, the results stayed unchanged. Below 28 weeks gestation, singletons had a significantly lower neonatal mortality rate than twins that persisted after adjustment for congenital malformations: the first-born twin versus singleton OR 1.71 (1.17-2.51) and second-born versus singleton OR 2.09 (1.43-3.05). Between 28 and 32 weeks, the second-born twin showed a survival advantage over the control singleton. Between 32 and 36 6/7 weeks both twins had a significantly higher survival rate than the corresponding singleton controls. However, after adjustment for congenital malformations, the aforementioned differences between 28 and 36 6/7 weeks disappeared. When at term, twins and singletons had a comparable, though very low, neonatal death rate. These results confirm previous published data. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the neonatal death rate was lower for twins between 32 and 36 weeks (from 28 weeks for the second born twin) when compared to a singleton of the same gestational age. After adjusting for congenital malformations, there was no statistical significant difference.",

    "abstract": "Being an identical twin does not necessarily mean having identical perceptions of family functioning, nor of the twin relationship. Using the co-twin control design, the aim of this study was to explore perceptions of family dynamics and the twin relationship in monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant and concordant for Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). It was hypothesized that, as has been found in twins discordant for cerebral palsy, twins without DCD would perceive family functioning as less healthy than would their co-twins with DCD. It was also hypothesized that the twin relationship would be regarded generally as mutually supportive. Questionnaire data on 866 sets of MZ twins aged 6 to 17 years were used to identify seven sets discordant, and two sets concordant for DCD. Quantitative (General Functioning Scale of the Family Assessment Device - FAD), and qualitative (semi-structured interview) measures were used to assess family dynamics and the twin relationship. In discordant sets, six of seven twins without DCD rated family functioning at a less healthy level than did their co-twins with DCD. All twins in the DCD concordant sets rated their family functioning at a healthy level. From the semi-structured interviews, emergent themes included friendship, support, minimal sibling rivalry, and minor difficulties. It was concluded that, overall, the twin relationship was regarded as close and mutually supportive, with an ambivalent polarity between the best and most difficult aspects of being an identical twin. Implications for research, policy and clinical practice are discussed.",

    "abstract": "We explored heritabilities of the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and associations including genetic and environmental correlations between the phenotypes among Korean twins and their families. We analyzed the data of 1,748 participants (835 men, 913 women, 656 individuals of monozygotic twins, 173 individuals of same-sexed dizygotic twins, 919 non-twin family members, age 30-79 years) from the Healthy Twin study. Heritabilities and bivariate analyses were assessed using the SOLAR package software. In the methods of generalized estimation equations, women in the 4th quartile of state and trait scores were 17% and 15%, respectively more likely to be hazardous alcohol users compared to women in the lower three quartiles (P < .05). However, there were no significant associations between these phenotypes in men. After adjusting for age and squared age, the heritability estimates were 0.26 in men and 0.34 in women for the state score; for the trait score, 0.35 in men and 0.31 in women; for the AUDIT score, 0.32 in men and 0.37 in women (P < .001). After adjusting for age and squared age, there was a significant genetic correlation between the trait score and the AUDIT score, and a significant non-genetic correlation between the state score and the AUDIT score in women, while there were no significant genetic or non-genetic correlations between these phenotypes in men. The STAI and AUDIT scores are heritable in Koreans and the relationships between these phenotypes may be inconsistent by sex.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have found inverse associations between intelligence quotient (IQ) and cigarette smoking, but the causal pathways linking IQ with smoking status and nicotine dependence (ND) are not well understood. The aim of this study was to explore the associations between IQ and ND using a genetically informative twin design to detect whether any association is because of shared genetic or environmental factors.\nA population-based twin cohort with IQ measured in adolescence and ND later in life, analysed by classical twin modeling based on linear structural equations.\nSwedish national registry data.\nA total of 5040 male twins born 1951-84.\nIQ was measured at military conscription at a mean age of 18 years. ND was self-reported at the ages of 22-57 years using the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for ND scale (FTND). Both cigarette smoking and Swedish snus use were analysed.\nBoth IQ and ND showed moderate heritability (0.58 and 0.39, respectively). The heritability of ND was similar for cigarette smoking and snus use. The phenotypic correlation between IQ and ND was weak: -0.11 (-0.16, -0.06) for total ND. Bivariate analysis revealed that this correlation was mainly because of genetic factors, but still the genetic correlation between IQ and ND from cigarette smoking was only -0.24.\nNicotine dependence, as measured by the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence, shows moderate heritability in both smokers and snus users but is only weakly associated with intelligence quotient; common genetic factors underlying nicotine dependence and intelligence quotient probably account for little of the observed association between smoking and intelligence quotient.",

    "abstract": "The optimal mode of delivery for twins is undetermined.\nTo review literature regarding the neonatal outcomes following twin delivery.\nSearches were conducted in PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane library and reference lists.\nStudies selection criteria were: both twins alive at labour, outcomes stratified for birth order, presentation, planned and actual delivery mode. Eighteen articles were included in the meta-analysis (39, 571 twin sets).\nThe Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines were followed. Interstudy heterogeneity (I(2) ) was tested. A fixed model was generated whenever I(2)<25%. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI were computed. Intergroup comparison was significant if 95% CI did not encompass 1. The first and second twins were indicated as Twin A (TA) and Twin B (TB), respectively.\nNeonatal morbidity was lower in TA than TB (3.0 versus 4.6%; OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.39-0.70). TA experienced neonatal death less often than TB (0.3 versus 0.6%; OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.38-0.81). No differences were noted between vertex and non-vertex and attempted vaginal delivery versus planned caesarean section in either TA or TB. In TA, neonatal morbidity was lower after vaginal delivery (1.1%) than caesarean section (2.2%; OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.27-0.82). Neonatal death was not associated with actual delivery mode. In TB, morbidity following combined delivery (19.8%) was higher than after vaginal delivery (9.5%; OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.41-0.74) or caesarean section (9.8%; OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.43-0.53). When outcomes were stratified for both presentation and delivery mode, mortality rate was lower after vaginal delivery than caesarean section for both vertex and nonvertex TB. AUTHOR'S CONCLUSION: An attempt at vaginal delivery should be considered in twin pregnancies with vertex/vertex presentation.",

    "abstract": "Several studies reported a negative association between ADHD symptoms and academic achievement. We investigated the etiology of the association between Attention Problems (AP, one of the core symptoms in ADHD) in early childhood and four academic skills across childhood in a genetically informative design.\nAcademic skills (mathematics, spelling, reading and comprehension) were measured with standardized tests performed at school in grade 2, 4, and 6. AP were measured with mother ratings of the Devereux Child Behavior Rating Scale at age 5 and the Child Behavior Checklist at age 7. Subjects were 767 Dutch twins from 445 families.\nAP were negatively associated with most academic skills in each grade, and this association was stable over time. Correlations of AP with mathematics and comprehension were around -0.20, and with spelling around -0.15. Correlations with reading were not significant. A significant genetic correlation (-0.40) between AP and mathematics across time indicated that shared genes play a role for these measures. The genetic correlations of AP with spelling and comprehension (both -0.28, p= 0.09) were non-significant.\nMore complex academic skills, requiring higher cognitive processes, like mathematics and comprehension, are especially negatively associated with attention problems. The association between AP and mathematics is partly due to shared genes, while the association with comprehension, and spelling was driven by unique environmental factors.\n\u00c9tudier l\u2019\u00e9tiologie g\u00e9n\u00e9tique et environnementale de la concomitance des sympt\u00f4mes du TDAH et des difficult\u00e9s de lecture dans le plus vaste \u00e9chantillon \u00e9tudi\u00e9 \u00e0 ce jour, en distinguant deux dimensions dans le TDAH et dans la lecture.\nAnalyse des donn\u00e9es tir\u00e9es de l\u2019\u00e9tude populationnelle Twins Early Development Study portant sur 6 428 paires de jumeaux \u00e2g\u00e9s de 12 ans.

    "abstract": "Our study was undertaken to determine whether caesarean section for the second of cephalic/non-cephalic presenting twins may prevent or diminish neonatal morbidity. For this study, 482 cephalic/non-cephalic presenting twins admitted to our hospital were retrospectively evaluated. They were separated into two groups according to their delivery mode: vaginal or caesarean delivery. Records of Apgar score (<7) at 5 min, seizure occurrence, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and duration, need for mechanical ventilation and perinatal mortality of second twins were compared. Second fetuses' mortality rates of the two groups were similar. NICU admission rate and duration, seizure and mechanical ventilation necessity rates of second fetuses were similar for both groups. Only 5 min Apgar score rates of the vaginal group were lower than the caesarean group. Caesarean section for cephalic/non-cephalic presenting twins does not decrease morbidity scores but provides effective improvement on morbidity of second fetus, according to Apgar scores.",

At presentation, typical components of ARS could be found in both patients, including iris anomaly, maxillary hypoplasia, hypodontia, and umbilical skin fold. Both sisters received trabeculectomy in both the eyes later in our center. Intraocular pressure was well controlled in both the eyes in both patients 1 year after the surgeries. No mutations were found by direct sequencing of PITX2 and FOXC1 genes, in the twin sisters.

    "abstract": "Defective genomic imprinting is often associated with syndromes that include abnormal growth as a clinical phenotype. However, whether differential methylation at imprinted loci also contributes to nonsyndromic abnormal body weight regulation is yet unknown. In this study, we investigated a potential contribution of aberrant DNA methylation at nine differentially methylated regions (DMRs) to the development of nonsyndromic overweight. Sixteen monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for BMI (BMI difference ranging from 2.9-9.5 kg/m(2)) were recruited from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. DNA extracted from saliva samples was bisulfite-treated followed by PCR amplification of target regions in DMRs most representative for abnormal growth syndromes: KvDMR1, H19 CTCF4, H19 CTCF6, IGF2 DMR0, IGF2 DMR2, GRB10, MEST, SNRPN, GNAS XL-\u03b1-s and GNAS Exon1A. At the DMRs analyzed, methylation-dependent primer extension experiments revealed only small intrapair differences in methylation indexes (MI) between the heavy and lean co-twins. In addition, no significant correlations between intrapair BMI differences and intrapair differences in MI were observed. In conclusion, DNA methylation variability at the nine DMRs analyzed does not seem to contribute to the discordancy in BMI observed in these MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "Report of a high dysplastic developmental spondylolisthesis in two identical twins of two unrelated families.\nTo investigate the multifactorial etiology of developmental spondylolisthesis.\nMultiple studies have suggested an association between a high pelvic incidence and the presence of isthmic spondylolisthesis. Other studies suggest a genetic background for spondylolysis and a pattern of inheritance of susceptibility to spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis. Heterozygous cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein-1 (CDMP-1) mutation has previously been associated with spondylolysis and severe spondylolisthesis.\nTwo identical female twins presented with a developmental spondylolisthesis. Pelvic parameters, lumbar lordosis and grade of spondylolisthesis were calculated on a lateral standing spine radiograph. MRI is performed to confirm a high dysplastic developmental spondylolisthesis. Blood sample of these four individuals were analyzed for the presence of a CDMP-1 mutation, a cartilage-specific member of the TGF-b superfamily of secreted signaling molecules that plays a key role in chondrogenesis, growth, and patterning of the developing vertebrate skeleton.\nPI, SS, PT, LL, and SI are significantly greater in all of these patients in comparison with the general population. Spinal MRI confirms a high dysplastic developmental spondylolisthesis in both twins. Mutation analysis of the two coding exons of CDMP-1 did not reveal any mutation in all four individuals.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of a high dysplastic developmental spondylolisthesis in identical twins. The presence of a high dysplastic developmental spondylolisthesis in two identical twins shows the convergence in etiology of different factors such as genetics, maturation, critical age, female sex, high pelvic incidence. Although we cannot confirm that CDMP-1 mutation plays a key role in the etiology of spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis, neither can we rule out that CDMP-1 problems may be an etiology for at least a subpopulation of patients. However, the presence of a developmental spondylolisthesis in two sets of identical twins still suggests a genetic susceptibility to spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have evaluated the incidence of familial vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) among multiple gestation births. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and characteristics of VUR in twins in a large cohort of families with VUR.\nBetween 1998 and 2010, data were collected on 251 families (538 children) with at least 2 siblings who had VUR. The incidence of affected twins among the families was analysed. Data were assessed for age at presentation, gender, grading of VUR, laterality of affectation and renal scarring. VUR was diagnosed by voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans were used to assess renal scarring.\nThere were 12 families (4.8%) in which twins were affected with VUR. There were 12 index cases (7 males/5 females), and 12 siblings (1 male/11 females). All index cases presented with urinary tract infection (UTIs), whereas 2 siblings had UTIs and 10 were screened. All cases presented between 3 months and 2 years. Among the index cases, three had unilateral and nine had bilateral VUR. Among the siblings, four had unilateral and eight had bilateral VUR. Thirty-seven (90%) of the 41 affected renal refluxing units had high-grade VUR. Three index cases had renal scarring. No scarring was seen in the siblings.\nThe vast majority of twins with VUR are females who have high grade VUR and a low incidence of renal scarring. Twins with VUR may represent a genetically different subgroup with female preponderance and severe reflux.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that gene-environmental interactions play crucial roles in the development of allergy, especially in early life. Analysis of twin cases may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of allergy. Though several studies have indicated the importance of a genetic contribution to the expression of allergic diseases based on twin analyses, very few data are available regarding twins with Food Protein-Induced Gastrointestinal Syndrome (FPIGS). Two pairs of identical and fraternal twins with FPIGS are presented.\nThe twins were born with no abnormalities and fed breast milk and supplemental formula. The identical twins developed vomiting and bloody stool simultaneously. The fraternal twins developed prolonged vomiting and loose stools at different times. Since their symptoms disappeared with when formula feeding was stopped, the symptoms were thought to indicate the presence of an allergy to cow's milk. The clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of the four patients were highly suggestive of FPIGS. The identical and fraternal twins showed very similar symptoms, including their onset and clinical courses. However, a substantial clinical disparity existed in the clinical features of the two pairs of twins.\nComparisons of the twins' similarities and disparities suggest a profound genetic effect on the patients' clinical features, along with individual environmental factors. The prevalence of FPIGS is increasing, and it is now a major topic of public concern in Japan. Further accumulation of data on twins with FPIGS is needed to clarify the genetic contributions to this disease.",

    "abstract": "Although the water cycle is only a minor contributor to the energy demand in society, it is a matter of good housekeeping to minimize the energy need within a sustainable water cycle. Wastewater treatment should not only be applied to purify the water, but also recover the energy present in this water, as well as to recover essential elements like nitrogen and phosphorus. From an energy analysis of the Dutch water cycle it is concluded that creating an energy neutral water cycle by using the heat content or by making use of the organic load of wastewater is within hands.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the intracellular calcium concentration govern cytoskeletal rearrangement, mitosis, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation or synaptic transmission, thereby, regulating cellular effector and organ functions. Calcium binding proteins respond to changes in the intracellular calcium concentration with structural changes, triggering enzymatic activation and association with downstream proteins. One type of calcium binding proteins are EF-hand super family proteins. Here, we describe two recently discovered homologous EF-hand containing adaptor proteins, Swiprosin-1/EF-hand domain containing 2 (EFhd2) and Swiprosin-2/EF-hand domain containing 1 (EFhd1), which are related to allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1). For reasons of simplicity and concision we propose to name Swiprosin-1/EFhd2 and Swiprosin-2/EFhd1 from now on EFhd2 and EFhd1, according to their respective gene symbols. AIF-1 and Swiprosin-1/EFhd2 are already present in Bilateria, for instance in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenhorhabditis elegans. Swiprosin-2/EFhd1 arose later from gene duplication in the tetrapodal lineage. Secondary structure prediction of AIF-1 reveals disordered regions and one functional EF-hand. Swiprosin-1/EFhd2 and Swiprosin-2/EFhd1 exhibit a disordered region at the N-terminus, followed by two EF-hands and a coiled-coil domain. Whereas both proteins are similar in their predicted overall structure they differ in a non-homologous stretch of 60 amino acids just in front of the EF-hands. AIF-1 controls calcium-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangement in innate immune cells by means of its functional EF-hand. We propose that Swiprosin-1/EFhd2 as well is a cytoskeleton associated adaptor protein involved in immune and brain cell function. Pro-inflammatory conditions are likely to modulate expression and function of Swiprosin-1/EFhd2. Swiprosin-2/EFhd1, on the other hand, modulates apoptosis and differentiation of neuronal and muscle precursor cells, probably through an association with mitochondria. We suggest furthermore that Swiprosin-2/EFhd1 is part of a cellular response to oxidative stress, which could explain its pro-survival activity in neuronal, muscle and perhaps some malignant tissues.",

    "abstract": "There is a poor association between systemic blood flow and blood pressure in preterm infants in the first days of life. Very preterm babies can have early low systemic blood flow with poor myocardial contractility but normal blood pressure. Superior vena cava flow measured by echocardiography can be used to determine systemic blood flow. Low superior vena cava flow is a risk factor for mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. We report the case of preterm twins with contrasting relationships among systemic blood flow, myocardial contractility and blood pressure. The first twin with normal blood pressure, but low superior vena cava flow and poor myocardial contractility in the first hours of life developed a severe intraventricular haemorrhage and died, despite cardiovascular support. The second twin with low blood pressure but normal superior vena cava flow did not develop adverse outcomes in the first days of life. These cases underline the usefulness of neonatal functional echocardiography in early understanding and management of the preterm infant, and the inaccuracy of other clinical parameters used to assess cardiovascular function.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to assess the moderating effects of the catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) (Val(158/108)Met) genotype on antipsychotic medication-induced changes in the cognitive performance of patients with chronic schizophrenia.\nThe sample consisted of 85 monozygotic and 53 dizygotic twin pairs, of varying concordance for schizophrenia, and healthy control twins. Cognitive ability was measured using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-third edition. We used structural equation modelling to estimate main and interaction effects of the COMT status and antipsychotic medication dose on verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) and performance intelligence quotient scores.\nThere was no evidence of a main or interaction effect of the COMT status or chlorpromazine equivalent dose on the performance intelligence quotient. There were no main effects of COMT or chlorpromazine equivalent dose on VIQ; however, there was evidence of a statistically significant interaction (P<0.01) between the COMT and chlorpromazine equivalents on VIQ. The VIQ performance of val/val individuals was significantly lower with increasing antipsychotic medication dose, up to 12 intelligence quotient points lower than met carriers treated with medication. In the absence of medication, the three genotypes did not significantly differ, whereas at the highest doses (1500), the val/val homozygotes and Met carriers differed by more than one standard deviation.\nOur results show that the verbal abilities of val homozygotes of the COMT gene are cognitively impaired by higher doses of antipsychotic medication. This association is reversed in Met carriers. These data are consistent with an earlier study that found evidence of moderating effects of antipsychotic medication on N-back and verbal fluency tasks.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a complicated disease state that affects patients' quality of life. The first monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) inhibitor for PD, selegiline (Eldepryl), was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996, and rasagiline (Azilect) received FDA approval in 2006. At first, pharmacists may assume that rasagiline is just another me-too drug. There are three areas in which the two medications differ from each other: MAO type A inhibitors are found in high concentrations in the intestines, and MAO type B inhibitors are found mostly in the brain. If MAO-A inhibition occurs, the body cannot protect itself from exogenous amines such as tyramine. The absorbed tyramine can cause hypertensive crisis, also known as the cheese reaction. Selegiline's capsule product labeling includes a bolded warning that it \"should not be used at daily doses exceeding 10 mg per day because of the risks associated with non-selective inhibition of MAO.\" It also says, \"the selectivity of selegiline for MAO B may not be absolute, even at the recommended daily dose.\" The fact that rasagiline has the same effect has been challenged by two main-stream studies. Selegiline is a propargyl amphetamine derivative that undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism to L-methamphetamine and L-amphetamine. Rasagiline's major metabolite is amioindan, which has no amphetaminelike properties. Selegiline has been reviewed looking for neuroprotection, but studies have been unable to come to a definite positive neuroprotection conclusion. Proponents of rasagiline's neuroprotective effects also point to clinical studies in humans that demonstrate delayed and reduced need for future use of levodopa. In summary, selegiline and rasagiline look more and more like distant cousins instead of twins.",

    "abstract": "Today, more than 400 extra-solar planets have been discovered. They provide strong constraints on the structure and formation mechanisms of planetary systems. Despite this huge amount of data, we still have little information concerning the constraints for extra-terrestrial life, i.e. the frequency of Earth twins in the habitable zone and the distribution of their orbital eccentricities. On the other hand, these latter questions strongly excite general interest and trigger future searches for life in the Universe. The status of the extra-solar planets field--in particular with respect to very-low-mass planets--will be discussed and an outlook on the search for Earth twins will be given in this paper.",

We report on 10-week-old monozygotic twins, diagnosed with cystic fibrosis by newborn screening, who developed facial palsy and increased intracranial pressure. Cranial imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis produced normal results. Levels of serum vitamin A were below normal range. Low levels of vitamin A are associated with facial nerve paralysis, and are at least partly implicated in the development of increased intracranial pressure in infants with cystic fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and environmental architecture of psychotic and obsessive symptoms are not completely elucidated. This study estimated for these symptoms (i) the genetic and environmental components, (ii) the within-individual association, and (iii) the extent to which this association originates from common genetic and environmental factors. Young adult twins (N=701) from the population-based Italian Twin Register were assessed for psychotic and obsessive-compulsive symptoms by using the Symptom Check List (SCL-90). Multivariate Cholesky models were fitted by the Mx statistical program. No previous study used this design to examine the same dimensions. The best-fitting model included additive genetic and nonshared environmental components, each accounting for about half of total variance in the symptoms. Genetic influences on the different symptoms overlapped considerably (r(g)=0.81 to 0.99). Phenotypic correlations of psychotic symptoms and of psychotic with obsessive symptoms were high (r=0.61 to 0.76), with 53% to 69% explained by shared genetic effects. This study shows substantial genetic influence on psychotic and obsessive symptoms, and indicates that their co-occurrence may be due to genetic factors to a greater extent than to environmental effects. These results encourage the search for genetic and environmental factors underlying the covariance between different psychotic traits as well as between psychotic and obsessive traits.",

The correlation in fetal NT in each euploid twin pregnancy was estimated.\nThe distribution of NT in both euploid and trisomic fetuses was consistent with the mixture model in singleton pregnancies.

Allowing for this correlation in risk assessment for trisomies had a major impact on the estimated patient-specific risk but had little effect on the overall performance of screening.\nIn dichorionic twin pregnancies, the mixture model of distributions of NT can be applied as in singletons.

    "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role in learning and memory, but its effects on the fiber architecture of the living brain are unknown. We genotyped 455 healthy adult twins and their non-twin siblings (188 males/267 females; age: 23.7\u00b12.1 years, mean\u00b1SD) and scanned them with high angular resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), to assess how the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism affects white matter microstructure. By applying genetic association analysis to every 3D point in the brain images, we found that the Val-BDNF genetic variant was associated with lower white matter integrity in the splenium of the corpus callosum, left optic radiation, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and superior corona radiata. Normal BDNF variation influenced the association between subjects' performance intellectual ability (as measured by Object Assembly subtest) and fiber integrity (as measured by fractional anisotropy; FA) in the callosal splenium, and pons. BDNF gene may affect the intellectual performance by modulating the white matter development. This combination of genetic association analysis and large-scale diffusion imaging directly relates a specific gene to the fiber microstructure of the living brain and to human intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about paternal psychosocial factors and childhood asthma.\nWe sought to examine the link between maternal and paternal psychosocial stress and asthma outcomes in young children.\nParents of 339 pairs of Puerto Rican twins were interviewed individually about their own psychosocial stress and about asthma in their children at age 1 year and again about their child's asthma at age 3 years. Fathers were asked about symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and antisocial behavior. Mothers were asked about depressive symptoms. Outcomes assessed in children included recent asthma symptoms, oral steroid use and hospitalizations for asthma in the prior year, and asthma diagnosis. Generalized estimated equation models were used for the multivariate analysis of parental psychosocial stress and asthma morbidity in childhood.\nAfter multivariable adjustment, paternal PTSD symptoms, depression, and antisocial behavior were each associated with increased asthma symptoms at age 1 year (eg, odds ratio, 1.08 for each 1-point increase in PTSD score; 95% CI, 1.03-1.14). Maternal depressive symptoms were associated with an increased risk of asthma hospitalizations at age 1 year. At age 3 years, maternal depressive symptoms were associated with asthma diagnosis and hospitalizations for asthma (odds ratio for each 1-point increase in symptoms, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.00-1.36). In an analysis combining 1- and 3-year outcomes, paternal depression was associated with oral steroid use, maternal depressive symptoms were associated with asthma hospitalizations and asthma diagnosis, and parental depression was associated with hospitalizations for asthma.\nBoth paternal and maternal psychosocial factors can influence asthma morbidity in young Puerto Rican children.",

We applied an unbiased metagenomic approach to try to identify known or novel infectious agents in the serum of 45 cases with chronic fatigue syndrome or idiopathic chronic fatigue. Controls were the unaffected monozygotic co-twins of cases, and serum samples were obtained at the same place and time.\nNo novel DNA or RNA viral signatures were confidently identified. Four affected twins and no unaffected twins evidenced viremia with GB virus C (8.9% vs. 0%, p = 0.019), and one affected twin had previously undetected hepatitis C viremia. An excess of GB virus C viremia in cases with chronic fatigue requires confirmation.\nCurrent, impairing chronic fatigue was not robustly associated with viremia detectable in serum.",

    "abstract": "Exercise behavior, cardiorespiratory fitness, and obesity are strongly influenced by genetic factors. By studying young adult twins, we examined to what extent these interrelated traits have shared genetic and environmental etiologies. We studied 304 twin individuals selected from the population-based FinnTwin16 study. Physical activity was assessed with the Baecke questionnaire, yielding three indexes: sport index, leisure-time index, and work index. In this study, we focused on sport index, which describes sports participation. Body composition was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and cardiorespiratory fitness using a bicycle ergometer exercise test with gas exchange analysis. The Baecke sport index was associated with high maximal oxygen uptake adjusted for lean body mass (Vo(2max)[adj]) (r = 0.40), with low body fat percentage (BF%) (r = -0.44) and low waist circumference (WC) (r = -0.29). Heritability estimates for the key traits were as follows: 56% for sport index, 71% for Vo(2max)[adj], 77% for body mass index, 66% for WC, and 68% for BF%. The association between sport index and Vo(2max) was mostly explained by genetic factors (70%), as were both the association between sport index and BF% (71%) and that between sport index and WC (59%). Our results suggest that genetic factors explain a considerable part of the associations between sports participation, cardiorespiratory fitness, and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Genetic analysis of diffusion tensor images (DTI) shows great promise in revealing specific genetic variants that affect brain integrity and connectivity. Most genetic studies of DTI analyze voxel-based diffusivity indices in the image space (such as 3D maps of fractional anisotropy) and overlook tract geometry. Here we propose an automated workflow to cluster fibers using a white matter probabilistic atlas and perform genetic analysis on the shape characteristics of fiber tracts. We apply our approach to large study of 4-Tesla high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data from 198 healthy, young adult twins (age: 20-30). Illustrative results show heritability for the shapes of several major tracts, as color-coded maps.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe mental disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. Serotonin transporter (HTT) is a target of antidepressants and is one of the strongest candidate molecules of mood disorder, however, genetic study showed equivocal results. Here, we performed promoter-wide DNA methylation analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from two pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for BD. To rule out the possible discordance of copy number variation (CNV) between twins, we performed CNV analysis and found the copy number profiles were nearly identical between the twin pairs except for immunoglobulin-related regions. Among the three genes we obtained as candidate regions showing distinct difference of DNA methylation between one of the two pairs, hypermethylation of SLC6A4, encoding HTT, in the bipolar twin was only confirmed by bisulfite sequencing. Then, promoter hypermethylation of SLC6A4 in LCLs of BD patients was confirmed in a case-control analysis. DNA methylation of SLC6A4 was significantly correlated with its mRNA expression level in individuals with the S/S genotype of HTTLPR, and mRNA expression level was lower in BD patients carrying the S/S genotype. Finally, DNA methylation of the same site was also higher in the postmortem brains of BD patients. This is the first study to report the role of epigenetic modification of SLC6A4 in BD using an unbiased approach, which provides an insight for its pathophysiology.",

Here we present a case of conjoined twins in a triplet pregnancy diagnosed at 13 of weeks gestation. With the aid of 3D ultrasound and MRI images, the parents were counseled regarding the management options, including continuation of pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or selective fetocide. They chose selective fetocide of the conjoined twins and went on to deliver the remaining triplet at term. Conclusion. This case represents to our knowledge the only MRI images of conjoined twins in a triplet pregnancy and demonstrates how 3D imaging can be used to better counsel patients about management options.",

    "abstract": "Factor analysis of psychotic symptoms frequently results in positive, negative, and disorganized dimensions, but heritability estimates have not yet been reported. Symptom dimensions are usually only measured in individuals with psychotic disorders. Here, it is valuable to assess influences acting via liability to psychosis and independent modifying effects. We estimated heritability for psychotic symptom dimensions, taking account of these issues. Two-hundred-and-twenty-four probandwise twin pairs (106 monozygotic, 118 same-sex dizygotic), where probands had psychoses, were ascertained from the Maudsley Twin Register in London (1948-1993). Lifetime history of DSM-III-R psychotic disorder and psychotic symptom dimensions was assessed from clinical records and research interviews and rated using the Operational Criteria Checklist. Estimates of heritability and environmental components of variance in liability were made with structural equation modeling using a causal-contingent common pathway model adapted for ascertainment from a clinical register. Significant heritability was found for DSM-III-R psychotic disorder (h\u00b2\u2009=\u200990%, 95%CI 68-94%) and the disorganized symptom dimension (h\u00b2\u2009=\u200984%, 95%CI 18-93%). The heritability for the disorganized dimension remained significant when influences acting through liability to psychosis were set to zero, suggesting that some influences on disorganization are modifying factors independent of psychosis liability. However, the relative extent of modifying factors versus influences acting through psychosis liability could not be clearly determined. To our knowledge, this study provides the first formal evidence of substantive heritability for the disorganized symptom dimension, and suggests that genetic loci influencing disorganization in individuals with psychoses are in some cases different from loci that influence risk of psychotic disorders themselves.",

    "abstract": "We describe a pair of monozygotic twins with an attenuated form of mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I). At age 24, they both developed cervical myelopathy as a cardinal manifestation. They each also had mild valve abnormalities and both inguinal and umbilical hernia, however, other characteristic features of MPS-I were absent or very mild. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the cervical cord compressed by pachymeningeal hypertrophy. Surgery with dural plasty and laminoplasty resulted in decompression of the cervical cord with clinical improvement, revealing marked thickening of the dura mater. Both patients showed a marked decrease of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) activity with c.252insC (p.P55fsX62; known) and c.1209C>A (p.T374N; novel) mutations of the IDUA gene (IDUA). Patients with MPS-I have been reported to present with various clinical phenotypes and severities even if they have identical mutations of IDUA. The quite similar, unique phenotype in monozygotic twins suggests that not only IDUA mutation but also other genetic factors than IDUA markedly influence the clinical manifestations of MPS-I.",

    "abstract": "IVF treatments carry a high risk of twin pregnancy which confers a higher risk to the mother and child than singletons. Increased use of elective single embryo transfer (eSET) can reduce this twin rate. We aimed to utilize a previously published data set and statistical model based on routinely collected clinical data to predict the outcomes of policies that increase the proportion of eSET.\nThe models allow simultaneous prediction of outcomes from double embryo transfer (DET) and SET. These models were used to predict outcomes for different scenarios using SET in both the initial (fresh) transfer and over a complete cycle (transfer of all embryos created, with cryopreservation). A total of 16 096 cycles (12 487 fresh and 3609 frozen) from 9040 couples treated between 2000 and 2005 were included in the final analyses.\nFor any transfer, SET has about a one-third lower live birth rate relative to DET: this can be partially mitigated by appropriate patient and treatment cycle selection, with several realistic policies performing similarly. However, if we consider complete cycles with embryo cryopreservation, it is possible for repeat SET to produce more live births per egg retrieval than repeat DET.\nAll patients receiving SET would have a higher chance of successful treatment in that cycle if they received DET. The selection of appropriate patients for SET can partially ameliorate the overall loss. For complete cycles, repeat SET could produce more live births per egg retrieval than repeat DET. All treatments involving SET will increase the number of treatments required to achieve a successful outcome and this extra treatment burden will be a significant barrier to the implementation of such treatments.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory control (IC) is a dimension of child temperament that involves the self-regulation of behavioral responses under some form of instruction or expectation. Although IC is posited to appear in toddlerhood, the voluntary control of emotions such as anger begins earlier. Little research has analyzed relations between emotional development in infancy and later emerging IC. We examined phenotypic associations and genetic and environmental influences on parent- and laboratory-assessed anger and IC in a twin sample from 12 to 36 months of age. Typically, twins with low levels of IC had high levels of anger. Behavioral genetic findings confirmed significant genetic influences on anger and IC as assessed by parents, and on lab-based anger assessments. Shared environmental factors contributed to twin similarity on lab-assessed anger and IC at 36 months. Phenotypic covariance between anger and IC was largely due to overlapping genetic factors for parent ratings, and environmental factors in the laboratory.",

    "abstract": "Two pairs of twins with specific concordance in congenital heart lesions are presented. We reviewed all the monozygotic twins with specific concordance in congenital heart lesions in the last 18 years. Two pairs were found. First, a pair of 13 years-old monozygotic female twins; a severe infundibular and pulmonary valve stenosis was discovered in both girls. In the second pair of twins (8 years-old boys), Tetralogy of Fallot was diagnosed by echocardiogram, cardiac catheterization and angicardiography. In fluorescence hybridization test in situ all patients were negative for microdeletion in chromosome 22q11. Anatomic differences between twins are not enough explained on genetic bases; it's necessary to consider the role of other factors, probably acquired during the first stages of embryonic development. These are the two first pairs of twins with specific concordance in congenital cardiac lesions reported in Mexico.",

    "abstract": "A population-based record linkage case cohort of 239,995 births, to 119,214 women, born in Western Australia from 1980 to 2001 inclusive, was used to measure the recording of selected indicators of maternal health (current and prior) during pregnancy. We compared records of women with singleton pregnancies with that in twin pregnancies Mothers of first- and second-born singletons (n = 117,647) were compared with women with a first-born singleton followed by twins (n = 1,567). Binary indicators were used to calculate population prevalence of medical conditions, pregnancy complications and birth outcomes. Infant outcomes included stillbirth, low birthweight, preterm birth and birth defects. Women with twins were significantly older and taller, with similar rates of medical conditions and pregnancy complications during first singleton pregnancies compared with women with two consecutive singletons. However, during their second pregnancy, women with twins had significantly higher rates of essential hypertension, pre-eclampsia, threatened abortion, premature rupture of the membranes and ante partum hemorrhage with abruption than women with singletons. For both groups, maternal conditions in the first pregnancy were underreported in the second pregnancy, including diabetes, epilepsy, asthma, chronic renal dysfunction and essential hypertension. At the second birth, twins were 3 times more likely to be stillborn, 17 times more likely to be low birthweight and 4 times more likely to be delivered preterm compared with singletons. This research demonstrates the importance for epidemiologists and others, of having access to a complete maternal medical history for analyses of risks associated with maternal, infant and childhood morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder caused by heterozygotic inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene at 17q11.2. The associated phenotypes are highly variable, and modifying genes have been proposed to explain at least in part the intriguing expressivity. Given that haploinsufficiency of the NF1 gene product neurofibromin is responsible for some of the clinical manifestations, variations in expression of the wildtype NF1 allele might modify the phenotype. We therefore investigated epigenetic molecular modifications that could result in variable expression of the normal NF1 allele. To exclude confounding by DNA sequence variations, we analyzed monozygotic twin pairs with NF1 who presented with several discordant features. We fine-mapped the methylation pattern of a nearly 1 kb NF1 promoter region in lymphocytes of 8 twin pairs. All twin pairs showed significant intra-pair differences in methylation, especially of specific promoter subregions such as 5'UTR, exon 1 and intron 1 (+7 to +622), transcription factor binding sites and promoter elements like NF1HCS. Furthermore, we detected significant intra-pair differences in cytosine methylation for the region from -249 to -234 with regard to discordance for optic glioma with a higher grade of methylation in glioma cases. In conclusion, our findings of epigenetic differences of the NF1 promoter in leukocytes within mono zygotic twin pairs may serve as a proof of principle for other tissues. The results point towards a role of methylation patterns of the normal NF1 allele for expression differences and for modification of the NF1 phenotype.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to quantify contributions of genetic and environmental factors to variation in timing of emergence of the primary teeth in a sample of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, using univariate model-fitting approaches. The sample comprised 94 pairs of monozygotic twins and 125 pairs of dizygous twins, all of European ancestry, aged from 2-6 years. Tooth emergence timing was based on parental report, with a subset of data validated by clinical assessment. Heritability estimates for tooth emergence timing were generally high, around 90%, however estimates for the lower right lateral incisor and the lower canines were around 50%. These findings confirm a strong genetic influence on observed variation in the timing of emergence of the human primary teeth.",

    "abstract": "Cytotoxic precipitation of free \u03b1-globin monomers and its production of reactive oxygen species cause red cell membrane damage that leads to anemia and eventually ineffective erythropoiesis in \u03b2-thalassemia. Alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) was found to bind only to free \u03b1-globin monomers creating a stable and inert complex which remains soluble in the cytoplasm thus preventing harmful precipitations. Alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein was shown to bind nascent \u03b1-globin monomers with transient strength before transferring \u03b1-globin to \u03b2-globin to form hemoglobin tetramer. A classical twin study would be beneficial to investigate the role of genetics and environment in the variation of alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein expression as this knowledge will enable us to determine further investigations with regards to therapeutic interventions if alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein is to be a therapeutic agent for \u03b2-thalassemia. This study investigates the heritability influence of alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein expression and factors that may contribute to this. Results indicated that a major proportion of alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein expression was influenced by genetic heritability (46%) with cis-acting factors accounting for 19% and trans-acting factors at 27%.",

Depressive symptoms were assessed, as previously, with Children's Depression Inventory modified to be suitable for this age and reported as a total score and three subscales (low self-confidence, anhedonia and sadness) based on factor analysis as reported in a previous epidemiological study conducted in Finland. Items assessing nervous complaints and somatic symptoms were adapted from Finnish studies of juvenile health habits. Inter-twin dependence decreased with increasing age in both genders. Monozygotic twins, especially monozygotic females, reported most often to be dependent on their co-twin. When the symptom reporting was evaluated in relation to co-twin dependence, no relation was found between co-twin dependence and depressive symptom reporting. However, dependence-independence imbalance within twin pair was associated with elevated levels of depressive and psychosomatic symptoms, especially in twins who perceived themselves as dependent and the co-twin as independent. We conclude that there was no relation found between co-twin dependence and depressive symptom reporting in male and female twins except for the few imbalance cases, where most symptoms were reported by those dependent twins who felt their co-twin as independent.",

    "abstract": "We examined whether externalizing problem behaviors (hyperactivity-impulsivity, aggressiveness, and inattention) predict illicit drug use independently, or whether their associations with drug use are mediated through cigarette smoking. We used a prospective longitudinal design within the FinnTwin12-17 study among Finnish adolescents with baseline at age 12 and follow-up surveys at ages 14 and 17. Path models were conducted with Mplus and included 1992 boys and 2123 girls. The outcome was self-reported ever use of cannabis or other illicit drugs at age 17. The predictors were: externalizing behaviors (hyperactivity-impulsivity, aggressiveness, and inattention) assessed by teachers and parents (age 12) and self-reported cigarette smoking (age 14). The findings differed across behavior studied. The association of hyperactivity-impulsivity with drug use was mostly mediated through earlier cigarette smoking. Concerning aggressiveness and inattention, the results were different among girls than boys. Among girls no significant mediation occurred, whereas among boys more consistent evidence on mediation was seen. Consistently in all models, the direct association of early cigarette smoking on drug use was strong and highly significant. We conclude that the associations of externalizing problem behaviors with illicit drug use are partially mediated through cigarette smoking. Although interventions targeting externalizing problem behaviors may protect adolescents from early onset smoking and subsequently experimenting with drugs, interventions to prevent cigarette smoking initiation are also important in reducing risk of later drug use.",

    "abstract": "Although popularly designated as \"identical\", monozygotic (MZ) twins are rarely identical. Much has been speculated on the origin of MZ twins and several theories have been proposed. Post-fertilization events, such as chromosomal mosaicism, skewed X-inactivation and imprinting mechanisms, as well as other epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for the differences between MZ twins. Numerous discordant MZ twins have been reported including discordance for lateral asymmetry, major malformation, growth and intrauterine death of the co-twin. This discrepancy may have long-term implications on complex diseases and their predisposition, organ transplantation and interpretation of twin-based studies. We reviewed the genotypic and phenotypic differences between MZ twins and discuss their main causes.",

    "abstract": "The number of multiple pregnancies has increased, mainly due to the uncontrolled use of the assisted conception techniques. Multifetal pregnancy reduction (MFPR) has been used to reduce the risks associated with these high-risk pregnancies. It is performed in the first trimester of pregnancy by transabdominal injection of potassium chloride into the fetal heart. The risk of miscarriage seems to be associated with the final number of fetuses. A review of the literature suggests that MFPR results in better pregnancy outcome, regardless of the initial number of fetuses. The reduction to a lower number of fetuses reduces fetal losses, prematurity, infant mortality and morbidity.",

All amniocentesis-related adverse outcomes were reviewed, including aspiration of insufficient amniotic fluid, aspiration of hemorrhagic amniotic fluid, repeated puncture and miscarriage. The incidence of these adverse outcomes was compared between the two groups.\nIn total, 6270 cases were included in the study (Group 1, n=6150 and Group 2, n=120). Advanced maternal age was the main indication for amniocentesis in both singleton and twin pregnancies. There was no difference in the incidence of insufficient sample aspiration (0.2% in singletons vs. 0.0% in twins, P=NS), in the incidence of blood-stained amniotic fluid (3.7% in singletons vs. 4.6% in twins, P=NS), in the rate of need for second attempt (2.1% in singletons vs. 1.7% in twins, P=NS) or in the miscarriage rate (0.24% in singletons vs. 0% in twins).\nIn our experience, the incidence of amniocentesis-related adverse outcomes is not increased in diamniotic twins compared to singleton pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Heteropagus, or \"parasitic,\" twins are asymmetric conjoined twins in which the tissues of a severely defective twin (parasite) are dependent on the cardiovascular system of the other, largely intact twin (autosite) for survival. The estimated incidence of heteropagus twins is approximately 1 per 1 million live births. Isolated case reports comprise most of published work on this rare congenital anomaly. In the past, review articles have focused narrowly on one particular anatomical subtype of parasitic twin and/or on the anatomicopathology observed. Here, we present the epidemiology, proposed pathoembryogenic origins, anatomical abnormalities, management, and outcomes of the wide array of heteropagus twins described in the English language literature.",

    "abstract": "The patients were infant male twins born by cesarean delivery following a healthy pregnancy at 36 weeks' gestation to unrelated parents. At 4 months of age, twin 2 presented with hepatomegaly and a right suprarenal mass. Resection of an adrenal tumor and a liver tumor biopsy were performed. Twin 1 had no symptoms at 4 months of age. Screening by abdominal ultrasonography showed multiple masses in the liver but no adrenal mass. Metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy showed positive findings in multiple liver masses. A laparoscopic biopsy for a liver tumor was performed. All primary tumor and liver tumor specimens from twin 2 and the liver tumor of twin 1 had the same histologic classification of neuroblastoma and nearly identical genetic aberrations, including a chromosome gain or loss using array-comparative genomic hybridization. From these clinical and pathologic findings and genetic analyses, we strongly demonstrate the transplacental metastatic spread from twin 2 to twin 1. In the literature, 9 pairs of concordant twin neuroblastomas, including the current twin, have been presented; and the clinical findings of 5 twin pairs may represent placental metastases from one twin with congenital neuroblastoma to the other twin. This study is the first report presenting the possibility of twin-to-twin metastasis in monozygotic twins with neuroblastoma based on an analysis of the clinical features and genetic aberrations.",

    "abstract": "Emerging as an important metabolic regulator, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has gained considerable interest in diabetes and obesity research. The circulating FGF21 concentration is fairly low in normal individuals, but elevated hormone levels may associate with obesity. The determining factors of FGF21 levels in humans are not clear.\nOur objective was to study the influence of genetic and acquired components to serum FGF21 variability in healthy young adult twins.\nFasting serum FGF21, lipids, body fat, and oral glucose tolerance test were investigated in 46 monozygotic (MZ) and 75 dizygotic twin pairs aged 22.8-33.1 yr. Subcutaneous, intraabdominal, and liver fat content were measured by magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy in a subsample of 24 MZ pairs.\nGenetic factors contributed moderately (heritability 40%) to circulating serum FGF21 levels. Subjects with high FGF21 concentrations (\u2265 250 pg/ml, n = 30) had higher fasting triglycerides, insulin, homeostasis model assessment index, and area under the curve glucose and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol but similar measures of overall adiposity (body mass index, body fat percent) than subjects with lower FGF21 (<100 pg/ml, n = 148). Importantly, in the MZ subsample, higher liver fat but not sc or intraabdominal fat content was found in subjects with high FGF21. Furthermore, in analyses controlling for genetic/familial effects in twin pairs, within-pair differences in liver fat (MZ) and triglycerides (dizygotic pairs) were the major acquired factors that correlated with differences in FGF21 concentrations.\nGenetic factors influence serum FGF21 levels. Of the acquired components, high liver fat and triglycerides rather than overall adiposity associate with high FGF21 levels.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of acute respiratory insufficiency due to peripartum cardiomyopathy after Caesarean section in a term pregnancy with twins. The patient was a 30-year-old woman with a spontaneous twin pregnancy at 32 weeks of gestation who was admitted to our obstetrics department with preterm premature rupture of membranes. After 48 hours, the tocolysis was stopped and an uneventful Caesarean was performed under general anesthesia. As the patient was waking up, her SPO2 decreased to 32%, and she became cyanotic and tachypneic. Auscultation revealed rales in her lower lung lobes bilaterally. Her oxygen saturation did not increase in the hours that followed, and her cyanosis persisted, so we decided to admit her to the Intensive Care Unit. She was mechanically ventilated. Her chest X-ray showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and pulmonary infiltrates in the lower lobes. On the second postoperative day, transthoracic echocardiography was performed and revealed an EF of 45%, mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction and moderate mitral valve failure. Lisinopryl and furosemide were started. On postoperative day four, her symptoms and radiological signs had resolved. She was weaned from mechanical ventilation and discharged from the obstetric ward on postoperative day seven.\n\u0130kiz gebeli\u011fi olan ve postoperatif d\u00f6nemde kardiyomiyopatiye ba\u011fl\u0131 akut solunum yetmezli\u011fi geli\u015fen bir olgu sunulmu\u015ftur.

    "abstract": "Ectopic fat in muscle and liver is linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Recently, pancreatic lipid accumulation has also been associated with \u03b2-cell dysfunction and reduced insulin production, leading to the development of type 2 diabetes. Physical exercise training has been shown to attenuate \u03b2-cell dysfunction in patients, but little is known about its effects on pancreatic and hepatic fat accumulation. In this study, we validated in-vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) in pancreatic fat measurement with biochemical measurements in a pig model. Thereafter, the effects of increased physical activity on the amounts of pancreatic and liver fat were studied in eight monozygotic twin pairs who have discordant physical activity and fitness.\nPancreatic fat content was studied in 15 pigs using (1)H MRS and/or biochemical analyses. In addition, liver and pancreatic fat were assessed using (1)H MRS in eight monozygotic male twin pairs with 18% mean difference in VO(2max) between the twin brothers.\nTwins with higher physical fitness had 23% less liver fat (1.3\u00b11.3% vs. 2.1\u00b12.6%, p=0.022) but no such difference was observed in the pancreatic fat (8.2\u00b19.3% vs. 9.8\u00b18.5%, respectively, p=0.3). Hepatic fat content was inversely associated with VO(2max). A positive association was found between pancreatic and liver fat contents (\u03b2=5.18, p=0.012). Pancreatic fat content was also associated with insulin sensitivity indexes and plasma adiponectin and glutamyltransferase concentrations.\nPancreatic fat content is associated with insulin resistance and hepatic fat content. An active lifestyle seems to beneficially influence hepatic fat metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a disease of multifactorial etiology. Genetic and intrauterine mechanical factors influence the development of the hip joint and the incidence of DDH. Breech position is a risk factor for DDH. The aim of this study is to analyze whether in twins, the intrauterine mechanical factors, such as a breech position, limitation of fetal mobility, limitation of hip abduction, and increase the incidence of DDH may, therefore, be considered as risk factors.\nA pair of twins with either breech or cephalic presentation, and no family history of DDH or any other sicknesses were included in this study. During a 6-year period between 2002 and 2007, data were collected on 105 consecutively born twins (210 children with 420 hips) of whom 48 were a cephalic breech, 35 were a cephalic-cephalic, and 22 were a breech-breech presentation. The presentation was defined by regular prenatal ultrasounds and the obstetric records at birth. The average gestational age was 36.7 weeks and average weight at birth was 2290 g. Control group 1 consisted of 274 single gestation children, with a cephalic presentation at birth. The average gestational age was 39.1 weeks and average weight at birth was 3200 g. Control group 2 consisted of 48 single gestation children, with a breech presentation at birth. The average gestational age was 36.8 weeks and average weight at birth was 2870 g. Ultrasonography of the hips was done according to the Graf technique. Statistical analysis was done using a \u03c7\u00b2 test.\nThe \u03c7\u00b2 test was used and it showed no significant association between the presence or absence of pathologic hip types in the twins group and in the 2 control groups. A higher incidence of DDH (3.4%) was present in groups 1 and 2.\nThis comparison of a large series of twins with matched controls shows that there is no increased incidence of DDH in twins when compared with single birth infants with no family history of DDH. This study supports the idea that breech presentation in twins is not a risk factor, when knees are flexed.\nRetrospective study. Level 2 study.",

    "abstract": "Men outperform women in mental rotation by about one standard deviation. Prenatal exposure to testosterone has been suggested as one cause. In animals it has been shown that a female fetus located between two male ones is exposed to higher levels of testosterone. It is still unclear whether intra-uterine hormone transfer exists in humans. Therefore, the influence of an intra-uterine presence of a male co twin was studied in female fraternal twins (N=200). Women with a male co-twin outperformed women with a female co-twin by about a third standard deviation. In a no-twin control group (N=200), performance of women with a slightly older sibling did not depend upon the sibling's sex. These findings provide preliminary support for the theory of an influence of prenatal testosterone on mental rotation performance.",

Both the cases presented a good limb length and an optimal correction of associated deformities after the treatment, fulfilling the indications. Surgical indications were mostly led by the axial deviations of the lower limbs, and the timing of the limb-lengthening procedures has been the same in both couples showing the importance of this aspect.",

    "abstract": "Craniorachischisis is a rare neural tube defect in which both acrania and a complete schisis of the vertebral column are present. Heterotaxy results from failure to establish normal left-right asymmetry during embryonic development and is characterized by a variable group of congenital anomalies that include complex cardiac malformations and situs inversus or situs ambiguous. We report a diamniotic twin pregnancy with two malformed fetuses affected one by craniorachischisis and the other by heterotaxya with paired right-sided viscera, asplenia, and complex congenital heart disease. The occurrence of severe congenital anomalies in both members of the twin pair implies a strong influence of genetic factors. At present, the genetic basis determining the different phenotypes observed in our twins is unknown. Our case with the simultaneous presence of both midline and laterality defects in twins supports the hypothesis that the midline plays a critical role in establishing left-right asymmetry in the body and that a mutation in a gene responsible for both heterotaxy and midline defects may be strongly supposed.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the maternal risk factors for small-for-gestational age (SGA) newborns in Japanese dichorionic (DC) twins.\nA retrospective study was conducted from 2003 to 2008 on 340 DC twin pregnancies resulting in two live births. Newborns were classified as SGA if their birth weight was below the 10th percentile according to Japanese singleton norms. Statistical differences were evaluated between pregnancies resulting in appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) pairs and those resulting in at least one SGA neonate.\nThe study population consisted of AGA/AGA (50.8%), AGA/SGA (37.0%) and SGA/SGA pairs (12.0%). Logistic regression analysis identified significant interrelations for SGA with maternal nulliparity (odds ratio [OR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30-0.91), smoking (OR 3.25, 95% CI 1.09-9.66), assisted reproductive technology (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.30-0.89), pregnancy-induced hypertension (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.01-4.31), pregravid weight (kg) (unitary OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.97) and monthly weight gain (kg/month) (unitary OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14-0.44). Bivariable receiver operating characteristic curves were generated for monthly weight gain (area under the curve [AUC] 0.626, cutoff 1.41 kg/month, P<0.001) and total weight gain (AUC 0.615, cutoff 14.0 kg, P<0.001).\nCigarette smoking and weight gain control are relatively modifiable factors for which interventional management is necessary to avoid perinatal problems arising from SGA pregnancy. Further studies are needed to investigate optimal nutrition, health guidance and subsequent weight gain control that lead to concrete improvement in maternal and infant prognoses.",

The result remained significant after adjustment for age, BMI, smoking, symptoms of chronic bronchitis, marital status and zygosity, men: OR = 1.70 (1.07-2.70), P = 0.026; women: OR = 1.88 (1.24-2.85), P = 0.003. In this analysis, BMI remained a highly significant predictor for asthma independently of diabetes status in women, P < 0.000 but not in men, P = 0.336.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the possible correlation between smoking status and biomarkers of exposure (BoE) and biological effect (BoBE) in monozygotic twins discordant for smoking status (smoker and non-smoker pairs). By eliminating potential genetic variability in this manner, a clearer pattern of the effects of lifestyle and environmental exposures should become apparent.\nThis was a cross-sectional study on monozygotic healthy twins (44 subjects, 26 males and 18 females) with a mean age 31.5 years. BoE to cigarette smoke and BoBE were measured in body fluids (24 h urine and blood) after medical pre-screening.\nAll BoE were significantly higher in the smoker twins. Among BoBE, 11-dehydrothromboxane B(2) (11-dehydro TBX), 2,3-dinorthromboxane B(2) (2,3-dinor TBX), 8-epi-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-epiPGF), hydroxyproline (OH-P), fibrinogen, white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and heart rate were statistically significantly increased in the smoker compared to the non-smoker twins. Moreover, statistically significant correlations between neutrophil count and 11-dehydro TBX (r=0.32), WBC and 8-epiPGF (r=0.33), OH-P and 8-epiPGF (r=0.49) and heart rate and fibrinogen (r=0.46) were observed.\nThe study results confirmed the reliability of the BoE for the evaluation of smoking status. Moreover, a subset of the BoBE, reported as being associated with inflammatory conditions and early stages of vascular disorders, has emerged as showing a consistent relationship with smoking status from the present and the previous studies. By using monozygotic twin pairs, genetic variability has been excluded as a possible source of variability in this study. These results should assist in the interpretation of other population studies using these biomarkers.",

Growth of the face and the nasomaxillary complex was longitudinally assessed and compared by means of facial photographs and cephalometric x-rays. Twin A suffered Le Fort II and III fractures with an associated frontal bone injury in early childhood and subsequently developed significant midface hypoplasia; twin B had no trauma and normal facial growth and development. Facial profile difference between the twins gradually became more pronounced until age 19. Twin A had obvious retrusion of the midfacial region, including the nasal bones on visual examination and radiographic study. At age 20, she underwent orthognathic surgical correction of the traumatic deformity. Her unaffected sibling, twin B, provided the genetic facial phenotype for the surgical orthognathic reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Associations between parental depression and offspring affective and disruptive disorders are well documented. Few genetically informed studies have explored the processes underlying intergenerational associations.\nA semi-structured interview assessing DSM-III-R psychiatric disorders was administered to twins (n=1296) from the Australian Twin Register (ATR), their spouses (n=1046) and offspring (n=2555). We used the Children of Twins (CoT) design to delineate the extent to which intergenerational associations were consistent with a causal influence or due to genetic confounds.\nIn between-family analyses, parental depression was associated significantly with offspring depression [hazard ratio (HR) 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.93] and conduct disorder (CD; HR 2.27, CI 1.31-3.93). Survival analysis indicated that the intergenerational transmission of depression is consistent with a causal (environmental) inference, with a significant intergenerational association in offspring of discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs (HR 1.39, CI 1.00-1.94). Logistic regression analysis suggested that the parental depression-offspring CD association was due to shared genetic liability in the parents and offspring. No intergenerational association was found when comparing the offspring of discordant MZ twins [odds ratio (OR) 1.41, CI 0.63-3.14], but offspring of discordant dizygotic (DZ) twins differed in their rates of CD (OR 2.53, CI 0.95-6.76). All findings remained after controlling for several measured covariates, including history of depression and CD in the twins' spouses.\nThe mechanisms underlying associations between parental depression and offspring psychopathology seem to differ depending on the outcome. The results are consistent with a causal environmental role of parental depression in offspring depression whereas common genetic factors account for the association of parental depression and offspring CD.",

Survival analysis indicated that the intergenerational transmission of depression is consistent with a causal (environmental) inference, with a significant intergenerational association in offspring of discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs (HR 1.39, CI 1.00-1.94). Logistic regression analysis suggested that the parental depression-offspring CD association was due to shared genetic liability in the parents and offspring. No intergenerational association was found when comparing the offspring of discordant MZ twins [odds ratio (OR) 1.41, CI 0.63-3.14], but offspring of discordant dizygotic (DZ) twins differed in their rates of CD (OR 2.53, CI 0.95-6.76). All findings remained after controlling for several measured covariates, including history of depression and CD in the twins' spouses.",

    "abstract": "We report two cases of mirror image anomalies in two different pairs of monozygotic twins. In case 1, the twins exhibited mirroring of strabismus and refractive errors. Twin 1 had 35 prism diopters (PD) right intermittent exotropia at distant fixation and myopic anisometropia that was spherical 2.00 diopters more myopic in the right eye. Twin 2 had 35 PD left intermittent exotropia at distant fixation and her left eye was more myopic by - spherical 1.00 diopters. In case 2, the twins were diagnosed with infantile nystagmus with upbeat jerk. Twin 1 exhibited a habitual head turn of 30\u00b0 to the left with dampening of her nystagmus in dextroversion. Twin 2 also exhibited abnormal head position, but in his case the habitual turn was 30\u00b0 to the right. We believe that this is the first report describing mirror imaged intermittent exotropia with anisometropia and infantile nystagmus with opposite abnormal head positions in pairs of monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "More education is associated with healthier smoking and drinking behaviors. Most analyses of effects of education focus on mean levels. Few studies have compared variance in health-related behaviors at different levels of education or analyzed how education impacts underlying genetic and environmental sources of health-related behaviors. This study explored these influences. In a 2002 postal questionnaire, 21,522 members of the Danish Twin Registry, born during 1931-1982, reported smoking and drinking habits. The authors used quantitative genetic models to examine how these behaviors' genetic and environmental variances differed with level of education, adjusting for birth-year effects. As expected, more education was associated with less smoking, and average drinking levels were highest among the most educated. At 2 standard deviations above the mean educational level, variance in smoking and drinking was about one-third that among those at 2 standard deviations below, because fewer highly educated people reported high levels of smoking or drinking. Because shared environmental variance was particularly restricted, one explanation is that education created a culture that discouraged smoking and heavy drinking. Correlations between shared environmental influences on education and the health behaviors were substantial among the well-educated for smoking in both sexes and drinking in males, reinforcing this notion.",

Alloimmunized dizygotic twin pregnancy allows us to compare anemic and non-anemic twins in the same intrauterine environment. We herein present a case of Rh (E)-incompatible dizygotic twin pregnancy, where MCA-PSV could precisely detect the anemia in one of the twins. A 36-year-old woman, whose previous child required exchange transfusion due to hemolytic anemia of newborn (HFDN), conceived twins after in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer. At 24 weeks' gestation, MCA-PSV of twin A and twin B were 23.9 cm/s (0.8 multiples of median; MoM) and 30.7 cm/s (1.0 MoM), respectively. At 31 weeks' gestation, MCA-PSV values of both twins were sharply elevated to nearly 1.4 MoM. Thereafter, MCA-PSV of twin A fell to 1.0 MoM, whereas MCA-PSV of twin B exceeded 1.5 MoM at 34 weeks' gestation. Development of fetal anemia was suspected and emergency cesarean section was performed. Twin B showed moderate anemia with positive direct Coombs' test and was diagnosed as HFDN due to anti-E alloimmunization. Twin B required phototherapy and red cell transfusion, but exchange transfusion was safely obviated.",

    "abstract": "Jumping translocations (JTs) are rare constitutional or acquired rearrangements involving a donor and several receiver chromosomes. They may be inherited or de novo. JTs can be found as a cultural artifact, in normal individuals or in pathological conditions. The clinical consequences range from spontaneous abortion, loss of fetus, chromosome syndrome, congenital abnormalities, and infertility to malignancy. Considering the breakpoints of JTs, they are localized predominantly in repeat regions such as pericentromeric, centromeric, subtelomeric, telomeric, and occasionally interstitial regions that may be in a low copy repeats (LCR) or in a telomere like sequence. Differences between the constitutional and acquired JTs donor breakpoints suggest an independent mechanism in their formation. In this review, a new JT involving a donor chromosome 18p10qter and recipients 17q25qter or 1q25qter found by CVS of a twin pregnancy is described. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenges posed by JTs.In this study, our knowledge on JTs is consolidated to improve identification, management, and counseling.",

    "abstract": "This article discusses results of a questionnaire survey of 156 university students in Israel and Austria examining reactions towards the Belated Twins scenario, which entails the artificial twinning of embryos of which one is immediately carried to term while the other one is born later. The scenario resembles a case of human reproductive cloning in terms of result (the creation of genetically identical individuals in a time-delayed manner) but it involves gamete fusion like \"natural\" reproduction. By means of qualitative text analysis we discuss the core themes mobilized both in support and opposition to the scenario. While Israeli and Austrian respondents held similar general attitudes (about half were in favour of legalizing Belated Twins, while about a third opposed it), they drew partly on different arguments to arrive at their conclusions. In both groups, uncertainty stemming from \"novel\" elements in the scenario was regularly interpreted as negatively exacerbating existing issues.",

    "abstract": "Thirty same-sex twin pairs were identified in which both members were assessed at baseline and one twin subsequently developed dementia, at least 3 years subsequent to the baseline measurement, while the partner remained cognitively intact for at least three additional years. Eighteen of the 30 cases were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Baseline assessments, conducted when twins' average age was 70.6 (SD = 6.8), included a mailed questionnaire and in-person testing. Which twin would develop dementia was predicted by less favorable lipid values (higher apoB, ratio of apoB to apoA1, and total cholesterol), poorer grip strength, and-to a lesser extent-higher emotionality on the EAS Temperament Scale. Given the long preclinical period that characterizes Alzheimer's disease, these findings may suggest late life risk factors for dementia, or may reflect changes that are part of preclinical disease.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relationship of birth weight with ocular measures in a Caucasian twin population.\nCross-sectional study of 1498 twins (308 monozygotic and 441 dizygotic pairs) aged between 5 to 80 years participating in the Australian Twins Eye Study.\nAll participants underwent ophthalmic examination including bilateral cycloplegic autorefraction, keratometry, interpupillary distance (IPD), central corneal thickness, intraocular pressure (IOP), and retinal photography. Birth weight and gestation were obtained from a self-administered questionnaire. A subset of the twins also participated in the Tasmanian Infant Health Study (288) and the Childhood Blood Pressure Study (184), which collected data on birth parameters allowing for verification of data. Linear mixed models were used for the main analysis.\nBoth the within-pair (\u03b2(w) 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15, 0.38 mm per kg increase in birth weight, P < .001) and between-pair associations (\u03b2(B) 0.22, 95% CI 0.08, 0.35, P = .002) of birth weight with axial length were significant and of similar magnitude (difference in effect, P = .56), after adjusting for relevant confounders. In contrast, birth weight was negatively associated with corneal curvature (\u03b2(w) -0.82, 95% CI -1.09, -0.55 diopters per kg increase; \u03b2(B) -0.69, 95% CI -0.98, -0.41, both P < .001). These associations remained significant within dizygotic and monozygotic pairs. Refraction, anterior chamber depth, IPD, IOP, and optic disc parameters are unrelated to birth weight.\nConsistent with previous studies in singleton children, lower birth weight is associated with shorter axial length and more curved corneas in this twin study. This also adds new insights into the emmetropization process.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for adverse neonatal outcome in twins in order to provide a basis for the improvement of the survival and neonatal outcomes of twins.\nData from 254 twins admitted to Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University From January 2005 to December 2009 were retrospectively studied. Risk factors for adverse neonatal outcomes were assessed by logistic regression analysis.\nOf the 254 twins, 84 (33.1%) had an adverse outcome, including 10 (3.9%) neonatal deaths. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that gestational age (\u226434 weeks), cord abnormalities, meconium-stained amniotic fluid and 5-min Apgar scores (\u22647) were independent risk factors for adverse neonatal outcomes (OR=4.434, 4.731, 3.424, 18.958, respectively; P=0.021, 0.001, 0.037, 0.011, respectively). Conception by assisted reproductive technology was shown as a protective factor for adverse neonatal outcomes (OR=0.389, P=0.037).\nThe twins with gestational age \u226434 weeks, cord abnormalities, meconium-stained amniotic fluid or 5-min Apgar scores (\u22647) are subject to adverse neonatal outcome.",

    "abstract": "White matter microstructure is under strong genetic control, yet it is largely unknown how genetic influences change from childhood into adulthood. In one of the largest brain mapping studies ever performed, we determined whether the genetic control over white matter architecture depends on age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and intelligence quotient (IQ). We assessed white matter integrity voxelwise using diffusion tensor imaging at high magnetic field (4-Tesla), in 705 twins and their siblings (age range 12-29; 290 M/415 F). White matter integrity was quantified using a widely accepted measure, fractional anisotropy (FA). We fitted gene-environment interaction models pointwise, to visualize brain regions where age, sex, SES and IQ modulate heritability of fiber integrity. We hypothesized that environmental factors would start to outweigh genetic factors during late childhood and adolescence. Genetic influences were greater in adolescence versus adulthood, and greater in males than in females. Socioeconomic status significantly interacted with genes that affect fiber integrity: heritability was higher in those with higher SES. In people with above-average IQ, genetic factors explained over 80% of the observed FA variability in the thalamus, genu, posterior internal capsule, and superior corona radiata. In those with below-average IQ, however, only around 40% FA variability in the same regions was attributable to genetic factors. Genes affect fiber integrity, but their effects vary with age, sex, SES and IQ. Gene-environment interactions are vital to consider in the search for specific genetic polymorphisms that affect brain integrity and connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations can be affected by several environmental and individual factors. It is not clear to what extent genetic influences play a role in determining vitamin D status. Thus far, studies on the heritability of vitamin D have provided conflicting results.\nWe estimated the heritability of vitamin D concentrations and the effect of season on heritability estimates.\nWe measured serum 25(OH)D concentrations in 510 middle-aged, male twins (310 monozygotic and 200 dizygotic twins) selected from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Generalized estimating equations were used to test the association between 25(OH)D and other study factors. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the heritability of 25(OH)D.\nThe twins' mean (\u00b1SD) age was 55 \u00b1 2.8 y. The mean (\u00b1SD) 25(OH)D concentration was 38.4 \u00b1 23.3 ng/mL with a substantial seasonal variation (a 6.1-ng/mL lower value during the winter than during the summer, P = 0.003). Approximately 70% of the variation in 25(OH)D concentrations during the winter was explained by genetic factors. However, in the summer, 25(OH)D concentrations were not heritable. During the summer, 53% of the variation in 25(OH)D concentrations was due to shared environmental factors, and 47% of the variation in 25(OH)D concentrations was due to unique environmental factors.\nSerum 25(OH)D concentrations are highly heritable during the winter season only. In the summer, environmental conditions (eg, sun exposure) prevail over genetic backgrounds in determining serum 25(OH)D concentrations. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00017836.",

    "abstract": "Given the adverse neurobiological effects of suboptimal nutrition on the developing brain, it is of social and medical importance to determine if the global prevalence of poor intrauterine growth causes lasting cognitive deficits. We examined whether suboptimal intrauterine growth relates to impaired cognitive outcome by comparing birth weight and cognition in monozygotic twins and considered whether children within-pair differences in birth weight were related to within-pair differences in IQ scores.\nA total of 71 monozygotic twin pairs (aged 7 years 11 months to 17 years 3 months) participated. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition, was administered, and verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ) scores were calculated. Regression was used to relate within-pair differences in birth weight to within-pair differences in IQ scores.\nVIQ but not PIQ score was affected by prenatal growth restriction. The results suggest that the mean advantage for heavier twins relative to their lighter co-twins can be as much as half an SD in VIQ points. In pairs with minimal discordance, heavier twins had lower VIQ scores than their lighter co-twins.\nOur study results suggest that lower birth weight in monozygotic twins can also have a negative long-term impact on cognition both in infants who are small at birth and also those with birth weights across the spectrum. Studying monozygotic twins enabled us to examine the effect of reduced intrauterine growth on cognition independently of confounding factors, including parental IQ and education and infant gender, age, genetic characteristics, and gestation.",

    "abstract": "To review the long-term urological outcomes of six sets of ischiopagus and pygopagus conjoined twins. Emphasis is placed on the particular genitourinary challenges of separation, reconstruction and monitoring of these patients.\nWe performed a longitudinal, retrospective analysis of six sets of conjoined twins who presented to a single center and describe their long-term urological outcomes.\nSix sets of ischiopagus (4) and pygopagus (2) conjoined twins presented from 1993 to 2003 and have been followed up for a mean of 12 years (range 7-17 years). Separation was achieved in 5/6 cases; the remaining one died of intestinal perforation and resultant sepsis. One further child died of malaria after separation.

    "abstract": "Mesiodens is the most common type of supernumerary tooth found in the premaxilla. It might be discovered by the orthodontist by chance on a radiograph or as the cause of an unerupted maxillary central incisor. The genetic transmission of supernumerary and impacted teeth is poorly understood. The occurrence of identical unerupted maxillary central incisors and mesiodentes in monozygotic twins suggests that genetic factors might influence the etiology of this problem. In this case report, we discuss the treatment of unerupted maxillary permanent incisors caused by mesiodentes in monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "\"Core-rod myopathy\" is a rare congenital myopathy characterized by the presence of \"cores\" and \"rods\" in distinct locations in the same or different muscle fibres. This association is linked currently to mutations in RYR1, NEB and ACTA1 genes. We report identical twins who presented with polyhydramnios and loss of fetal motility during pregnancy; hypotonia, arthrogryposis and swallowing impairment at birth; need of immediate respiratory support and death at 27 and 50 days of life. Muscle biopsies, performed at 27 days of life in twin 1 and at 49 days in twin 2, showed the presence of separate cores and rods in the muscle fibres, both at light and electron microscopy. The molecular analysis showed a heterozygous de novo mutation (Ile4898Thr) of the RYR1 gene. The molecular study of ACTA1, TMP2 and TMP3 genes did not show abnormalities. This is the first report of a lethal form of congenital \"core-rod myopathy\". The mutation Ile4898Thr has been previously described in central core disease but not in core-rod myopathy. The report enlarges the phenotypic spectrum of \"core-rod myopathy\" and highlights the morphological variability associated to special RYR1 mutations.",

    "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by inexorable loss of muscle tissue. One of the underlying causes for this is the massive change in the hormonal milieu of the body. The role of a female sex steroid - estrogen - in these processes is frequently neglected, although the rapid decline in its production coincides with a steep deterioration in muscle performance. We recruited 54- to 62-year-old monozygotic female twin pairs discordant for postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT, n=11 pairs; HRT use 7.3 \u00b1 3.7 years) from the Finnish Twin Cohort to investigate the association of long-term, estrogen-based HRT with skeletal muscle transcriptome. Pathway analysis of muscle transcript profiles revealed significant HRT-induced up-regulation of a biological process related to regulation of cell structure and down-regulation of processes concerning, for example, cell-matrix interactions, energy metabolism and utilization of nutrients (false discovery rate < 0.15). Lending clinical relevance to the findings, these processes explained a significant fraction of the differences observed in relative proportion of muscle within thigh and in muscle performance (R(2) =0.180-0.257, P=0.001-0.023). Although energy metabolism was affected through down-regulation of the transcripts related to succinate dehydrogenase complex in mitochondria, no differences were observed in mtDNA copy number or oxidative capacity per muscle cross section. In conclusion, long-term use of HRT was associated with subtle, but significant, differences in muscle transcript profiles. The better muscle composition and performance among the HRT users appeared to be orchestrated by improved regulatory actions on cytoskeleton, preservation of muscle quality via regulation of intramuscular extracellular matrix and a switch from glucose-oriented metabolism to utilization of fatty acids.",

    "abstract": "To examine the association between diurnal type and smoking status and nicotine dependence (ND).\nA cohort study using random-effects model regressions for repeated longitudinal panel data was used to analyse smoking status by diurnal type. Regression analyses examined the association between diurnal type and ND.\nA total of 23, 289 same-sex adult twin individuals from Finnish Twin Cohort. Nicotine dependence was studied in a subsample of 676 twin individuals.\nSubjects were classified by self-report into four categories: morning type, somewhat morning type, somewhat evening type, evening type (in 1981). Smoking status was defined as current and ever smoking (in 1975, 1981 and 1990). ND was measured by DSM-IV and Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) (during 2001-05). Findings\u2003 Evening types of both genders were much more likely to be current (OR\u2003=\u20032.91, 95% CI 2.50, 3.38) and life-time smokers (OR\u2003=\u20032.67, 95% CI 2.96, 4.07) compared to morning types. Evening types were less likely to stop smoking. The risk of nicotine dependence assessed by DSM-IV criteria was higher among evening types (OR\u2003=\u20032.78, 95% CI 1.64, 4.72). Evening types scored 0.59 (95% CI 0.01, 1.17) points higher than morning types on the FTND. Adjustment for potential confounders did not change these associations.\nBeing an evening type is associated independently with a higher risk of being a current smoker, being more highly dependent upon cigarettes and a lower likelihood of stopping smoking. Understanding the cause of these associations could elucidate the causes of tobacco addiction.",

    "abstract": "The minor G-allele of FOXO3A rs2802292 has been associated with longevity. We aimed to investigate whether a phenotype related to healthy metabolic aging could be identified in individuals carrying the longevity-associated FOXO3A rs2802292 G-allele.\nrs2802292 was genotyped in a phenotypically well-characterized population of young and elderly twins (n = 190) and in the population-based Inter99 cohort (n = 5768). All participants underwent oral glucose tolerance tests, and the twin population was additionally examined with an iv glucose tolerance test and a hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp. Basal and insulin-stimulated FOXO3A mRNA expression was assessed in skeletal muscle biopsies from the twin population.\nIn the twin sample, carriers of the minor G-allele of rs2802292 showed reduced fasting plasma insulin [per allele effect (\u03b2) = -13% (-24; -1) (95% confidence interval), P = 0.03] and lower incremental area under the curve 0-120 min for insulin after an oral glucose load [\u03b2 = -14% (-23; -5), P = 0.005].

    "abstract": "Although postmenopausal hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) is known to prevent fractures, knowledge on the influence of long-term HRT on bone strength and its determinants other than areal bone mineral density is scarce. This study used a genetically controlled design with 24 monozygotic female twin pairs aged 54 to 72 years in which one cotwin was using HRT (mean duration 8 years) and the other had never used HRT. Estimated bone strength, cross-sectional area, volumetric bone mineral density, bone mineral mass, and cross-sectional density and mass distributions were assessed in the tibial shaft, distal tibia, and distal radius with peripheral computed tomography (pQCT). In the tibial shaft, HRT users had 9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 3%-15%] higher estimated bending strength than their nonusing cotwins. Larger cortical area and higher cortical bone mineral density accounted for this difference. The cortex was larger in the HRT users in the endocortical region. In the distal tibia, estimated compressive strength was 24% (95% CI 9%-40%) higher and in the distal radius 26% (95% CI 11%-41%) higher in the HRT users than in their nonusing cotwins owing to higher volumetric bone mineral density. No difference between users and nonusers was observed in total bone cross-sectional area in any measured bone site. The added mineral mass in the HRT users was distributed evenly within and between bone sites. In postmenopausal women, long-term HRT preserves estimated bone strength systemically by preventing bone mineral loss similarly in body weight-loaded and non-weight-loaded bone.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of ultrasound assessment to predict risk of mortality in expectantly managed monochorionic twin fetuses with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR).\nThis was a retrospective study of 101 monochorionic twin pregnancies diagnosed with sIUGR before 26 weeks of gestation. All patients were under expectant management during the observation period. At the initial evaluation, the presence or absence of each of the following abnormalities was documented: oligohydramnios; stuck twin phenomenon; severe IUGR < 3(rd) centile of estimated fetal weight; abnormal Doppler in the umbilical artery; and polyhydramnios in the larger twin. The relationships between these ultrasound findings and mortality of sIUGR fetuses were evaluated using multiple logistic regression analysis.\nOf 101 sIUGR twins, 22 (21.8%) fetuses suffered intrauterine demise and nine (8.9%) suffered neonatal death; 70 (69.3%) survived the neonatal period. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the stuck twin phenomenon (odds ratio (OR): 14.5; 95% CI: 2.2-93.2; P = 0.006) and constantly absent diastolic flow in the umbilical artery (OR: 29.4; 95% CI: 3.3-264.0; P = 0.003) were significant risk factors for mortality.\nNot only abnormal Doppler flow in the umbilical artery but also severe oligohydramnios should be recognized as important indicators for mortality in monochorionic twins with sIUGR.",

    "abstract": "The common genetic and environmental effects on endophenotypes related to the metabolic syndrome have been investigated using bivariate and multivariate twin models. This paper extends the pairwise analysis approach by introducing independent and common pathway models to Chinese twin data. The aim was to explore the common genetic architecture in the development of these phenotypes in the Chinese population.\nThree multivariate models including the full saturated Cholesky decomposition model, the common factor independent pathway model and the common factor common pathway model were fitted to 695 pairs of Chinese twins representing six phenotypes including BMI, total cholesterol, total triacylglycerol, fasting glucose, HDL and LDL. Performances of the nested models were compared with that of the full Cholesky model.\nCross-phenotype correlation coefficients gave clear indication of common genetic or environmental backgrounds in the phenotypes. Decomposition of phenotypic correlation by the Cholesky model revealed that the observed phenotypic correlation among lipid phenotypes had genetic and unique environmental backgrounds. Both pathway models suggest a common genetic architecture for lipid phenotypes, which is distinct from that of the non-lipid phenotypes. The declining performance with model restriction indicates biological heterogeneity in development among some of these phenotypes.\nOur multivariate analyses revealed common genetic and environmental backgrounds for the studied lipid phenotypes in Chinese twins. Model performance showed that physiologically distinct endophenotypes may follow different genetic regulations.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the association between discordant crown-rump length (CRL) measurements in structurally normal euploid dichorionic twins and adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nThis retrospective cohort study included women with dichorionic twins who underwent chorionic villus sampling and delivered in our facility from January 2000 to September 2007. Only pregnancies with viable twin fetuses and normal karyotypes were included. The association between CRL discordance, defined as a CRL discrepancy of 9% or greater, and adverse pregnancy outcomes was evaluated.\nSeventy-eight women met inclusion criteria and included 24 discordant twins (group 1) and 54 concordant twins (group 2). Maternal ages were similar: mean \u00b1 SD, 38.2 \u00b1 3.1 years in group 1 versus 39.2 \u00b1 3.9 years in group 2 (P = not significant). The median gestational ages at delivery were 35.6 \u00b1 3.1 weeks in group 1 and 37.3 \u00b1 2.0 weeks in group 2 (P < .01). At least 1 major complication occurred in 19 women (79%) in group 1 and 25 (46%) in group 2 (P = .01). Group 1 had significantly more major complications overall (P = .0008).

    "abstract": "Our aims were to assess the incidence of birthweight discordance of twins, to explore risk factors and its impact on perinatal mortality, and to quantify the risks at different severity of birthweight discordance in Japan, by using a nationwide obstetric database. There were 10,828 pairs of twins, born from 2001 to 2005 recorded in the database of the national Perinatal Health Care Project, fully enrolled. The overall incidence of birthweight discordance was 47.34%. The incidence of mild, severe and extremely severe discordance was 19.26%, 10.21% and 17.87%, respectively. The incidence of birthweight discordance in Japan is much higher than that in other countries, particularly at higher severity level. By linear regression model, our study added independent factors of primiparity (p < .001), sex composition (p < .001), chorionicity (p < .001), gestational age (p < .001), and delivery mode (p < .001) in determining birthweight discordance percentage. Maternal age and application of assisted reproduction technologies (ART) didn't significantly influence the birthweight discordance. The birthweight discordance is closely associated with gestational age and affected discharge mortality. From 25% of birthweight discordance, risk to discharge mortality tended to significantly increase, suggesting it should be added as a reference for clinical practices.",

    "abstract": "Health is a multidimensional and continual concept. Traditional latent analytic approaches have inherent deficits in capturing the complex nature of the concept; however, the Grade of Membership (GoM) model is well suited for this problem. We applied the GoM method to a set of 31 indicators to construct ideal profiles of health status based on physical, mental and social support items among 848 adult twins from Qingdao, China. Four profiles were identified: healthy individuals (pure type I), individuals with personality disorders (pure type II), individuals with mental impairments (pure type III) and individuals with physical impairments (pure type IV). The most frequently occurring combination in this population was profiles I, II, IV (14.74%), followed by profiles I, II, III, IV (13.44%), and then type I (11.08%). Only 13.56% of subjects fell completely into one single pure type, most individuals exhibited some of the characteristics of two or more pure types. Our results indicated that, compared to conventional statistical methods, the GoM model was more suited to capture the complex concept of health, reflecting its multidimensionality and continuity, while also exhibiting preferable reliability. This study also made an important contribution to research on GoM application in non-independent samples.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is unique in that its criteria are embedded with a presumed causal agent, viz, a traumatic event. This assumption has come under scrutiny as a number of recent studies have suggested that many symptoms of PTSD may not necessarily be the result of trauma and may merely represent general psychiatric symptoms that would have existed even in the absence of a trauma event but are subsequently misattributed to it. The current study tests this hypothesis.\nA case-control twin study conducted between 1996-2001 examined psychopathologic symptoms in a national convenience sample of 104 identical twin pairs discordant for combat exposure in Vietnam, with (n = 50) or without (n = 54) combat-related PTSD (DSM-IV-diagnosed) in the exposed twin. Psychometric measures used were the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, and the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD. If a psychopathologic feature represents a factor that would have existed even without traumatic exposure, then there is a high chance that it would also be found at elevated rates in the non-trauma-exposed, identical cotwins of trauma-exposed twins with PTSD. In contrast, if a psychopathologic feature is acquired as a result of an environmental factor unique to the exposed twin, eg, the traumatic event, their cotwins should not have an increased incidence of the feature.\nCombat veterans with PTSD demonstrated significantly higher scores (P < .0001) on the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised and other psychometric measures of psychopathology than their own combat-unexposed cotwins (and than combat veterans without PTSD and their cotwins).\nThese results support the conclusion that the majority of psychiatric symptoms reported by combat veterans with PTSD would not have been present were it not for their exposure to traumatic events.",

    "abstract": "Tibial hemimelia, a rare congenital anomaly, is characterized by deficiency of the tibia with relatively intact fibula. The incidence of congenital deficiency of the tibia is approximately 1 per 1 million live births. The percentage of monozygotic twins is 0.8% of all newborns. Therefore, the occurrence of tibial hemimelia in monozygotic twins is 1 case per 125 million. The purpose of this article is to present a case of identical twins, in which 1 had tibial hemimelia, a double metatarsal bone and preaxial polydactyly and the other had no alterations. The patient that was affected had an anomaly in the left leg and foot. She had 7 fingers in her left foot and a left duplicated great toe. Her legs had a 3-cm difference in length, rigid inversion, adduction of feet, and severe bowing. A roentgenogram showed right tibial hemimelia with intact fibula corresponding to Jones type 3 and the first metacarpo was duplicated with a proximal osseus synostosis. Karyotyping confirmed that the twins were monozygotic. Only 1 of the identical twins had tibial hemimelia, a double metatarsal bone, and preaxial polydactyly. Congenital defects may result from aberrations in the developmental stage, the growth stage, or both. Hemimelia may result from a primary failure to form an anlage, or a primary failure to chronologically synthesize collagen. This case shows that tibial hemimelia can have variable phenotypic manifestations.",

    "abstract": "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune chronic cholestatic liver disease with a strong genetic susceptibility due to the high concordance in monozygotic (MZ) twins and a striking female predominance. Women with PBC manifest an enhanced X monosomy rate in peripheral lymphocytes and we thus hypothesized an X chromosome epigenetic component to explain PBC female prevalence. While most genes on the female inactive X chromosome are silenced by promoter methylation following X chromosome inactivation (XCI), approximately 10% of X- linked genes exhibit variable escape from XCI in healthy females. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that susceptibility to PBC is modified by one or more X-linked gene with variable XCI status. Peripheral blood mRNA and DNA samples were obtained from a unique cohort of MZ twin sets discordant and concordant for PBC. Transcript levels of the 125 variable XCI status genes was determined by quantitative RT-PCR analysis and two genes (CLIC2 and PIN4) were identified as consistently downregulated in the affected twin of discordant pairs. Both CLIC2 and PIN4 demonstrated partial and variable methylation of CpG sites within 300 bp of the transcription start site that did not predict the XCI status. Promoter methylation of CLIC2 manifested no significant difference between samples and no significant correlation with transcript levels. PIN4 methylation showed a positive trend with transcription in all samples but no differential methylation was observed between discordant twins. A genetic polymorphism affecting the number of CpG sites in the PIN4 promoter did not impact methylation or transcript levels in a heterozygous twin pair and showed a similar frequency in independent series of unrelated PBC cases and controls. Our results suggest that epigenetic factors influencing PBC onset are more complex than methylation differences at X-linked promoters and variably 3 inactivated X-linked genes may be characterized by partial promoter methylation and biallelic transcription.",

All the separated babies survived the procedure and remained healthy, both physically and mentally, after discharge.

    "abstract": "The influence of genetics in inflammatory bowel disease is emphasized by twin concordance. Previous studies have methodological limitations. The aims were to establish reliable concordance rates and compare phenotypic characteristics in concordant and discordant monozygotic pairs, anticipating the former reflects a genetically determined subgroup.\nBy re-running the Swedish twin registry with the Swedish hospital discharge register, observation time was extended. Diagnoses and phenotype were based on medical notes. Pairs with unknown zygosity and where both twins were not alive or not responding to the questionnaire were excluded. In all, 149 new twin pairs of the same sex, born 1909-1980 were identified.\nOf new pairs, 4/29 monozygotic, 0/38 dizygotic, and 0/1 twin pairs with unknown zygosity were concordant for Crohn's disease (CD). In ulcerative colitis (UC), 4/31 monozygotic, 4/48 dizygotic, and 0/1 twin pairs with unknown zygosity were concordant. New pairs were added to the original cohort. Restricting analyses to pairs born 1886-1958, the time period used in the original cohort, 9/33 monozygotic and 1/50 dizygotic pairs were concordant for CD (P = 0.008), 6/41 and 3/49, correspondingly, for UC (P = 0.29). There was a trend for concordant twins to have less colonic CD than discordant twins, 15% versus 35% (P = 0.09) in twins born 1886-1980.\nPrevious twin studies have overestimated the influence of genetics in CD. A trend for phenotypic difference between concordant and discordant pairs was observed, suggesting that the clinical entity represents diseases with different pathophysiological backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins occur at the rate of 1 in 50 to 200,000 live births, and 75% of these share the thorax (thoracopagus) or the thorax and upper abdomen (thoraco-omphalopagus), resulting in cardiac and hepatic sharing. Antenatal diagnosis can delineate the cardiac anatomy and provide parental counseling on whether separation is possible after birth. In the majority of cases, thoracopagus twins have a complex cardiac anatomy and share a common pericardial sac. Separation and survival depend on the extent to which the cardiac chambers and conduction system are fused. When the twins share the atria, ventricles, or both, death is inevitable even if surgical separation is occasionally attempted.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies have indicated abnormalities in cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder compared with controls. However, there are inconsistencies between studies regarding the exact set of brain structures involved and the direction of anatomical and functional changes. These inconsistencies may reflect the differential impact of environmental and genetic risk factors for obsessive-compulsive disorder on different parts of the brain. To distinguish between functional brain changes underlying environmentally and genetically mediated obsessive-compulsive disorder, we compared task performance and brain activation during a Tower of London planning paradigm in monozygotic twins discordant (n=38) or concordant (n=100) for obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Twins who score high on obsessive-compulsive symptoms can be considered at high risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder. We found that subjects at high risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder did not differ from the low-risk subjects behaviourally, but we obtained evidence that the high-risk subjects differed from the low-risk subjects in the patterns of brain activation accompanying task execution. These regions can be separated into those that were affected by mainly environmental risk (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lingual cortex), genetic risk (frontopolar cortex, inferior frontal cortex, globus pallidus and caudate nucleus) and regions affected by both environmental and genetic risk factors (cingulate cortex, premotor cortex and parts of the parietal cortex). Our results suggest that neurobiological changes related to obsessive-compulsive symptoms induced by environmental factors involve primarily the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas neurobiological changes induced by genetic factors involve orbitofrontal-basal ganglia structures. Regions showing similar changes in high-risk twins from discordant and concordant pairs may be part of compensatory networks that keep planning performance intact, in spite of cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical deficits.",

    "abstract": "The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is thought to have an important role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Interindividual variation and an inability to detect less abundant bacteria have made it difficult to correlate specific bacteria with disease.\nWe used 454 pyrotag sequencing to determine the compositions of microbial communities in feces samples collected from a cohort of 40 twin pairs who were concordant or discordant for CD or UC, and in mucosal samples from a subset of the cohort. The cohort primarily comprised patients who were in remission, but also some with active disease.\nThe profiles of the microbial community differed with disease phenotypes; relative amounts of bacterial populations correlated with IBD phenotypes. The microbial compositions of individuals with CD differed from those of healthy individuals, but were similar between healthy individuals and individuals with UC. Profiles from individuals with CD that predominantly involved the ileum differed from those with CD that predominantly involved the colon; several bacterial populations increased or decreased with disease type. Changes specific to patients with ileal CD included the disappearance of core bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, and increased amounts of Enterobacteriaceae and Ruminococcus gnavus.\nBacterial populations differ in abundance among individuals with different phenotypes of CD. Specific species of bacteria are associated with ileal CD; further studies should investigate their role in pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to investigate the growth of monozygotic twins with discordant birth weights and the predictive value of birth-weight, birth-length, and cord-blood concentration of growth factors on their catch-up growth up to the age of 4 yr.\nTwenty-five monozygotic twin-pairs [14 with an intertwin birth-weight sd score (SDS) difference>1] were studied at birth and at 4 yr of age. In all pairs, several parameters including IGF-I were analyzed in cord blood, and in 20 pairs parameters were analyzed again at 4 yr of age. Intertwin differences (\u0394) in birth weight, birth length, and growth at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 months were correlated with \u0394 of the parameters analyzed.\nWe found a reduction of \u0394 height SDS from birth to 4 yr, with the main catch-up occurring during the first year, but only a slight, statistically insignificant reduction of \u0394 body mass index SDS during the observation period. Correlation coefficients were used to identify factors predicting postnatal catch-up growth. Both birth-weight difference (r=0.653; P=0.001) and \u0394 IGF-I in cord blood (r=0.613; P=0.007) were of similar predictive value. Variance analysis showed no significant difference in individual impact between these two parameters, although both correlated strongly with actual height.\nWe observed a gradual convergence in height but not body mass index up to the age of 4 yr between genetically identical twins with discordant birth weights. Both birth-weight and cord-blood IGF-I are predictive of subsequent catch-up growth.",

    "abstract": "In last years, owing to the widespread availability of assisted-reproduction technology, multiple pregnancy rates in Western countries have increased. In twin pregnancies, an increased rate of gestational complications, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm birth and severe perinatal conditions is present. These complications are more frequent in monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins as well as an increased relative risk of chromosomal abnormalities and congenital malformation. Monochorionic twins are at higher risk for complications, since they share a common placenta where an imbalance in unidirectional arteriovenous anastomoses can lead to twin&#x2013;twin transfusion syndrome. This extremely dangerous condition, if not early identified, can determine severe fetal complications with mortality rates that, in case of no treatment, reaches 90%. Laser photocoagulation is the treatment of choice in severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome with high survival rate. IUGR occurs more frequently in MC twins and along with prematurity and perinatal pathology is considered an important determinant of developmental delay.",

    "abstract": "Our objective in this Danish population-based cohort study was to estimate the recurrence risk of isolated oral cleft (OC) for offspring of the unaffected co-twins of OC discordant twin pairs and to compare this risk to the recurrence risk in the offspring of the affected co-twin as well as to the risk in the background population. During 1936-2004, 207 twin pairs were ascertained, among whom at least one twin had an OC. The index persons were twins discordant for OC who had children (N=117), and their offspring (N=239). The participants were ascertained by linkage between The Danish Facial Cleft Database, The Danish Twin Registry and The Danish Civil Registration System. In the study OC recurrence risk for offspring of the affected and unaffected twin and relative risk were compared to the background prevalence. We found that among 110 children of the 54 OC affected twins, two (1.8%) children had OC corresponding to a significantly increased relative risk (RR=10; 95% CI 1.2-35) when compared to the frequency in the background population. Among the 129 children of the 63 unaffected twins, three (2.3%) children were affected, corresponding to a significantly increased relative risk (RR=13; 95% CI 2.6-36) when compared the background prevalence. We concluded that in OC discordant twin pairs similar increased recurrence risks were found among offspring of both OC affected and OC unaffected twins. This provides further evidence for a genetic component in cleft etiology and is useful information for genetic counseling of twin pairs discordant for clefting.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of chimaerism occurs in the majority of cattle twin pregnancies. The objectives of this study were to develop a powerful diagnostic test for chimaerism in bovine male and female co-twins using X and Y chromosome-linked markers and to determine the extent of chimaerism in twins, triplets and quadruplets. We developed a multiplex PCR set of three polymorphic markers on chromosome X (DIK2865, DIK2283, AGLA257), where the presence of >1 and >2 alleles per marker is sufficient to prove chimaerism in males and females, respectively. In addition, a specific segment on chromosome Y (BOV97M) is included in the set to indicate chimaerism in females. Visualization of chimaeric alleles was best for DNA extracted from blood, fair for DNA from vaginal smears and failed for DNA extracted from hair. The power of chimaerism identification using this set of markers for DNA extracted from blood was calculated as 99% in males and virtually 100% in females. All females and males in heterosexual twins, triplets and quadruplets displayed evidence of a chimaeric allele in at least one and maximum of three of three X chromosome markers analysed. In addition, all females showed the presence of the BOV97M segment and were validated as chimaeric by the standard clinical diagnosis of impaired vaginal length. Quantitative PCR analysis of BOV97M copies in all twins vs. their sires showed a mean ratio of 45-68% in females and 39-49% in males, indicating a substantial symmetrical exchange of cells among all co-twins. The proposed analysis of X and Y chromosome-linked markers is advantageous to previous methods based on Y chromosome sequences only, because it detects chimaerism in both male and female co-twins.",

Both twins are heterozygous carriers of sickle cell disease mutation. Genotyping of blood DNA from both twins using Illumina Human 610 SNP array revealed a copy number imbalance for chromosome X in a proportion of cells in one twin. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis confirmed monosomy X (45,X) in 7% of proband nucleated blood cells. Unexpectedly, FISH analysis of cells from the other twin revealed 45,X and 46,XY lineages, both present in 1% of cells. The mechanism behind formation of these aneuploidies suggests several aberrant chromosome segregation events in meiosis and mitoses following conception. Our report contributes to the delineation of the frequency of somatic structural genomic variation in normal MZ twins. These results also illustrate the plasticity of the human genome for tolerating large copy number changes in healthy subjects and show the sensitivity of the Illumina platform for detection of aberrations that are present in a minority of the studied cells.",

    "abstract": "The rate of twin pregnancies in the United States has stabilized at 32 per 1000 births in 2006. Aside from determining chorionicity, first-trimester screening and second-trimester ultrasound scanning should ascertain whether there are structural or chromosomal abnormalities. Compared with singleton births, genetic amniocentesis-related loss at <24 weeks of gestation for twin births is higher (0.9% vs 2.9%, respectively). Selective termination for an anomalous fetus is an option, although the pregnancy loss rate is 7% at experienced centers. For singleton and twin births for African American and white women, approximately 50% of preterm births are indicated; approximately one-third of these births are spontaneous, and 10% of the births occur after preterm premature rupture of membranes. From 1989-2000, the rate of preterm twin births increased, for African American and white women alike, although the perinatal mortality rate has actually decreased. As with singleton births, tocolytics should be used judiciously and only for a limited time (<48 hours) in twin births. Administration of antenatal corticosteroids is an evidence-based recommendation.",

    "abstract": "Loss of renal function is accompanied by a progressive increase in markers of inflammation; it is unknown whether they share common genetic pathways.\nWe evaluated the shared heritability of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and markers of inflammation and endothelial activation in 524 twin males from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry; 9 twins were excluded due to incomplete or incorrect data. Models were adjusted for age, race, body mass index, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior coronary artery disease and intercurrent medications.\nThe mean eGFR was 89 \u00b1 13 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2 (range 35-146); eGFR, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and TNF-\u03b1 receptor (TNF-\u03b1R) were moderately heritable (all \u223c50%), while IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and P-selectin were highly heritable (68 and 76%, respectively). IL-6R and TNF-\u03b1R showed a significant inverse association with eGFR (p = 0.04 and p < 0.0001) while the association with ICAM and P-selectin was direct (p = 0.001 and p = 0.06). Bivariate structural equation models showed that the association between eGFR and biomarkers was due to unique environmental factors and there were no shared genetic pathways.\nWe found no shared genetic pathways between renal function and inflammation. Thus, increased inflammation represents a response to declining renal function rather than being a mechanism contributing to renal deterioration.",

    "abstract": "Mass screening for cervical cancer precursors has decreased the incidence of cervical cancer in several countries, including the Netherlands. Persistent infections of certain types of human papillomavirus are strongly associated with the development of cervical cancer. A number of factors may affect the liability to infection and subsequent progression to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer. This paper examines whether genetic factors are involved in explaining individual differences in liability. Data of 3178 women registered with the Netherlands Twin Register were successfully linked to the nationwide Dutch Pathology database that contains all results of mass screening for cervical cancer. The data from mono- and dizygotic twins and their female relatives were used to disentangle the influence of heritable and environmental factors on cervix smear abnormalities. Results showed that differences in cervix smear results clustered within families and resemblance was stronger in monozygotic twins (correlation 0.37, 95% confidence interval: 0.12-0.58) compared with other first-degree relatives (correlation 0.14, 95% confidence interval: -0.01-0.29). The familial clustering for an abnormal cervix smear is due to shared genetic factors that explain 37% of the variance in liability. The largest proportion of the variation in cervical smear abnormalities is due to unique environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "We examined the variation and heritability of DSM-IV nicotine withdrawal (NW) in adult and adolescent male and female twin cigarette smokers (who reported smoking 100 or more cigarettes lifetime). Telephone diagnostic interviews were completed with 3,112 Australian adult male and female smokers (53% women; age: 24-36) and 702 Missouri adolescent male and female smokers (59% girls; age: 15-21). No gender or cohort differences emerged in rates of meeting criteria for NW (44%). Latent class analyses found that NW symptoms were best conceptualized as a severity continuum (three levels in adults and two levels in adolescents). Across all groups, increasing NW severity was associated with difficulty quitting, impairment following cessation, heavy smoking, depression, anxiety, conduct disorder and problems with alcohol use. NW was also associated with seeking smoking cessation treatment and with smoking persistence in adults. The latent class structure of NW was equally heritable across adult and adolescent smokers with additive genetic influences accounting for 49% of the variance and the remaining 51% of variance accounted for by unique environmental influences. Overall, findings suggest remarkable similarity in the pattern and heritability of NW across adult and adolescent smokers, and highlight the important role of NW in psychiatric comorbidity and the process of smoking cessation across both age groups.",

    "abstract": "Optimism has a positive influence on mental and somatic health throughout lifetime and into old age. This association is mainly due to shared genetic influences, with some indication of sex differences in the heritability of these and related traits (e.g., depression and subjective wellbeing). Here we extend our initial study of Australian twins by combining with data available from Swedish twins, in order to increase the power to explore potential sex differences in the genetic architecture of optimism, mental and self-rated health and their covariation. Optimism, mental, and self-rated health were measured in 3053 Australian (501 identical female (MZf), 153 identical male (MZm), 274 non-identical female (DZf), 77 non-identical male (DZm), and 242 non-identical opposite-sex twin pairs, and 561 single twins; mean age 60.97 +/- 8.76), and 812 Swedish (71 MZf, 53 MZm, 93 DZf and 67 DZm twin pairs, and 244 single twins; mean age 60 +/- 14.3) twin individuals using the Life Orientation Test (LOT), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and a single-item self-rating of overall health, respectively. In females all three traits were moderately heritable (.27-.47), whereas in males heritability was substantially lower (.08-.19), but genetic modeling showed that sex differences were not significant. The absence of significant sex differences, despite the consistent trend across the two cohorts, is likely due to a lack of power, raising the importance for future studies, on the same or similar traits, to utilize large samples and to keep the possibility of sex differences in mind when conducting their analyses.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate whether baseline physical activity protects against the occurrence of type 2 diabetes during a 28 year follow-up, after controlling for childhood environment and genetic predisposition.\nAt baseline in 1975 same-sex twin pairs born in Finland before 1958 were sent a questionnaire including questions on physical activity. The participants (20,487 individuals, including 8,182 complete twin pairs) were divided into quintiles by leisure-time physical activity metabolic equivalent (MET) index (MET h/day). Type 2 diabetes was determined from nationwide registers for the follow-up period (1 January 1976-31 December 2004). Individual and pairwise Cox proportional hazard models were used.\nDuring follow-up, 1,082 type 2 diabetes cases were observed. Among all individuals, participants in MET quintiles (Q) III-V had significantly decreased risk for type 2 diabetes compared with sedentary individuals (QI). The pairwise analysis on pairs discordant for physical activity showed that participants in MET QII to V had significantly lower hazard ratios (0.61, 0.59, 0.61, 0.61) compared with sedentary participants. These findings from the pairwise analysis persisted after adjusting for BMI. In the pairwise analysis, the BMI-adjusted hazard ratio for type 2 diabetes was lower for physically active members of twin pairs (combined QII-V) than for inactive co-twins (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.37-0.78). Similar results were obtained for both dizygotic and monozygotic pairs, as well as for the subgroup of twin pairs defined as free of co-morbidities in 1981 (HR 0.36; 95% CI 0.17-0.76).\nLeisure-time physical activity protects from type 2 diabetes after taking familial and genetic effects into account.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the incidence of perinatal morbidity and mortality in late pre-term and term dichorionic twins versus singleton delivery at the same gestation. There were no measurable differences in the incidence of the perinatal complications in relation to gestational age at delivery between singleton and dichorionic twin pregnancies. In singleton pregnancies, the incidence of RDS/TTN in late pre-term births are significantly higher than those at 37 weeks, while the incidence in births at 39-40 weeks are significantly lower than those at 37 weeks. In dichorionic twin pregnancies, the incidence of RDS/TTN in late pre-term births are significantly higher than those at 37 weeks, while there were no measurable differences in the incidence in births between 37 and 38-39 weeks' gestation. There were no cases of fetal demise in dichorionic twin pregnancies at 36-40 weeks' gestation. Although fetuses in dichorionic twin pregnancies may achieve maturity earlier than fetuses in singleton pregnancies at 37-40 weeks' gestation, the incidence of perinatal complications such as RDS/TTN of late pre-term births in dichorionic twin pregnancies was the same as that in singleton pregnancies. In the absence of maternal or fetal complications, it is advisable to deliver twins only at 37 completed weeks' gestation or later, to avoid neonatal complications.",

    "abstract": "Early neonatal biochemical values are generally considered to reflect maternal values. However, studies have been inconclusive due to the statistical methods used. We hypothesized that there would not be important differences in plasma biochemistry between newborn twins, suggesting a common mechanism of control, and that differences between unrelated infant pairs would be greater. All twins over a 5-year period who had plasma biochemistry measured within 6 hours of birth were identified retrospectively. An unrelated control infant was matched to one of each twin pair. The 95% limits of agreement for plasma urea, creatinine, and sodium were calculated for twin pairs and unrelated matched infant pairs. Fifty-three twin pairs were studied. For urea, creatinine, and sodium, 95% of differences between twins were less than or equal to 1.5 mmol/L (8.9 mg/dL), 9.2 \u03bcmol/L (0.1 mg/dL), and 5.1 mmol/L (11.7 mg/dL), respectively. In unrelated infant pairs, the corresponding values were 4.0 mmol/L (24.3 mg/dL), 33.9 \u03bcmol/L (0.4 mg/dL), and 8.2 mmol/L (18.9 mg/dL). Differences between unrelated infant pairs were significantly wider than differences between twins ( p < 0.001). This study has demonstrated a close and significant agreement in urea, sodium, and creatinine when measured soon after birth in twin pairs compared with unrelated infants, implying a common mechanism of control.",

One embryo euploid for studied chromosomes was transferred. Prenatal ultrasonography revealed monozygotic twins. One fetus had growth retardation, multiple organ abnormalities and polyhydramnion. The other twin had normal ultrasound appearance. Delivery on week 29 of gestation resulted in the birth of two females, a stillborn twin with karyotype 45,XX,-13[12]/46,XX,r(13)[3] and a healthy twin with normal karyotype.\nthe discordance in the twins' karyotypes originated from a mosaic embryo. Structural chromosomal abnormality of the affected twin could not be revealed using standard PGS investigation. Embryo splitting occurred probably due to apoptotic process in an early stage of embryo development. Apoptosis represents one of the possible mechanisms which can explain the embryo twinning process globally.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence from both animal and human studies suggests that the epigenome is in constant drift over the life course in response to stochastic and environmental factors. In humans, this has been highlighted by a small number of studies that have demonstrated discordant DNA methylation patterns in adolescent or adult monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs. However, to date, it remains unclear when such differences emerge, and how prevalent they are across different tissues. To address this, we examined the methylation of four differentially methylated regions associated with the IGF2/H19 locus in multiple birth tissues derived from 91 twin pairs: 56 MZ and 35 dizygotic (DZ). Tissues included cord blood-derived mononuclear cells and granulocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, buccal epithelial cells and placental tissue. Considerable variation in DNA methylation was observed between tissues and between unrelated individuals. Most interestingly, methylation discordance was also present within twin pairs, with DZ pairs showing greater discordance than MZ pairs. These data highlight the variable contribution of both intrauterine environmental exposures and underlying genetic factors to the establishment of the neonatal epigenome of different tissues and confirm the intrauterine period as a sensitive time for the establishment of epigenetic variability in humans. This has implications for the effects of maternal environment on the development of the newborn epigenome and supports an epigenetic mechanism for the previously described phenomenon of 'fetal programming' of disease risk.",

    "abstract": "Psychopathic personality is characterized by interpersonal dominance, impulsivity, sensation seeking, poor planning, and aggressiveness. Studies have shown that the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) can be used to estimate scores on the fearless-dominant (FD) and the impulsive-antisocial (IA) dimensions of the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI), the best validated self-report measure of psychopathic personality traits. Prior behavior genetic studies reported roughly equal genetic and nonshared environmental influences for both FD and IA, which remained stable from adolescence to young adulthood. However, no prior studies address genetic and environmental influences on these dimensions beyond early adulthood. We utilized the classic twin method to examine genetic and environmental influences on variance in FD and IA in a sample of middle-aged male twins. Biometric modeling indicated that the variance in both factors is best explained by additive genetic and nonshared environmental influences. FD showed roughly equal contributions from genetic and environmental factors, whereas IA showed greater contributions from environmental than genetic factors. Additionally, the small phenotypic correlation between FD and IA was explained entirely by nonshared environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "T helper (Th) cell subsets secrete cytokines that regulate other immune cells. Interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 belong to a new class of cytokines with predominant effects on epithelial cells. Thus, these cytokines are key molecules in several disease processes. IL-17 and IL-22 are released by leukocytes such as Th and natural killer cell populations. Both IL-17 and IL-22 induce an innate immune response in epithelial cells, but their functional spectra are generally distinct. IL-17 induces an inflammatory tissue response and is involved in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, whereas IL-22 is protective/regenerative. This review juxtaposes IL-17 and IL-22 and describes overlaps and differences regarding their cellular sources, biochemical structure, signaling cascades in target cells, and function.",

The concordances and discordances of the clinical features of the twins were determined. Genomic DNA was extracted and genotyped for three established PCV risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, viz CFH I62V, CFH Y402H, and ARMS A69S.\nBoth patients had hemorrhagic pigment epithelial detachments with orange lesions beneath the retinal pigment epithelium.

Both twins were treated with photodynamic therapy, retinal photocoagulation, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, but both showed limited response to all the treatments, with recurrent exudative lesions with enlarged vascular network, and poor visual outcome. Genetic analyses showed that both sisters had homozygous risk alleles for ARMS2 A69S, and one risk allele each of CFH I62V and CFH Y402H.\nWe present the first findings in a set of monozygotic twins with typical PCV under long-term observation. The concordances in disease progression and response to treatment between the twins indicate that these genetic factors most likely played important roles in determining the clinical manifestations.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a common autosomal dominant disorder with full penetrance and variable expression. The condition predisposes individuals to the development of malignant nervous system tumours, most frequently Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumours (MPNSTs). Previous studies indicate that genetic factors other than mutations in NF1 may be responsible for the condition's variable expression.\nHere we present data from a pair of monozygotic twins affected by Neurofibromatosis type 1 resulting from a de novo mutation. Both twins developed a left sciatic plexiform neurofibroma that evolved into MPNST at a similar age and they also developed pulmonary metastasis at the same age. Other concordant traits between the twins were: macrocephaly, psychomotor delay, caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, cutaneous neurofibromas, retroperitoneal, pleural and paraspinal neurofibromas. The main discordant features observed were tibial pseudoarthrosis, pectus carinatum, osteoporosis and thymus hyperplasia.\nThis is the first report of monozygotic twins with Neurofibromatosis type 1 that develop MPNSTs, the localization and chronological evolution of which, and its metastasis, is concordant in both twins. These cases suggest that the events involved in the transformation of benign plexiform neurofibromas to MPNSTs in Neurofibromatosis type 1, follow a spatiotemporally programme that is influenced by heritable factors other than NF1 mutations.",

    "abstract": "Case 1 was a 22-year-old younger sister of identical twins who had smoked 10 cigarettes per day for 4 years since she was 18. She was admitted to our hospital due to dyspnea on exertion, dry cough and bilateral diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates on chest computed tomography (CT). Histological findings of transbronchial lung biopsy demonstrated nodular lesions consisting of spindle-shaped mononuclear cells. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the cytoplasm of these mononuclear cells showed positive reactions to CD1a. Based on these findings, she was given a diagnosis of pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). She reduced the number of cigarettes smoked to 1 cigarette per week. After 6 months, her respiratory symptoms and radiographic abnormalities had improved. Case 2 was the elder twin sister of case 1. She had smoked 5 cigarettes per day for 4 years since she was 18. She presented no respiratory symptoms. However, as the diagnosis in case 1 was LCH, a chest CT was taken which revealed 3 small nodular lesions. After six months, there were no significant changes on chest CT. At the time of writing, she is 23-years-old and continues to smoke, however, has no respiratory symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The rate of mortality during the surgical separation of conjoined twins in the neonatal period is 50% and can reach up to 75% if it occurs in emergency situations. The planning of the surgical separation procedure is detailed and involves imaging assessment, evaluation of cross-circulation and even other surgical preparation procedures, such as skin expansion.\nEleven-day-old female omphalopagus conjoined twins underwent emergency surgical separation due to the death of one twin caused by sepsis associated to cardiopathy. The liver was shared by the twins and was separated. The surviving twin died six days later.\nSurgical separation of conjoined twins in the neonatal period must be avoided due to the patients' organic system immaturity. However, emergency situations such as the one described herein can require the procedure to be carried out.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to find out whether persistent leisure-time physical activity, adjusted for genetic liability and childhood experiences, protect against occurrence of specific chronic diseases and all-cause mortality. Study design was a 24-year prospective follow-up after 6-year physical activity discordance in twin pairs. From 5,663 healthy adult twin pairs, 146 pairs (including 29 mozygotic) discordant for both intensity and volume of leisure physical activity at baseline in both 1975 and 1981 were systematically identified. Mortality and occurrence of chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease defined according to reimbursable medication status) were followed for the period 1.1.1983-31.12.2006 for mortality and 1.1.1983-31.12.2004 for diseases. By end of follow-up, 19 inactive and 10 active co-twins had died. In the whole sample, HR of death adjusted for social class was 2.08 (95% CI 1.06-4.09) for inactive vs. active co-twins, the HR being 2.67 (95% CI 1.15-6.20) among DZ pairs with no mortality difference among the smaller number of discordant MZ pairs. The reimbursable medication analyses showed a tendency of higher risk for inactive vs. active co-twins. Among DZ pairs, HR of diabetes medication adjusted for social class was 2.73 (95% CI 0.62-12.00) and HR of hypertension medication was 2.14 (95% CI 0.94-4.89). This study supports the earlier findings that physical activity is associated with reduced mortality. However the difference was seen only in DZ pairs and therefore some residual genetic confounding effects on mortality cannot be excluded.",

    "abstract": "Selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) in monochorionic twins is associated with a substantial increase in perinatal mortality and morbidity for both twins. Clinical evolution depends on the combination of the effects of placental insufficiency in the IUGR twin with inter-twin blood transfer through placental anastomoses. Classification of sIUGR into types according to the characteristics of umbilical artery diastolic flow in the IUGR twin permits the differentiation of clinical and prognostic groups. sIUGR type I has normal diastolic flow and relatively good outcome. Type II is defined by persistently absent/reverse end-diastolic flow and is associated with a high risk of intrauterine demise of the IUGR twin and/or very preterm delivery. Type III is defined by the presence of intermittent absent/reverse end-diastolic flow (iAREDF), and is associated with 10-20% risk of unexpected fetal demise of the smaller twin and 10-20% risk of neurological injury in the larger twin. The management strategy for sIUGR with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler (types II and III) remains a challenge, and may include elective fetal therapy or close surveillance with fetal therapy or elective delivery in the presence of severe fetal deterioration. Small clinical series reporting the use of cord occlusion or laser therapy in severe cases suggest that the outcome of the larger twin might be improved. There is probably no single optimal strategy, since decisions will ultimately be influenced by the severity of IUGR, gestational age, parents' wishes and technical issues.",

    "abstract": "This study presents the first case of internal root resorption in monozygotic twins. Genetic factors have been implicated in the development of root resorption lesions. The link between interleukin (IL)-1 gene polymorphism and root resorption had been reported. However, these studies have involved external root resorption. Twin healthy 17 year old Caucasian sisters were diagnosed with internal root resorption in their upper left central incisor. Neither had a history of orofacial trauma and neither had received orthodontic treatment. The presence of IL-1beta+C3953 allele is the sign of predisposed susceptibility to an exaggerated inflammatory response, including a limited feedback mechanism as a consequence of IL-1RN mutation. Most investigators agree that the listed polymorphism presents a significantly higher risk for development of pathological resorption. These were thought to be cases of true idiopathic resorption as none of the other factors related to root resorption was found.",

    "abstract": "It has been accepted practice to use yolk-sac number to predict amnionicity in twin pairs. Two yolk sacs in a single chorionic sac were thought to confirm diamniotic pregnancy, and a single yolk sac with two fetal poles was thought to indicate monoamniotic twins. Thus, basic ultrasonography could confirm amnionicity early in pregnancy and avoid invasive testing or the more difficult tasks of demonstrating the absence of a dividing membrane or presence of entwined cords later in the pregnancy.\nWe present a case of monoamniotic twin gestation in which early ultrasonography confirmed the presence of two yolk sacs. Doppler showed entwined umbilical cords. After elective cesarean delivery, the twins did well in the neonatal intensive care unit and continue to thrive.\nYolk-sac number does not predict amnionicity. The diagnosis of monoamniotic twins requires demonstration of entwined cords or an invasive procedure.",

    "abstract": "Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is a monogenic channelopathy caused by mutations of the potassium channel gene KCNA1. Affected individuals carrying the same mutation can exhibit considerable variability in the severity of ataxia, neuromyotonia, and other associated features. We investigated the phenotypic heterogeneity of EA1 in 2 sets of identical twins to determine the contribution of environmental factors to disease severity. One of the mutations was also found in a distantly related family, providing evidence of the influence of genetic background on the EA1 phenotype.\nWe evaluated 3 families with an EA1 phenotype, 2 of which included monozygotic twins. We sequenced the KCNA1 gene and studied the biophysical consequences of the mutations in HEK cells.\nWe identified a new KCNA1 mutation in each pair of twins. Both pairs reported striking differences in the clinical severity of symptoms. The F414S mutation identified in one set of twins also occurred in a distantly related family in which seizures complicated the EA1 phenotype. The other twins had an R307C mutation, the first EA1 mutation to affect an arginine residue in the voltage-sensor domain. Both mutants when expressed exerted a dominant-negative effect on wild-type channels.\nThese results broaden the range of KCNA1 mutations and reveal an unexpectedly large contribution of nongenetic factors to phenotypic variability in EA1. The occurrence of epilepsy in 1 of 2 families with the F414S mutation suggests an interplay of KCNA1 with other genetic factors.",

Medical, dental, and dietary histories were obtained. The children were examined for DE using a modified index.\nThe prevalence of DE by subject affected was 77% in monozygotic twins (MZ), 74% in dizygotic twins (DZ), and 75% in singleton controls (P > 0.1). Of the teeth scored, 12% had mild, 10% moderate, and 1% severe lesions, and DE was more severe in the older age group (P < 0.05). Concordance rates for erosion lesions in MZ and DZ co-twins were not statistically significant.\nThe prevalence of DE and the concordance of erosion lesions were similar between MZ and DZ twins and singleton children, suggesting that the contribution of genetic factors to DE is negligible.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the extent of concordance in the number of leucocytes and their cytokine secretion after ex vivo stimulation in a twin population discordant for the amount of periodontal breakdown.\nVenous blood was collected from 18 adult twin pairs (10 monozygotic and eight dizygotic twins). Each twin pair consisted of a diseased twin (proband) and his/her co-twin. In venous blood, leucocytes were counted. The cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12p40 were assessed after stimulation of monocytic cells, while IL-13 and interferon (IFN)-gamma were determined after lymphocytic stimulation.\nIn the study population as a whole, probands showed higher total numbers of leucocytes and lower IL-12p40 levels compared with their co-twins. In monozygotic twins, no difference was found in the leucocyte counts, but probands secreted more IL-6 than their co-twins; an opposite trend was found for IL-12p40.\nThe results suggest that the observed discordance in periodontal breakdown in the studied monozygotic twin population may be related to the relatively high levels of IL-6 and the low levels of IL-12p40 secretion after ex vivo stimulation of whole-blood cell cultures. This cytokine secretion profile may be regarded as a risk indicator of periodontitis.",

    "abstract": "Using a sample of 20,445 Dutch twins, this study examined the relationship between speech fluency and attentional regulation in children. A secondary objective was to identify etiological overlap between nonfluency and poor attention using fluency-discordant twin pairs.\nThree fluency groups were created at age 5 using a parent questionnaire: (a) probable stuttering (PS; N=826; 4.0%), highly nonfluent (HNF; N=547; 2.7%), and typically fluent (TF; N=19,072; 93%). Multiple scales assessing attention, primarily self-regulation/inhibition, were obtained from both parents when children were ages 5 and 7 and from teachers when children were age 7.\nWhen compared with the TF controls, both the PS and HNF children received higher (i.e., more problematic) scores on parental attention ratings at both ages (p<.002). Effect sizes were moderate for both groups. Teacher and parent ratings were generally comparable. The discordant co-twin analyses suggested that nonfluency and attention were influenced by potentially overlapping genetic and shared environmental factors.\nThe liability to express both high nonfluency and problems with self-regulation/inhibition may arise from a common set of pathogenic mechanisms. This supports emerging models of stuttering, which propose that poor fluency may be part of a broader network of impaired self-regulatory processes.",

    "abstract": "Studies comparing the outcome of spontaneous versus IVF twin pregnancies report heterogeneous results. This may depend on differences in the studied populations and/or in the management approach to twin pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to compare both maternal and perinatal outcomes in dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies who where spontaneously conceived or originated by successful homologous IVF. In order to get homogeneous observations, monochorionic twin pregnancies and triplet pregnancies were excluded. Moreover, to avoid any possible bias deriving from differences in the obstetric management, all pregnancies were managed by the same team applying fixed obstetric protocols. The study included 223 twin pregnancies, 84 conceived by IVF and 139 spontaneously conceived. Overall, maternal and perinatal outcomes were similar in the two groups: no significant differences were observed as far as gestational age at delivery, birthweight, perinatal morbidity and mortality, and rate of malformations were concerned. The rate of Caesarean section was slightly, but not significantly, higher in IVF pregnancies. In conclusion, the outcome of IVF twin pregnancies is comparable to that of spontaneously conceived twin pregnancies, provided that the same management criteria are applied.",

    "abstract": "To examine the role of heredity in determining flow-mediated dilation in young people by comparing conduit artery endothelial function in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. We also determined relationships between physical activity and fitness in each twin subset.\nFlow-mediated dilation was assessed with high-resolution ultrasonography of the brachial artery in 22 twin pairs (11 monozygotic pairs 13.3 \u00b1 1.6 years, 11 dizygotic pairs 13.6 \u00b1 1.6 years). Fitness was assessed as peak oxygen uptake during an incremental treadmill test. Physical activity was measured with accelerometry. Twin versus twin intraclass correlations were performed for both groups.\nFlow-mediated dilation was significantly correlated in monozygotic twins only (r = 0.60, P = .02). Heritability of flow-mediated dilation was estimated at 0.44. Total PA time (monozygotic r = 0.77, dizygotic r = 0.60, P < .05) and light physical activity time (monozygotic r = 0.67, dizygotic r = 0.63, P < .05) correlated significantly in both groups. The peak oxygen uptake (r = 0.84, P < .01) was correlated only in monozygotic twins.\nGenetic factors appear to be responsible for a modest portion of the flow-mediated dilation response, suggesting that flow-mediated dilation can be influenced by environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Cystic renal disorders generally comprise a heterogeneous group of conditions. The most common genetic form is a polycystic kidney disease. This nosologic entity can be inherited as either an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant trait. Among all cystic renal disorders, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is the most frequent heritable disease manifesting in infancy and childhood and is among those that come to clinical attention early. The characteristic pathologic changes occur in the kidneys and the liver, however, several other organ systems can be affected secondarily. Both kidneys are enlarged because of multiple progressive cystic dilatation of the renal tubules that results to renal failure. The liver is characterized by periportal fibrosis with bile ducts abnormalities. The renal and hepatic manifestations are more or less inversely proportional in individual patients. Therefore, the morphological features and clinical presentation of this disorder can vary substantially. Moreover, there is also a great variability in the severity and manifestations even between individuals from the same family who carry the identical mutations. The authors present a case report of a fatal clinical course of the perinatal congenital polycystic kidney disease in one of the twins (Fig. 4, Ref. 19).",

    "abstract": "To investigate the impact of selective fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (SFLP) on pre-existing pulmonary valve pathology in the recipient twin in twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).\nWe evaluated preoperative echocardiograms of all pregnancies with TTTS treated with SFLP at our institution from 2001 to 2009 (n = 76). Sixteen (21%) recipients had an abnormal pulmonary valve (stenosis/dysplasia, insufficiency or functional atresia) before SFLP. Postoperative echocardiograms and medical records from these 16 recipients were reviewed. Changes in pulmonary valve structure and function, and overall cardiac function, were noted after SFLP.\nThe mean gestational age at SFLP was 21 (range, 18.7-24.3) weeks. Seven of sixteen (44%) recipients with abnormal pulmonary valve prior to SFLP survived. Six of the 16 (37.5%) recipient twins had documented absence of persistent pulmonary valve abnormalities at birth or at autopsy. Two (12.5%) of the 16 recipients (2.6% of the original cohort) had persistent pulmonary valve abnormalities at birth, requiring intervention. Systolic and diastolic function improved or normalized after SFLP in all patients undergoing longitudinal follow-up. There was a tendency for a better cardiovascular profile score (best = 10 points) at initial evaluation in pregnancies with survivors compared with those with no survivors (mean (SD): 5.6 (2.2) vs. 6.75 (1.28)), but this was not statistically significant. Severity of cardiac involvement did not predict persistence of valve pathology or survival.\nSFLP can improve flow through the pulmonary valve of the recipient twin in TTTS, probably as a consequence of improvements in right ventricular systolic and diastolic function. However, pulmonary valve pathology may persist and require postnatal intervention.",

Six of the 16 (37.5%) recipient twins had documented absence of persistent pulmonary valve abnormalities at birth or at autopsy. Two (12.5%) of the 16 recipients (2.6% of the original cohort) had persistent pulmonary valve abnormalities at birth, requiring intervention. Systolic and diastolic function improved or normalized after SFLP in all patients undergoing longitudinal follow-up. There was a tendency for a better cardiovascular profile score (best = 10 points) at initial evaluation in pregnancies with survivors compared with those with no survivors (mean (SD): 5.6 (2.2) vs. 6.75 (1.28)), but this was not statistically significant. Severity of cardiac involvement did not predict persistence of valve pathology or survival.",

    "abstract": "We investigated measurement non-invariance of DSM-IV narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) criteria across age and sex in a population-based cohort sample of 2794 Norwegian twins. Age had a statistically significant effect on the factor mean for NPD. Sex had a statistically significant effect on the factor mean and variance. Controlling for these factor level effects, item-level analysis indicated that the criteria were functioning differently across age and sex. After correcting for measurement differences at the item level, the latent factor mean effect for age was no longer statistically significant. The mean difference for sex remained statistically significant after correcting for item threshold effects. The results indicate that DSM-IV NPD criteria perform differently in males and females and across age. Differences in diagnostic rates across groups may not be valid without correcting for measurement non-invariance.",

    "abstract": "Viral diversity and life cycles are poorly understood in the human gut and other body habitats. Phages and their encoded functions may provide informative signatures of a human microbiota and of microbial community responses to various disturbances, and may indicate whether community health or dysfunction is manifest after apparent recovery from a disease or therapeutic intervention. Here we report sequencing of the viromes (metagenomes) of virus-like particles isolated from faecal samples collected from healthy adult female monozygotic twins and their mothers at three time points over a one-year period. We compared these data sets with data sets of sequenced bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes and total-faecal-community DNA. Co-twins and their mothers share a significantly greater degree of similarity in their faecal bacterial communities than do unrelated individuals. In contrast, viromes are unique to individuals regardless of their degree of genetic relatedness. Despite remarkable interpersonal variations in viromes and their encoded functions, intrapersonal diversity is very low, with >95% of virotypes retained over the period surveyed, and with viromes dominated by a few temperate phages that exhibit remarkable genetic stability. These results indicate that a predatory viral-microbial dynamic, manifest in a number of other characterized environmental ecosystems, is notably absent in the very distal intestine.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the role of genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in brain volumes measured at 2 time points in normal elderly males from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Twin Study. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted 4 years apart on 33 monozygotic and 33 dizygotic male twin pairs, aged 68 to 77 years when first scanned. Volumetric measures of total brain and total cerebrospinal fluid were significantly heritable at baseline (over 70%). For both volumes genetic influences at follow-up were entirely accounted for by genetic influences at baseline, suggesting that the same genetic factors influence variability in brain volume at each time of assessment. Variability in 4-year volume change was due to shared and individual-specific environmental influences. There was little evidence for heritable influences on change measures. These results suggest that variation in longitudinal change of some brain volume measures may have different underlying genetic and environmental architecture from variation in repeat cross-sectional measures, which could have implications for intervention strategies for age-related illness associated with brain morphology. The results of this study are discussed in the context of the small sample size and associated limitations of statistical power.",

Main lifetime occupation was coded according to an established EMF exposure matrix. Covariates were age, gender, education, vascular risk factors, and complexity of work. Based on previous research, data were also analyzed separately for cases with disease onset by age 75 years versus later, men versus women, and those with manual versus nonmanual main occupation. We used generalized estimating equations with the entire sample (to adjust for the inclusion of complete twin pairs) and conditional logistic regression with complete twin pairs only.\nLevel of EMF exposure was not significantly associated with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. However, in stratified analyses, medium and high levels of EMF exposure were associated with increased dementia risk compared with low level in cases with onset by age 75 years (odds ratio: 1.94, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-3.65 for medium, odds ratio: 2.01, 95% confidence interval: 1.10-3.65 for high) and in participants with manual occupations (odds ratio: 1.81, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-3.09 for medium, odds ratio: 1.75, 95% confidence interval: 1.00-3.05 for high). Results with 42 twin pairs discordant for dementia did not reach statistical significance.\nOccupational EMF exposure appears relevant primarily to dementia with an earlier onset and among former manual workers.",

    "abstract": "To determine the accuracy of dating twin pregnancies, of between 16 and 26 weeks' gestation, using singleton head circumference (HC) formulae.\nThis was a retrospective study of 269 singleton and 119 twin non-anomalous pregnancies conceived by in-vitro fertilization (IVF) with a known embryo transfer date. Fetal ultrasound biometry data for HC, obtained using different formulae, were compared with expected fetal HC size for gestation calculated from the date of conception. Similar comparisons were undertaken for femur length (FL) and for transverse cerebellar diameter.\nThe mean differences in HC between observed ultrasound measurements and those expected from the IVF history were small (1-4 mm) and within the measurement error for both singletons and twins for all formulae. All measurements from the larger and the smaller twins straddled those of singletons, regardless of biometry and formula used. Negative skewing of FL measurements in the smaller twin suggests that fetal growth restriction may occur at this gestation and supports the practice of dating using the HC of the larger twin.\nSingleton pregnancy HC charts can be used to date reliably twin pregnancies. The data of the study also suggest that the HC of the larger twin is the most reliable measurement for use in dating.",

    "abstract": "The clinical, electroencephalographic, and genetic findings are reported for three pairs of monozygotic twins who developed infantile spasms in their first year. In all three pairs, the spasms started on the same day in each member of the pair. Neither sequencing of the ARX and CDKL5 (alias STK9) genes nor array comparative genomic hybridization assessment revealed any abnormalities. The long-term outcome was poor in all twins, although with different severity in individual pairs. These findings suggest that genes other than those currently known likely play a role in predisposition to infantile spasms, and that genetic susceptibility is linked to a variable phenotypic expression, ranging from quite benign to very severe, in monozygotic twins with no other apparent risk factors.",

EH has not yet been described in discordant birth weight twins. We report the cases of two sets of discordant twins with normal neonatal course and normal neonatal brain ultrasound scans who developed an EH in the first months after birth and had a mild neurodevelopmental delay. Our findings suggest that EH may be part of neurologic morbidity in discordant birth weight twins and represents one of the potential complications to look for in the follow-up of these infants.",

    "abstract": "The appropriate time and the optimal mode of delivery of twins are still controversial. We assessed the effect of gestational age and the mode of elective delivery of twins on the occurrence of neonatal respiratory morbidity (NRM) and of maternal morbidity. This study included twins born beyond 35 weeks' gestation. NRM was defined as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). Additionally, maternal complications related to the different modes of delivery were taken into account. Of 711 twin pregnancies (1422 liveborn neonates) included, 74 (5.2%) experienced NRM. Maternal age > 25 years, delivery at an earlier gestational age, and delivery by emergency cesarean section maintained statistical significance with NRM. From the maternal point of view, increased length of hospitalization ( P = 0.045) and the need for postoperative antibiotics ( P = 0.0065) were significantly higher following an emergency cesarean section than after an elective cesarean birth. The risk of NRM in twins born beyond 37 weeks' gestation is rather low. We suggest considering elective cesarean delivery at completion of 37 weeks. This can be performed safely in regard to NRM, the trade-off being reduced maternal morbidity associated with elective cesarean delivery.",

    "abstract": "Sudden unexplained and unexpected death in twins has not been well studied, particularly in relation to the common practice of sleeping twin infants together in the same cot (cobedding). Postal surveys of 109 mothers of twins were undertaken when the infants were 6 weeks, 4 months, and 8 months of age to determine the prevalence of cobedding, infant care practices related to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and the mother's knowledge of SIDS risk factors. SIDS risk factor knowledge was similar to an earlier survey of singletons in 2005. At 6 weeks, 76% of infants usually slept on the back; this changed to 86% at 4 months and 73% at 8 months. At 6 weeks, 52% usually cobedded with their twin all or part of the time. At 4 and 8 months, this had reduced to 31% and 10%, respectively. Side-by-side cobedding configurations were predominant at 6 weeks, with feet-to-feet configurations increasing as the infants grew older. Breastfeeding was reported in 83%, 61% and 31% of infants at 6 weeks, 4 months and 8 months, respectively. Pacifier use was reported in 38%, 50% and 33% at the respective surveys. As the age of the twins increased, mothers were significantly more likely to be concerned about deformational plagiocephaly in Twin 1 than in Twin 2.\nDespite a lack of evidence of the risks or benefits of cobedding, this practice was very popular, especially in the younger infants. More research is needed to establish the safety of cobedding in relation to the risk of SIDS.",

    "abstract": "The understanding of the influence of smoking and sex on lung function and symptoms is important for understanding diseases such as COPD. The influence of both genes and environment on lung function, smoking behaviour and the presence of respiratory symptoms has previously been demonstrated for each of these separately. Hence, smoking can influence lung function by co-varying not only as an environmental factor, but also by shared genetic pathways. Therefore, the objective was to evaluate heritability for different aspects of lung function, and to investigate how the estimates are affected by adjustments for smoking and respiratory symptoms.\nThe current study is based on a selected sample of adult twins from the Swedish Twin Registry. Pairs were selected based on background data on smoking and respiratory symptoms collected by telephone interview. Lung function was measured as FEV1, VC and DLco. Pack years were quantified, and quantitative genetic analysis was performed on lung function data adjusting stepwise for sex, pack years and respiratory symptoms.\nFully adjusted heritability for VC was 59% and did not differ by sex, with smoking and symptoms explaining only a small part of the total variance. Heritabilities for FEV1 and DLco were sex specific. Fully adjusted estimates were 10 and 15% in men and 46% and 39% in women, respectively. Adjustment for smoking and respiratory symptoms altered the estimates differently in men and women. For FEV1 and DLco, the variance explained by smoking and symptoms was larger in men. Further, smoking and symptoms explained genetic variance in women, but was primarily associated with shared environmental effects in men.\nDifferences between men and women were found in how smoking and symptoms influence the variation in lung function. Pulmonary gas transfer variation related to the menstrual cycle has been shown before, and the findings regarding DLco in the present study indicates gender specific environmental susceptibility not shown before. As a consequence the results suggest that patients with lung diseases such as COPD could benefit from interventions that are sex specific.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, the overall rate of preterm births has increased. The aim of the present study was to examine whether this trend is also seen for multiple gestations. More specifically, we examined if there has been a decrease in gestational age for live born monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins and if there has been a simultaneous change in birthweight. The contributions of fertility treatments and Caesarean sections were taken into consideration. All analyses were carried out in two large European twin cohorts.\nCross-sectional study of 6310 live born twin pairs, born between 1964-2007, from the Belgian East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey and 14,712 twin pairs, born between 1990-2006, from the Netherlands Twin Register. Multiple regression analyses were performed with gestational age as outcome variable, and multilevel analysis with birthweight as outcome variable. All analyses were performed with and without adjustment for zygosity, parity, maternal age, mode of conception and delivery and, for the analyses of birthweight, gestational age.\nGestational age decreased in a linear fashion from 1964 to 2007 with a decrease of 0.25 days per year in a similar way for MZ and DZ twins. Changes in birthweight depended on gestational age: up to 32 weeks, birthweight decreased and after 32 weeks birthweight increased. The frequency of infertility treatment and Caesarean sections, primiparity and advanced maternal age increased over the years, but none of these factors influenced the secular trends in gestational age and birthweight.\nThe decrease in gestational age and change in birthweight in twins are sources of concern, especially for very preterm twins, for whom birthweight decreased. For twins born after 32 weeks, an increase in birthweight was observed and this is very likely the explanation for the decrease in gestational age.",

    "abstract": "Lateralization for language, spatial judgment and face processing was assessed in 42 pairs of identical twins, 21 discordant and 21 concordant pairs for handedness, using fMRI. Individual laterality indices were calculated based on the observed activation patterns. All tasks showed expected asymmetry, favoring the left-hemisphere for language and the right-hemisphere for spatial judgment and face processing. The intra-class correlations on the laterality indices were significant only on the language task and only for the concordant group, but not the discordant group, suggesting a stronger genetic influence for language asymmetry in concordant twins. The expected asymmetry was greater for the concordant group only on the language task. The difference was not significant, but conformed quite well to Annett's genetic model, which assumes a right-shift (RS) gene with one allele (RS+) biasing toward right-handedness and left-cerebral language dominance, and the other (RS-) leaving both asymmetries to chance. The model also assumes that the genetic influence is additive for handedness but dominant-recessive for left-cerebral language dominance, which explains the high concordance for language dominance in twins discordant for handedness. Our data suggest that the same gene has no influence on right-hemisphere dominance for spatial judgment or face processing, and offer little support for mirror-imaging in MZ twins other than that due to chance.",

These include cross-circulation between the twins that results in induction of both the twins after the administration of i.v. induction agent to one twin and difficulty in mask ventilating both the twins simultaneously due to the angle between the heads; different arterial pressures in the two children complicate pharmacological management and underline the importance of physiological measures to control arterial pressure. Adequate preparation and teamwork is the keystone to the management of these patients.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the longitudinal causal relationship between self-perceived abilities (SPA) and academic achievement (Ach) while controlling for cognitive ability (CA). In all, 5957 UK school children were assessed on SPA, Ach and CA at ages 9 and 12. Results indicated that SPA and Ach at age 9 independently affected both SPA and Ach at age 12, even when CA was considered. Moreover the effects of previous Ach on subsequent SPA were of similar magnitude to the effects of prior SPA on subsequent Ach, suggesting that the link between SPA and Ach independent of CA is reflective of both \"insight\" (children's accounts of their previous performance) and self-efficacy (the self-fulfilling or motivational effects of self-beliefs). Practical and theoretical implications for the study of SPA are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The Vesicle Inducing Protein in Plastids 1 (Vipp1) was suggested to be involved in thylakoid membrane formation in both chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. The protein shows sequence homology to the Phage Shock Protein A (PspA) from bacteria, and both proteins have similar secondary structures. 2D-structures of PspA and of Vipp1 have been determined by electron microscopy in the recent years. Both PspA and Vipp1 form large homooligomeric rings with high molecular masses but their ring dimensions differ significantly. Furthermore, Vipp1 forms rings with different rotational symmetries whereas PspA appears to form rings with singular rotational symmetry. In this article addendum we compare the structures of PspA and Vipp1. Furthermore, we suggest a spatial structural model of the observed Vipp1 rings.",

    "abstract": "We sought to investigate outcomes of contemporaneously managed monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins, stratified by pregnancy complication.\nFour hundred eighteen MCDA pregnancies from 2001 through 2008 were retrospectively reviewed.\nThere were 236 ongoing pregnancies at 24 weeks' gestation. The likelihood of progressing from 24 weeks to 2 live births was 98.7% in uncomplicated pregnancies, 89.7% with twin-twin transfusion syndrome, and 100% with growth discordance, increasing at 32 weeks to 99.5%, 93.8%, and 100%, respectively. The relative risk (RR) of birth <32 weeks was significantly greater in twin-twin transfusion syndrome (RR, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.7-6.1) and growth discordant (RR, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-3.8) pregnancies than in uncomplicated pregnancies (P < .0001).\nThis represents one of the largest cohorts of MCDA twins. The risk of third-trimester fetal loss was low. The likelihood of both intrauterine fetal demise and preterm birth were greater in complicated pregnancies. In the absence of a clinical indication for delivery, these data do not support elective preterm delivery for prevention of intrauterine fetal demise in uncomplicated MCDA twins.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence for a cerebellar role in human cognition has accrued with respect to anatomically and functionally distinct lobules. Questions of laterality, however, have been largely overlooked. This study therefore introduced and applied a novel measurement protocol for comparatively bias-free analysis of cerebellar asymmetries. Volumetric measurements were performed on magnetic resonance images from a single pair of monozygotic handedness-discordant twins. Against a background of functional cortical asymmetry for verbal and visuo-spatial functional magnetic resonance imaging activation, which was mirrored in the left-handed twin (Lux et al. 2008), between-twin differences in cerebellar asymmetry are described. Interestingly, asymmetry measures for the whole cerebellum did not correspond to either the direction of hand preference or to the weaker (functional magnetic resonance imaging) lateralization of the left-handed twin. The twins both showed clockwise cerebellar torques. This mirrored a counter-clockwise cerebral torque in the right-handed twin only. Selected single cerebellar lobules V and VII displayed between-twin laterality differences that partially reflected their discrepant handedness. Whole cerebellum anatomical measures appeared to be unrelated to single functional cortical asymmetries. These analyses contribute further anatomical evidence pertaining to the existence of multiple structurally and functionally distinct cortico-cerebellar networks of the healthy human brain in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Studies of singletons suggest that right-handed individuals may have higher levels of testosterone than do left-handed individuals. Prenatal testosterone levels are hypothesised to be especially related to handedness formation. In humans, female members from opposite-sex twin pairs may experience elevated level of prenatal exposure to testosterone in their intrauterine environment shared with a male. We tested for differences in rates of left-handedness/right-handedness in female twins from same-sex and opposite-sex twin pairs. Our sample consisted of 4736 subjects, about 70% of all Finnish twins born in 1983-1987, with information on measured pregnancy and birth related factors. Circulating testosterone and estradiol levels at age 14 were available on 771 and 744 of these twins, respectively. We found significantly (p=.006) lower prevalence of left-handedness in females from opposite-sex pairs (5.3%) compared to females from same-sex pairs (8.6%). The circulating levels of neither testosterone nor estradiol related to handedness in either females or males. Nor were there differences in circulating testosterone or estradiol levels between females from opposite-sex and same-sex twin pairs. Birth and pregnancy related factors for which we had information were unrelated to handedness. Our results are difficult to fully explain by postnatal factors, but they offer support to theory that relates testosterone to formation of handedness, and in a population-based sample, are suggestive of effects of prenatal testosterone transfer.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of fetal programming following in utero demise of a co-twin are poorly understood.\nThe authors examined fetal programming using a unique application of the change-point analysis method, and identified two types of fetal programming that occurred when a viable twin sibling died in utero, while the co-twin survived.\nIn one type, the initial twin fetal programming trajectory was maintained while in a subset of surviving co-twins a \"switch\" from a twin to a singleton fetal program (dual fetal programming exposure) was observed. The results suggest that the timing in utero of conversion from a twin to a singleton programming pattern occurred slightly earlier among opposite-sex than in same-sex surviving co-twins.\nFor the conversion from a twin to a singleton program to happen, the surviving co-twin must have attained a \"critical mass\" when the twin sibling died. Whereas, for same-sex surviving co-twins the critical mass for conversion was the 80th percentile of gestational-age specific birth weight, opposite-sex surviving co-twins converted at a lower critical mass (70th percentile). These novel findings warrant further study to confirm the new hithertofore unknown phenomenon of dual fetal programming sequence, and to determine the implications in terms of subsequent morbidity or mortality during infancy, childhood and adult life.",

    "abstract": "To study the level and heritability of serum total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) in adult twins sampled from Qingdao City of China.\n316 pairs of healthy twin aged 18 to 60 years were recruited from the database of Qingdao City twin registry. Fasting serum lipids were detected by automatic biochemical analyzer. The zygosity of twins was established by using polymorphic DNA-based microsatellite markers. The heritability was estimated by formulating univariate ACE twin mode in Mx soft.\nThe average levels of fasting serum TC, HDL-C, LDL-C and TG were (4.52 +/- 1.08), (1.46 +/- 0.39), (2.58 +/- 0.79) and (1.11 +/- 0.77) mmol/L, respectively. The best fitting models adjusted by sex and age in Mx soft were AE model for TC, HDL-C and LDL-C, whereas CE model for TG. The heritability of TC, HDL-C, LDL-C and TG were 53% , 62% , 57% and 0, respectively.\nIt is considered that both genetic and environmental factors may influence the level of TC, HDL-C and LDL-C, whereas environmental effect may be the factor essential for the level of TG.",

The neonatal outcomes of MD twins conceived by assisted reproductive technology or ovulation induction were compared to the outcomes of those conceived naturally.\nIn MD twins with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (FLP) resulted in the survival of at least one twin. In naturally conceived MD twins with two live births, we found that there was a higher discordance rate and the incidence of intrauterine growth retardation was higher in twins born to nulliparous women than multiparous women.\nFurther FLP treatment can be performed on twins with TTTS so that prognosis may be improved. Since the risk of discordant growth is significantly greater in twins of nulliparous women, they should be monitored more carefully than multiparous women.",

Daily supplementation was associated with increased bone density and bone strength at the distal tibia and radius.\npQCT has not been used to assess bone responses to calcium and vitamin-D supplementation on peripubertal children. This randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the impact of a 6-month daily calcium and vitamin-D supplementation on trabecular and cortical bone acquisition at distal tibial and radial sites using pQCT.\nTwenty pairs of peripubertal female identical twins, aged 9 to 13 years, were randomly assigned to receive either 800 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D3, or a matched placebo.

Greater gains in cortical area at the 38% and 66% of tibial sites were also found in twins receiving the calcium supplement (p=0.001).\nDaily supplementation for a period of 6 months was associated with increased trabecular area, trabecular density and strength strain index at the ultra-distal tibia and radius and increased cortical area at tibial mid-shaft.",

    "abstract": "Frontostriatal networks mediating important cognitive and motor functions have been shown to be abnormal structurally and functionally in schizophrenia. However, the influence of genetic risk for schizophrenia on structural abnormalities in these areas is not well established. This study therefore aimed to investigate prefrontal and striatal volume alterations in schizophrenia and to define the extent to which they are dependent on genetic vulnerability for the condition. We employed structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) in monozygotic (MZ) twins with or without schizophrenia. A sample of 129 twins completed sMRI, consisting of 21 MZ twin pairs concordant for schizophrenia, 17 MZ schizophrenic twins and 18 MZ nonschizophrenic twins drawn from 19 pairs discordant for schizophrenia, and 26 MZ control twin pairs without schizophrenia. Groups did not significantly differ in age, gender, handedness, height, level of education, parental socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. Using a region-of-interest approach, we measured the gray matter volumes (in cm(3)) of superior, middle, inferior, and orbital frontal cortices (SFC, MFC, IFC, and OFC, respectively); the caudate; and putamen. Covarying for whole-brain volume, age, and gender, we found that concordant but not discordant twins with schizophrenia had significantly lower volumes of MFC and OFC than control twins. In contrast, both patient groups had significantly lower SFC volumes than both groups of nonschizophrenic twins. There were no significant group differences in IFC and the striatum. We conclude that the prefrontal cortex shows a heterogeneous pattern of genetic influences on volumetric reductions in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Plasma levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) are associated with risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance (IR), and hypertension. Limited data exist on whether there is genetic covariance between plasma levels of GGT and NAFLD risk factors. Variants of beta2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2) have been associated with dyslipidemia, IR, and hypertension, but its effect on GGT secretion is not known. We estimated the heritability of GGT using a twin-study design and examined the genetic covariance between GGT levels, IR, hypertension, levels of low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides, and ADRB2 variants.\nWe studied phenotypes of 362 twins; the heritabilities of increased GGT activity and genetic covariance with NAFLD risk factors were estimated by variance-component methodology. ADRB2 genotype associations with plasma GGT activity were examined using generalized estimating equations to account for intra-twinship correlations.\nGGT activity was heritable at 49% +/- 8% of the twin cohort and had significant covariance with IR; insulin, triglyceride, and uric acid levels; and diastolic blood pressure. In generalized estimating equation models, the most common haplotype of ADRB2 was significantly associated with plasma GGT activity. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms in ADRB2 were associated with levels of GGT; ADRB2 haplotypes displayed pleiotropic effects on GGT and triglyceride levels.\nIn a twin study, GGT shared genetic codetermination with traits of metabolic syndrome. The ADRB2 gene had pleiotropic effects on plasma levels of GGT and triglycerides, indicating linked pathways (eg, adrenergic) between genetic susceptibility to NAFLD and metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "We show a novel approach for\u2002k-FWER control which does not involve any correction, but only testing the hypotheses along a (possibly data-driven) order until a suitable number of\u2002p-values are found above the uncorrected \u03b1 level.\u2002p-values can arise from any linear model in a parametric or nonparametric setting. The approach is not only very simple and computationally undemanding, but also the data-driven order enhances power when the sample size is small (and also when\u2002k\u2002and/or the number of tests is large). We illustrate the method on an original study about gene discovery in multiple sclerosis, in which were involved a small number of couples of twins, discordant by disease.

    "abstract": "Velamentous cord insertion and vasa previa occur more frequently in monochorionic twin pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies. Both have been linked with poor perinatal outcome due to the increased risk of rupture of the velamentous vessels. We present a case of acute fetal distress in 2 fetuses in a monochorionic twin pregnancy caused by ruptured vasa previa that was not detected antenatally. Both infants were severely anemic at birth. Acute blood loss in twin 1 through the ruptured vessels, led to an acute feto-fetal transfusion from the co-twin through the placental vascular anastomoses. In monochorionic twins, ruptured vasa previa and acute hemorrhage in one fetus can lead to acute feto-fetal transfusion and result in severe hypovolemic shock and acute anemia in both fetuses. Increased awareness for vasa previa and the characteristic placental angioarchitecture in monochorionic twinning is of paramount importance.",
