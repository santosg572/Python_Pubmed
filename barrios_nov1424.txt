    "abstract": "Meditation is a family of ancient and contemporary contemplative mind-body practices that can modulate psychological processes, awareness, and mental states. Over the last 40 years, clinical science has manualised meditation practices and designed various meditation interventions (MIs), that have shown therapeutic efficacy for disorders including depression, pain, addiction, and anxiety. Over the past decade, neuroimaging has examined the neuroscientific basis of meditation practices, effects, states, and outcomes for clinical and non-clinical populations. However, the generalizability and replicability of current neuroscientific models of meditation are yet to be established, as they are largely based on small datasets entrenched with heterogeneity along several domains of meditation (e.g., practice types, meditation experience, clinical disorder targeted), experimental design, and neuroimaging methods (e.g., preprocessing, analysis, task-based, resting-state, structural MRI). These limitations have precluded a nuanced and rigorous neuroscientific phenotyping of meditation practices and their potential benefits. Here, we present ENIGMA-Meditation, the first worldwide collaborative consortium for neuroscientific investigations of meditation practices. ENIGMA-Meditation will enable systematic meta- and mega-analyses of globally distributed neuroimaging datasets of meditation using shared, standardized neuroimaging methods and tools to improve statistical power and generalizability. Through this powerful collaborative framework, existing neuroscientific accounts of meditation practices can be extended to generate novel and rigorous neuroscientific insights, accounting for multi-domain heterogeneity. ENIGMA-Meditation will inform neuroscientific mechanisms underlying therapeutic action of meditation practices on psychological and cognitive attributes, advancing the field of meditation and contemplative neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "The claustrum is an irregular and fine sheet of grey matter in the basolateral telencephalon present in almost all mammals. The claustrum has been the object of several studies using animal models and, more recently, in human beings using neuroimaging. One of the most extended cognitive processes attributed to the claustrum is the salience process, which is also related to the insular cortex. In the same way, studies with human subjects and functional magnetic resonance imaging have reported the coactivation of the claustrum/insular cortex in the integration of sensory signals. This coactivation has been reported in the left claustrum/insular cortex or in the right claustrum/insular cortex. The asymmetry has been reported in task studies and literature related to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, relating the severity of delusions with the reduction in left claustral volume. We present a functional connectivity study of the claustrum. Resting-state functional and anatomical MRI data from 100 healthy subjects were analyzed; taken from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, NIH Blueprint: The Human Connectome Project), with 2x2x2 mm3 voxel resolution. We hypothesize that 1) the claustrum is a node involved in different brain networks, 2) the functional connectivity pattern of the claustrum is different from the insular cortex's pattern, and 3) the asymmetry is present in the claustrum's functional connectivity. Our findings include at least three brain networks related to the claustrum. We found functional connectivity between the claustrum, frontoparietal network, and the default mode network as a distinctive attribute. The functional connectivity between the right claustrum with the frontoparietal network and the dorsal attention network supports the hypothesis of claustral asymmetry. These findings provide functional evidence, suggesting that the claustrum is coupled with the frontoparietal network serving together to instantiate new task states by flexibly modulating and interacting with other control and processing networks.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported that cannabis consumption affects the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a structure with a central role in mediating the empathic response. In this study, we compared psychometric scores of empathy subscales, between a group of regular cannabis users (85, users) and a group of non-consumers (51, controls). We found that users have a greater Emotional Comprehension, a cognitive empathy trait involving the understanding of the \"other\" emotional state. Resting state functional MRI in a smaller sample (users\u2009=\u200946, controls\u2009=\u200934) allowed to identify greater functional connectivity (FC) of the ACC with the left somatomotor cortex (SMC), in users when compared to controls. These differences were also evident within the empathy core network, where users showed greater within network FC. The greater FC showed by the users is associated with emotional representational areas and empathy-related regions. In addition, the differences in psychometric scores suggest that users have more empathic comprehension. These findings suggest a potential association between cannabis use, a greater comprehension of the other's affective state and the functional brain organization of the users. However, further research is needed to explore such association, since many other factors may be at play.",

    "abstract": "In a segregated society, marked by a historical background of inequalities, there is a consistent under-representation of ethnic and racial minorities in biomedical research, causing disparities in understanding genetic and acquired diseases as well as in the effectiveness of clinical treatments affecting different groups. The repeated inclusion of small and non-representative samples of the population in neuroimaging research has led to generalization bias in the morphological characterization of the human brain. A few brain morphometric studies between Whites and African Americans have reported differences in orbitofrontal volumetry and insula cortical thickness. Nevertheless, these studies are mostly conducted in small samples and populations with cognitive impairment. For this reason, this study aimed to identify brain morphological variability due to racial identity in representative samples. We hypothesized that, in neurotypical young adults, there are differences in brain morphometry between participants with distinct racial identities. We analyzed the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database to test this hypothesis. Brain volumetry, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area measures of participants identified as ",

    "abstract": "Adolescence is a crucial developmental period in terms of behavior and mental health. Therefore, understanding how the brain develops during this stage is a fundamental challenge for neuroscience. Recent studies have modeled the brain as a network or connectome, mainly applying measures from graph theory, showing a change in its functional organization, such as an increase in its segregation and integration. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) complements such modeling by extracting high-dimensional features across the whole range of connectivity values instead of exploring a fixed set of connections. This study inquires into the developmental trajectories of such properties using a longitudinal sample of typically developing human participants (",

    "abstract": "Different theoretical models have proposed cognitive and affective components in empathy and moral judgments encompassing compassion. Furthermore, gender differences in psychological and neural functions involving empathic and moral processing, as well as compassionate experiences, have been reported. However, the neurobiological function regarding affective and cognitive integration underlying compassion and gender-associated differences has not been investigated. In this study, we aimed to examine the interaction between cognitive and emotional components through functional connectivity analyzes and to explore gender differences for the recruitment and interaction of these components. Thirty-six healthy participants (21-56 years; 21 women) were exposed to social images in an fMRI session to judge whether the stimuli elicited compassion. The results showed a different connectivity pattern for women and men of the insular cortex, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the cingulate cortex. The integration of affective and cognitive components follows a complex functional connectivity pattern that is different for both genders. These differences may indicate that men largely make compassionate judgments based on contextual information, while women tend to notably take internal and introspective processes into account. Women and men can use different affective and cognitive routes that could converge in similar learning of moral values, empathic experiences and compassionate acts.",

Since psychotherapists constitute a population that tends to display greater empathic abilities, as shown in psychometric differences in cognitive empathy and emotional regulation, we aimed to identify cortical thickness (CT) differences between a group of professional psychotherapists and a control group. In line with the recently emphasized urge to employ more than a single workflow in cortical analyses, we utilized two cortical surface extraction and thickness estimation pipelines-CIVET and FreeSurfer. Eighteen psychotherapists and eighteen controls underwent MRI scanning and completed empathy-related psychometric assessments. We evaluated how CT measures differed between groups and if there was an association with individual empathy-related scores in a series of regions of interest (ROIs). Our analysis with CIVET shows that psychotherapists display a significantly greater CT at a ROI in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; p\u2009<\u20090.05, FDR corrected). With FreeSurfer, a whole-brain vertex-wise analysis identified a statistically significant cluster in the left PFC that partially overlaps with the previous ROI. These results were reinforced by a structural covariance analysis revealing that, in psychotherapists, the left dlPFC ROI seemed to vary independently from the rest of the cortex. These findings are relevant because the dlPFC region importantly participates in the cognitive components of the empathic response, such as emotion regulation and perspective taking. Thus, our findings support the idea that empathic capacity is reflected by brain structural variations while also studying for the first time a sample of subjects for whom empathic responding is crucial in their profession.",

    "abstract": "Modulation of reflex responses is crucial to adapt our behavior and cognition, and this is especially difficult when biological relevant stimuli are present such as emotional faces. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of peripherally presented happy and angry facial expressions in reflexive saccades and saccadic inhibition/re-orientation of attention. Behavior through eye-tracking technique and fMRI event-related BOLD signals activations were evaluated in adult males during the performance of an antisaccade task. fMRI signals obtained during task performance were compared to a baseline. Results showed that antisaccades had a lower percentage of correct responses and higher latency onsets than prosaccades. At the activation brain level, differences between both emotions and the baseline were found during stimuli presentation. Prosaccades for happy and angry faces recruited larger clusters with higher Z values mainly in occipito-parietal and temporal regions related to visual basic and integration processing, as well as regions of the oculomotor network. Meanwhile, when compared to the baseline, antisaccades recruited similar areas but a lower number of clusters with lower Z values as expected for peripheral processing of faces. At antisaccades, happy faces recruited parieto-occipital, temporal and cerebellar regions, while the angry faces added activation of orbital and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex related to emotional regulation. These results suggest that emotional facial expressions are being processed outside of the focus of attention. Particularly, angry expressions recruit a wider brain network in order to inhibit automatic behavior and re-orientate voluntary attention efficiently that may be due to its biological relevance.",

    "abstract": "During a social evaluation, the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) plays an important role according to its contribution in making inferences about the mental states of others. However, what is the neural response if rTPJ function is inhibited during a mentalizing task? In this study, participants played the Dictator Game with two confederates: one playing cooperation (C) and other playing non-cooperation (NC) role and then they were scanned during a mentalizing test. However, we inhibited rTPJ using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) after they played the game and before they were scanned. In this test, participants read negative (Neg) or positive (Pos) personal situations and then they watched confederate's pictures. Images from the TMS group were compared against controls with no TMS stimulation. After statistical comparison, we found a significantly higher activity in right and left visual association areas (BA 18) during the NCPos > NCNeg condition in the TMS group compared with the No-TMS group. Same visual association areas have been described before when participants are processing visual emotional information or when making a fast social categorization. This could reflect a neural mechanism of socio - emotional categorization that emerges after rTPJ inhibition.",

    "abstract": "In a therapeutic environment a proper regulation of the empathic response strengthens the patient-therapist relationship. Thus, it is important that psychotherapists constantly regulate their own perspective and emotions to better understand the other's affective state. We compared the empathic abilities of a group of 52 psychotherapists with a group of 92 non-psychotherapists and found psychometric differences. Psychotherapists showed greater scores in Fantasy and Perspective Taking, both cognitive empathy constructs, and lower scores in the use of expressive suppression, an emotional regulation strategy that hampers the empathic response, suggesting that psychotherapists exert top-down processes that influence their empathic response. In addition, the expected sex differences in empathic concern and expressive suppression were only present in the non-psychotherapist group. To see if such psychometric differences were related to a distinctive functional organization of brain networks, we contrasted the resting state functional connectivity of empathy-related brain regions between a group of 18 experienced psychotherapists and a group of 18 non-psychotherapists. Psychotherapists showed greater functional connectivity between the left anterior insula and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and less connectivity between rostral anterior cingulate cortex and the orbito prefrontal cortex. Both associations correlated with Perspective Taking scores. Considering that the psychometric differences between groups were in the cognitive domain and that the functional connectivity associations involve areas related to cognitive regulation processes, these results suggest a relationship between the functional brain organization of psychotherapists and the cognitive regulation of their empathic response.",

    "abstract": "This paper shows the brain correlates of Cloninger's personality model during the presentation of social scenarios under positive or negative valence situations. Social scenarios were constructed when participants played the Dictator game with two confederates that had two opposites roles as the cooperator (Coop) and non-cooperator (NoCoop). Later the same day during a fMRI scanning session, participants read negative (Neg) and positive (Pos) situations that happened to confederates in the past. Participants were asked to think \"how do you think those people felt during that situation?\" A dissimilarity matrix between stimuli were obtained from fMRI results. Results shown that Harm Avoidance trait people make use of right middle frontal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus to discriminate between Coop and NoCoop. Cooperation as a trait makes use of the right superior temporal gyrus and the right precuneus to discriminate between Coop and NoCoop in positive social scenarios. Finally, Self-directedness trait people make use of the right inferior parietal lobe to discriminate between Coop and NoCoop in negative social scenarios and the right precuneus to discriminate between Coop and Strangers. An intuitive link between discrimination findings and behavioral patterns of those personality traits is proposed.",

    "abstract": "The cortical thickness has been used as a biomarker to assess different cerebral conditions and to detect alterations in the cortical mantle. In this work, we compare methods from the FreeSurfer software, the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12), a Laplacian approach and a new method here proposed, based on the Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT), and its corresponding computational phantom designed to validate the calculation algorithm. At region of interest (ROI) level, within- and inter-method comparisons were carried out with a test-retest analysis, in a subset comprising 21 healthy subjects taken from the Multi-Modal MRI Reproducibility Resource (MMRR) dataset. From the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease (MIRIAD) data, classification methods were compared in their performance to detect cortical thickness differences between 23 healthy controls (HC) and 45 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The validation of the proposed EDT-based method showed a more accurate and precise distance measurement as voxel resolution increased. For the within-method comparisons, mean test-retest measures (percentages differences/intraclass correlation/Pearson correlation) were similar for FreeSurfer (1.80%/0.90/0.95), CAT12 (1.91%/0.83/0.91), Laplacian (1.27%/0.89/0.95) and EDT (2.20%/0.88/0.94). Inter-method correlations showed moderate to strong values (R\u2009>\u20090.77) and, in the AD comparison study, all methods were able to detect cortical alterations between groups. Surface- and voxel-based methods have advantages and drawbacks regarding computational demands and measurement precision, while thickness definition was mainly associated to the cortical thickness absolute differences among methods. However, for each method, measurements were reliable, followed similar trends along the cortex and allowed detection of cortical atrophies between HC and patients with AD.",

    "abstract": "Focused attention to spontaneous sensations is a dynamic process that demands interoceptive abilities. Failure to control it has been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders like illness-anxiety disorder. Regulatory strategies, such as focused attention meditation (FAM), may enhance the ability to control focused attention particularly to body sensations, which can be reflected on functional neuroanatomy. The functional connectivity (FC) related to focused attention has been described, however, the dynamic brain organization associated to this process and the differences to the resting state remains to be studied. To quantify the cerebral dynamic counterpart of focused attention to interoception, we examined fifteen experienced meditators while performing a 20-min attentional task to spontaneous sensations. Subjects underwent three scanning sessions obtaining a resting-state scan before and after the task. Sliding window dynamic FC (DFC) and k-means clustering identified five recurrent FC patterns along the dorsal attention network (DAN), default mode network (DMN), and frontoparietal network (FPN). Subjects remained longer in a low connectivity brain pattern during the resting conditions. By contrast, subjects spent a higher proportion of time in complex patterns during the task than rest. Moreover, a carry-over effect in FC was observed following the interoceptive task performance, suggestive of an active role in the learning process linked to cognitive training. Our results suggest that focused attention to interoceptive processes, demands a dynamic brain organization with specific features that distinguishes it from the resting condition. This approach may provide new insights characterizing the neural basis of the focused attention, an essential component for human adaptability.",

    "abstract": "Adolescence is a developmental period that dramatically impacts body and behavior, with pubertal hormones playing an important role not only in the morphological changes in the body but also in brain structure and function. Understanding brain development during adolescence has become a priority in neuroscience because it coincides with the onset of many psychiatric and behavioral disorders. However, little is known about how puberty influences the brain functional connectome. In this study, taking a longitudinal human sample of typically developing children and adolescents (of both sexes), we demonstrate that the development of the brain functional connectome better fits pubertal status than chronological age. In particular, centrality, segregation, efficiency, and integration of the brain functional connectome increase after the onset of the pubertal markers. We found that these effects are stronger in attention and task control networks. Lastly, after controlling for this effect, we showed that functional connectivity between these networks is related to better performance in cognitive flexibility. This study points out the importance of considering longitudinal nonlinear trends when exploring developmental trajectories, and emphasizes the impact of puberty on the functional organization of the brain in adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Semantic verbal fluency is among the most employed tasks in cognitive aging research and substantial work is devoted to understanding the underlying mechanisms behind age-related differences at the neural and behavioral levels. The present investigation aimed to evaluate the role of moderating variables, such as age, sex, MMSE, and proxies of cognitive reserve (CR) on the hemodynamic response evoked by semantic verbal fluency in healthy young and healthy older adults. So far, no study has been conducted to this end. To elucidate the exclusive effect of the mentioned variables on brain activation during semantic fluency, finger tapping was included as a control task. Results showed that disregarding adjustments for age, older adults displayed important parietal activations during semantic fluency as well as during finger-tapping. Specifically, the anterior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS) and left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) were areas activated in both tasks in the older group. Younger adults, only displayed parietal activations related to age and sex when these demographics were employed as predictors. Concerning proxies of CR in semantic fluency, the only vocabulary was an important moderator in both age groups. Higher vocabulary scores were associated with lesser activation in occipital areas. Education did not show significant correlations with brain activity during semantic fluency in any of the groups. However, both CR proxies were significantly correlated to brain activations of older adults during finger tapping. Specifically, vocabulary was associated with frontal regions, while education correlated with parietal lobe and cingulate gyrus. Finally, the effects of MMSE were mostly observed on brain activation of older adults in both tasks. These findings demonstrate that the effects of moderating variables on shaping brain activation are intricate and not exclusive of complex verbal tasks. Thus, before adjusting for \"nuisance variables,\" their importance needs to be established. This is especially true for samples including older adults for whom a motor task may be a demanding operation due to normal age-related processes of dedifferentiation.",

    "abstract": "A voxel-based method for measuring sulcal width was developed, validated and applied to a database. This method (EDT-based LM) employs the 3D Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) of the pial surface and a Local Maxima labeling algorithm. A computational phantom was designed to test method performance; results revealed the method's inaccuracy \u03b4, to range between 0.1 and 0.5 voxels, for a width that varied between 1 and 7 voxels. Two morphological descriptors were computed to characterize each defined sulcus: mean sulcal width (MSW) and mean absolute deviation (MAD). The former is the average width for all available width measurements within the sulcus, and the latter is the deviation of these measurements. The EDT-based LM method was applied to the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in the Alzheimer's Disease (MIRIAD) database, for a set of high-resolution Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of 66 subjects: 43 patients with Alzheimer Disease (AD) and 23 control subjects. AD causes significant gray matter loss; hence, some sulci were expected to broaden. Methodological results concurred with this hypothesis. After a Wilcoxon test, MSW was grater in the case of all sulci pertaining to AD patients, (p\u202f<\u202f0.05, FDR corrected), whereas MAD showed significant differences in 8 sulci (p\u202f<\u202f0.05, FDR corrected). This work presents a novel voxel-based method for measuring sulcal width and extracting descriptors to characterize and compare the sulci within and across subjects.",

    "abstract": "Conductive hearing loss (CHL) is a prevalent hearing impairment in humans. The goal of the protocol is to describe a simple surgical procedure for inducing CHL in rodents. The protocol demonstrates CHL by tympanic membrane puncture. Verification of CHL surgery was by otoscope examination and behavioral assessment by clap startle response, both replicable and reliable, and are simple methods to demonstrate hearing loss has occurred. The simple CHL procedure is advantageous due to its reproducibility and flexibility to different pursuits in hearing loss research. The limitations of inducing CHL by a surgical approach are associated with the learning curve to perform the surgical procedure and confidence in audiological examination. Inducing a hearing impairment by CHL allows one to readily study the neural manifestations and behavioral outcomes of hearing loss.",

    "abstract": "While brain default mode network (DMN) activation in human subjects has been associated with mind wandering, meditation practice has been found to suppress it and to increase psychological well-being. In addition to DMN activity reduction, experienced meditators (EMs) during meditation practice show an increased connectivity between the DMN and the central executive network (CEN). However, the gradual change between DMN and CEN configuration from pre-meditation, during meditation, and post-meditation is unknown. Here, we investigated the change in DMN and CEN configuration by means of brain activity and functional connectivity (FC) analyses in EMs across three back-to-back functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans: pre-meditation baseline (trait), meditation (state), and post-meditation (state-to-trait). Pre-meditation baseline group comparison was also performed between EMs and healthy controls (HCs). Meditation trait was characterized by a significant reduction in activity and FC within DMN and increased anticorrelations between DMN and CEN. Conversely, meditation state and meditation state-to-trait periods showed increased activity and FC within the DMN and between DMN and CEN. However, the latter anticorrelations were only present in EMs with limited practice. The interactions between networks during these states by means of positive diametric activity (PDA) of the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFFs) defined as [Formula: see text] revealed no trait differences but significant increases during meditation state that persisted in meditation state-to-trait. The gradual reconfiguration in DMN and CEN suggest a neural mechanism by which the CEN negatively regulates the DMN and is probably responsible for the long-term trait changes seen in meditators and reported psychological well-being.",

    "abstract": "Listening to self-chosen, pleasant and relaxing music reduces pain in fibromyalgia (FM), a chronic centralized pain condition. However, the neural correlates of this effect are fairly unknown. In our study, we wished to investigate the neural correlates of music-induced analgesia (MIA) in FM patients. To do this, we studied 20 FM patients and 20 matched healthy controls (HC) acquiring rs-fMRI with a 3T MRI scanner, and pain data before and after two 5-min auditory conditions: music and noise. We performed resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) seed-based correlation analyses (SCA) using pain and analgesia-related ROIs to determine the effects before and after the music intervention in FM and HC, and its correlation with pain reports. We found significant differences in baseline rs-FC between FM and HC. Both groups showed changes in rs-FC after the music condition. FM patients reported MIA that was significantly correlated with rs-FC decrease between the angular gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, and rs-FC increase between amygdala and middle frontal gyrus. These areas are related to autobiographical and limbic processes, and auditory attention, suggesting MIA may arise as a consequence of top-down modulation, probably originated by distraction, relaxation, positive emotion, or a combination of these mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Humans perceive musical sound as a complex phenomenon, which is known to induce an emotional response. The cues used to perceive emotion in music have not been unequivocally elucidated. Here, we sought to identify the attributes of sound that confer an emotion to music and determine if professional musicians have different musical emotion perception than non-musicians. The objective was to determine which sound cues are used to resolve emotional signals. Happy or sad classical music excerpts modified in fine structure or envelope conveying different degrees of emotional certainty were presented. Certainty was determined by identification of the emotional characteristic presented during a forced-choice discrimination task. Participants were categorized as good or poor performers (",

    "abstract": "How do humans discriminate emotion from non-emotion? The specific psychophysical cues and neural responses involved with resolving emotional information in sound are unknown. In this study we used a discrimination psychophysical-fMRI sparse sampling paradigm to locate threshold responses to happy and sad acoustic stimuli. The fine structure and envelope of auditory signals were covaried to vary emotional certainty. We report that emotion identification at threshold in music utilizes fine structure cues. The auditory cortex was activated but did not vary with emotional uncertainty. Amygdala activation was modulated by emotion identification and was absent when emotional stimuli were chance identifiable, especially in the left hemisphere. The right hemisphere amygdala was considerably more deactivated in response to uncertain emotion. The threshold of emotion was signified by a right amygdala deactivation and change of left amygdala greater than right amygdala activation. Functional sex differences were noted during binaural uncertain emotional stimuli presentations, where the right amygdala showed larger activation in females. Negative control (silent stimuli) experiments investigated sparse sampling of silence to ensure modulation effects were inherent to emotional resolvability. No functional modulation of Heschl's gyrus occurred during silence; however, during rest the amygdala baseline state was asymmetrically lateralized. The evidence indicates changing hemispheric activation and deactivation patterns between the left and right amygdala is a hallmark feature of discriminating emotion from non-emotion in music.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized in the late stages by amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Nevertheless, recent evidence has indicated that early changes in cerebral connectivity could compromise cognitive functions even before the appearance of the classical neuropathological features. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and volumetry were performed in the triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) at 2 months of age, prior to the development of intraneuronal plaque accumulation. We found the 3xTg-AD had significant fractional anisotropy (FA) increase and radial diffusivity (RD) decrease in the cortex compared with wild-type controls, while axial diffusivity (AD) and mean diffusivity (MD) were similar. Interhemispheric hippocampal connectivity was decreased in the 3xTg-AD while connectivity in the caudate putamen (CPu) was similar to controls. Most surprising, ventricular volume in the 3xTg-AD was four times larger than controls. The results obtained in this study characterize the early stage changes in interhemispheric hippocampal connectivity in the 3xTg-AD mouse that could represent a translational biomarker to human models in preclinical stages of the AD.",

    "abstract": "Anthropomorphism implies the attribution of human like emotions and cognition to non-human animals. This tendency may be conditioned by similar morphologies between mammals and is particularly important in primatology. Some neurocognitive findings suggest that prefrontal brain activity associated to conceptual learning influences anthropomorphic judgments, nevertheless, individual differences are also presented indicating that training on primate behavior may influence anthropomorphism. We identified and interpreted brain activity registered by functional magnetic resonance imaging while seven trained primatologists (39.42\u2009\u00b1\u200910.86\u2009yr.) inferred emotions in human primates, non-human primates and non-primate animals; comparisons were made with seven matched scholars with no primatological training (38.71\u2009\u00b1\u20099.34\u2009yr.). Primatologists manifested cerebellar, occipital and frontal activity related to sensory and motor processes when valuating humans and non-human primates, but not for other animals. So, primatological training and experience may elicit brain plasticity processes allowing inner motor and sensory models through frontal and cerebellar interactions.",

With a connectivity approach, we examine the processing of emotions using an exploratory method to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. This research describes our approach to modeling stress paradigms suitable for neuroimaging environments. We showed a short film (4.54 minutes) with high negative emotional valence and high arousal content to 24 healthy male subjects (36.42 years old; SD = 12.14) during fMRI. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to identify networks based on spatial statistical independence. Through this analysis we identified the sensorimotor system and its influence on the dorsal attention and default-mode networks, which in turn have reciprocal activity and modulate networks described as emotional.",

    "abstract": "Hemispheric specialization of cognitive functions is a developmental process that shapes the brain from the gestational stage to adulthood. Functional connectivity of the resting brain has been largely used to infer the hemispheric organization of the spontaneous brain activity. In particular, two main properties have been largely explored throughout development: hemispheric asymmetry of functional connectivity and homotopic functional connectivity. However, their relation with specific cognitive processes typically associated with hemispheric specialization, such as visuospatial abilities, remains largely unexplored. Such relationships could be particularly relevant for the quest of developmental cognitive biomarkers in childhood, a significant maturation period of visuospatial abilities. Moreover, the relation between asymmetry and homotopy of brain functional connectivity is not well understood. We have examined these two properties in a sample of 60 typically developing children between 6 and 10 years of age, and explored their relation with visuospatial abilities. First, we identified a strong negative relation between homotopy and asymmetry across the brain. In addition, these properties showed areas in the posterior portion of the brain, with significant correlation with performance in visual memory and visual attention tasks. These results highlight the relevance of the hemispheric organization of spontaneous brain activity for developmental cognition, particularly for visuospatial abilities.",

    "abstract": "The current study investigated the neural basis of reading performance in 60 school-age Spanish-speaking children, aged 6 to 9years. By using a data-driven approach and an automated matching procedure, we identified a left-lateralized resting state network that included typical language regions (Wernicke's and Broca's regions), prefrontal cortex, pre- and post-central gyri, superior and middle temporal gyri, cerebellum, and subcortical regions, and explored its relevance for reading performance (accuracy, comprehension and speed). Functional connectivity of the left frontal and temporal cortices and subcortical regions predicted reading speed. These results extend previous findings on the relationship between functional connectivity and reading competence in children, providing new evidence about such relationships in previously unexplored regions in the resting brain, including the left caudate, putamen and thalamus. This work highlights the relevance of a broad network, functionally synchronized in the resting state, for the acquisition and perfecting of reading abilities in young children.",

    "abstract": "Mentalizing is a fundamental aspect of social cognition that includes understanding the mental states of others. This process involves the participation of a well-defined set of brain regions. However, it is still unknown how different contextual situations, such as previous cooperative or non-cooperative interactions, can modulate the brain activity related to the inference of others' mental states. Hence, this study investigated whether a previous social interaction can modulate the neural mechanisms involved in a way to response to inferred mental states of cooperators and non-cooperators in positive vs. negative emotional situations. Participants first engaged in a Dictator game with cooperator and non-cooperator confederates. Then, in an fMRI setup, participants had to infer the mental states of the cooperator and non-cooperator confederates under positive and negative situations. Results showed that in addition to the mentalizing network, inferring mental states recruited occipital and cerebellar areas in the cooperative context. A differential pattern of activity that depended on the emotional valence of the situation was also detected, i.e., negative situations recruited prefrontal cortex (PFC) in both contexts, while temporal regions were recruited only for the non-cooperative context. Overall, these results suggest that our previous experiences with others modulate the brain activity related to the inferences we make about their mental states in specific emotional situations.",

Neuropsychological and epidemiological analyses showed significant differences in only two features: more years of education and better performance in the visuospatial process task in the control group. Voxel-based morphometry results were not conclusive, but showed tendencies toward larger volumes in the prefrontal and parietal lobes, and smaller volumes in the right temporal lobe, right occipital lobe, and left cerebellum for the RG; these tendencies are in agreement with those proposed by the posterior-anterior shift in an aging model. Cortical-thickness analyses yielded a significant correlation between cortical thickness and years of education in the prefrontal and inferior-temporal regions, and larger cortical thickness in the RG, independent of age and years of education, in the right superior temporal region. These results suggest changes in the cortical thickness of structures related to memory and visuospatial functions in healthy, cognitively normal individuals before the appearance of cognitive decline. Thus, the performance of healthy elderly individuals with EEG risk may only be slightly different from normal because of compensation mechanisms allowing them to fulfill daily-life tasks, masking structural changes during preclinical neurocognitive disorders.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary approaches have proposed that women possess an advantage over men in emotional functioning to promote attachment for child-rearing. Likewise, sex differences have been reported in traits such as personality and empathy, traits that likely modulate emotional processing. In this preliminary study, sex differences in emotional processing were analyzed, including empathy as a social emotion and personality traits, as well as whether there exist relationships between those measures. Young volunteers (N\u2009=\u2009105) indicated the emotional valence, activation, and dominance that they experience in situations categorized as emotionally positive, negative, or neutral. The results of comparison between sexes supported the approach that women showed more sensitivity to high activation and dominance for positive emotions and empathy, and men were more sensitive to negative situations. Correlation analysis showed only one positive relationship between scores of Self-transcendence, a subscale of Temperament and Character Inventory, with activation scores of neutral situations, but not with emotionally charged situations, perhaps because emotions are context-dependent processes while personality traits are considered context-independent descriptions of habits. These findings should be replicated to enrich knowledge about problems in emotional processing.",

    "abstract": "Music reduces pain in fibromyalgia (FM), a chronic pain disease, but the functional neural correlates of music-induced analgesia (MIA) are still largely unknown. We recruited FM patients (n = 22) who listened to their preferred relaxing music and an auditory control (pink noise) for 5 min without external noise from fMRI image acquisition. Resting state fMRI was then acquired before and after the music and control conditions. A significant increase in the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations of the BOLD signal was evident in the left angular gyrus (lAnG) after listening to music, which in turn, correlated to the analgesia reports. The post-hoc seed-based functional connectivity analysis of the lAnG showed found higher connectivity after listening to music with right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rdlPFC), the left caudate (lCau), and decreased connectivity with right anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), right supplementary motor area (rSMA), precuneus and right precentral gyrus (rPreG). Pain intensity (PI) analgesia was correlated (r = 0.61) to the connectivity of the lAnG with the rPreG. Our results show that MIA in FM is related to top-down regulation of the pain modulatory network by the default mode network (DMN).",

    "abstract": "The present study evaluated images of environments in three categories with different affective and restorative valences through two computerized assessments. A non-verbal computerized response scale and the Mexican Scale of Environmental Restoration Perception were employed. 104 students assessed the affective qualities of 117 images (47 natural, 37 urban with nature, and 33 built-up without nature) according to pleasure and activation dimensions. Then 96 students assessed 54 images with high and low valence for their restorative quality. Natural images were found to generate positive affective reactions of liking and activation and high restorative quality. Affective responses to urban with nature environments tended to be positive with moderate restorative quality. Built-up without nature environments were perceived as less pleasant and had low restorative quality. However, among built-up without nature environments, some settings with striking architectural qualities evoked positive affective valences.",

    "abstract": "Compassion is a prototypical moral emotion supporting cooperation and involves empathic decision-making and motor processes representing the interplay of biologically evolved and cultural mechanisms. We propose a social neuroscience approach to identify gender differences and to assess biological and cultural factors shaping compassion. We consider the police force as a cultural model to study this emotion, because it comprises a mixed-gender group using specific codes for collective safety that influence empathy and cooperativeness. From a sample of Mexican police officers working in a violent environment we integrated ethnographic data categorizing compassionate elements in the officers' activities, psychometric measures evaluating empathic attitudes, and fMRI scans identifying the brain activity related to compassionate experiences and decisions. The results suggest that the police culture influences genders equally with respect to empathic behavioral expressions. Nevertheless, women showed insular and prefrontal cortical activation, suggesting a more empathic experience of compassion. Officers manifested activity in the caudate nucleus, amygdala, and cerebellum, suggesting a more a highly accurate process to infer another's suffering and a reward system motivated by the notion of service and cooperation, both of which are cultural traits represented in the police force.",

    "abstract": "Visuospatial working memory refers to the short-term storage and manipulation of visuospatial information. To study the neural bases of these processes, 17 participants took part in a modified sequential Vernier task while they were being scanned using an event-related functional MRI protocol. During each trial, participants retained the spatial position of a line during a delay period to later evaluate if it was presented aligned to a second line. This design allowed testing the manipulation of the spatial information from memory. During encoding, there was a larger parietal and cingulate activation under the experimental condition, whereas the opposite was true for the occipital cortex. Throughout the delay period of the experimental condition there was significant bilateral activation in the caudal superior frontal sulcus/middle frontal gyrus, as well as the insular and superior parietal lobes, which confirms the findings from previous studies. During manipulation of spatial memory, the analysis showed higher activation in the lingual gyrus. This increase of activity in visual areas during the manipulation phase fits with the hypothesis that information stored in sensory cortices becomes reactivated once the information is needed to be utilized.",

    "abstract": "Music and speech are two of the most relevant and common sounds in the human environment. Perceiving and processing these two complex acoustical signals rely on a hierarchical functional network distributed throughout several brain regions within and beyond the auditory cortices. Given their similarities, the neural bases for processing these two complex sounds overlap to a certain degree, but particular brain regions may show selectivity for one or the other acoustic category, which we aimed to identify. We examined 53 subjects (28 of them professional musicians) by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), using a paradigm designed to identify regions showing increased activity in response to different types of musical stimuli, compared to different types of complex sounds, such as speech and non-linguistic vocalizations. We found a region in the anterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus (aSTG) (planum polare) that showed preferential activity in response to musical stimuli and was present in all our subjects, regardless of musical training, and invariant across different musical instruments (violin, piano or synthetic piano). Our data show that this cortical region is preferentially involved in processing musical, as compared to other complex sounds, suggesting a functional role as a second-order relay, possibly integrating acoustic characteristics intrinsic to music (e.g., melody extraction). Moreover, we assessed whether musical experience modulates the response of cortical regions involved in music processing and found evidence of functional differences between musicians and non-musicians during music listening. In particular, bilateral activation of the planum polare was more prevalent, but not exclusive, in musicians than non-musicians, and activation of the right posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus (planum temporale) differed between groups. Our results provide evidence of functional specialization for music processing in specific regions of the auditory cortex and show domain-specific functional differences possibly correlated with musicianship.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the relationship between structural characteristics (area) and microstructure (apparent diffusion coefficient; ADC) of the corpus callosum (CC) in 57 healthy children aged 7.0 to 9.1 years, with diverse cognitive and academic abilities as well as executive functions evaluated with a neuropsychological battery for children. The CC was manually delineated and sub-segmented into six regions, and their ADC and area were measured. There were no significant differences between genders in the callosal region area or in ADC. The CC area and ADC, mainly of anterior regions, correlated with different cognitive abilities for each gender. Our results suggest that the relationship between cognitive abilities and CC characteristics is different between girls and boys and between the anterior and posterior regions of the CC. Furthermore, these findings strenghten the idea that regardless of the different interhemispheric connectivity schemes per gender, the results of cognitive tasks are very similar for girls and boys throughout childhood.",

    "abstract": "In order to explore the neurobiological foundations of qualitative subjective experiences, the present study was designed to correlate objective third-person brain fMRI measures with subjective first-person identification and scaling of local, subtle, and specific somatosensory sensations, obtained directly after the imaging procedure. Thus, thirty-four volunteers were instructed to focus and sustain their attention to either provoked or spontaneous sensations of each thumb during the fMRI procedure. By means of a Likert scale applied immediately afterwards, the participants recalled and evaluated the intensity of their attention and identified specific somatosensory sensations (e.g. pulsation, vibration, heat). Using the subject's subjective scores as covariates to model both attention intensity and general somatosensory experiences regressors, the whole-brain random effect analyses revealed activations in the frontopolar prefrontal cortex (BA10), primary somatosensory cortex (BA1), premotor cortex (BA 6), precuneus (BA 7), temporopolar cortex (BA 38), inferior parietal lobe (BA 39), hippocampus, insula and amygdala. Furthermore, BA10 showed differential activity, with ventral BA10 correlating exclusively with attention (r(32)\u200a=\u200a0.54, p\u200a=\u200a0.0013) and dorsal BA10 correlating exclusively with somatosensory sensation (r(32)\u200a=\u200a0.46, p\u200a=\u200a0.007). All other reported brain areas showed significant positive correlations solely with subjective somatosensory experiences reports. These results provide evidence that the frontopolar prefrontal cortex has dissociable functions depending on specific cognitive demands; i.e. the dorsal portion of the frontopolar prefrontal cortex in conjunction with primary somatosensory cortex, temporopolar cortex, inferior parietal lobe, hippocampus, insula and amygdala are involved in the processing of spontaneous general subjective somatosensory experiences disclosed by focused and sustained attention.",

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity in childhood is associated with negative physical and psychological effects. It has been proposed that obesity increase the risk for developing cognitive deficits, dementia and Alzheimer's disease and that it may be associated with marked differences in specific brain structure volumes.\nThe purpose of this study was a neurobiopsychological approach to examine the association between overweight and obesity, brain structure and a paediatric neuropsychological assessment in Mexican children between 6 and 8\u2009years of age.\nWe investigated the relation between the body mass index (BMI), brain volumetric segmentation of subcortical gray and white matter regions obtained with magnetic resonance imaging and the Neuropsychological Assessment of Children standardized for Latin America. Thirty-three healthy Mexican children between 6 and 8 years of age, divided into normal weight (18 children) and overweight/obese (15 children) groups.\nOverweight/obese children showed reduced executive cognitive performance on neuropsychological evaluations (i.e. verbal fluidity, P\u2009=\u20090.03) and presented differences in brain structures related to learning and memory (reduced left hippocampal volumes, P\u2009=\u20090.04) and executive functions (larger white matter volumes in the left cerebellum, P\u2009=\u20090.04 and mid-posterior corpus callosum, P\u2009=\u20090.03). Additionally, we found a positive correlation between BMI and left globulus pallidus (P\u2009=\u20090.012, \u03c1\u2009=\u20090.43) volume and a negative correlation between BMI and neuropsychological evaluation scores (P\u2009=\u20090.033, \u03c1\u2009=\u2009-0.37).\nThe findings contribute to the idea that there is a relationship between BMI, executive cognitive performance and brain structure that may underlie the causal chain that leads to obesity in adulthood.",

    "abstract": "The present experiment was designed to test if sustained attention directed to the spontaneous sensations of the right or left thumb in the absence of any external stimuli is able to activate corresponding somatosensory brain areas. After verifying in 34 healthy volunteers that external touch stimuli to either thumb effectively activate brain contralateral somatosensory areas, and after subtracting attention mechanisms employed in both touch and spontaneous-sensation conditions, fMRI evidence was obtained that the primary somatosensory cortex (specifically left BA 3a/3b) becomes active when an individual is required to attend to the spontaneous sensations of either thumb in the absence of external stimuli. In addition, the left superior parietal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, motor and premotor cortex, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, Broca's area, and occipital cortices were activated. Moreover, attention to spontaneous-sensations revealed an increased connectivity between BA 3a/3b, superior frontal gyrus (BA 9) and anterior cingulate cortex (BA 32), probably allowing top-down activations of primary somatosensory cortex. We conclude that specific primary somatosensory areas in conjunction with other left parieto-frontal areas are involved in processing proprioceptive and interoceptive bodily information that underlies own body-representations and that these networks and cognitive functions can be modulated by top-down attentional processes.",

    "abstract": "The pain in Fibromyalgia (FM) is difficult to treat and functional mobility seems to be an important comorbidity in these patients that could evolve into a disability. In this study we wanted to investigate the analgesic effects of music in FM pain. Twenty-two FM patients were passively exposed to (1) self-chosen, relaxing, pleasant music, and to (2) a control auditory condition (pink noise). They rated pain and performed the \"timed-up & go task (TUG)\" to measure functional mobility after each auditory condition. Listening to relaxing, pleasant, self-chosen music reduced pain and increased functional mobility significantly in our FM patients. The music-induced analgesia was significantly correlated with the TUG scores; thereby suggesting that the reduction in pain unpleasantness increased functional mobility. Notably, this mobility improvement was obtained with music played prior to the motor task (not during), therefore the effect cannot be explained merely by motor entrainment to a fast rhythm. Cognitive and emotional mechanisms seem to be central to music-induced analgesia. Our findings encourage the use of music as a treatment adjuvant to reduce chronic pain in FM and increase functional mobility thereby reducing the risk of disability.",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive ataxia and retinal dystrophy. It is caused by a CAG trinucleotide expansion in the ataxin7 gene. Anatomical studies have shown severe cerebellar degeneration and region-specific neocortical atrophy in SCA7 patients. However, the impact of the neurodegeneration on the functional integration of the remaining tissue is still unknown. The aim of this study was to examine functional connectivity abnormalities in areas with significant gray matter atrophy in SCA7 patients and their relationship with number of CAG repeats. Using a combination of voxel-based morphometry and resting-state fMRI, we studied 26 genetically confirmed SCA7 patients and aged-matched healthy controls. In SCA7 patients we found reduced functional interaction between the cerebellum and the middle and superior frontal gyri, disrupted functional connectivity between the visual and motor cortices, and increased functional coordination between atrophied areas of the cerebellum and a range of visual cortical areas compared with healthy controls. The degree of mutation expansion showed a negative effect on both the functional interaction between the right anterior cerebellum and the left superior frontal gyrus and the connectivity between the right anterior cerebellum and left parahippocampal gyrus. We found abnormal functional connectivity patterns, including both hypo- and hyperconnectivity, compared with controls. These abnormal patterns show reasonable association with the severity of gene mutation. Our findings suggest that aberrant changes are prevalent in both motor and visual systems, adding significantly to our understanding of the pathophysiology of SCA7.",

    "abstract": "Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms are manifested in social dynamics. In this study, the brain activity of eight child and adolescent patients diagnosed with ADHD was examined while they performed the Counting Stroop task and results were interpreted using social neuroscience premises. Brain activity was identified in frontal, parietal, and temporal regions related to the orienting system of attention and with linguistic, facial recognition, and mnemonic processes. Consistent with previous reports, these patients showed no activation in prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices related to the executive system of attention. Also, they manifested activation in the insular cortex involving interoceptive processes that may be associated with impulsiveness. Global brain activity involves a network formed during early development and includes experiential components such as learning of rules, reward systems, empathy, and decision making. An integrative assessment of ADHD should consider psychosocial and neurobiological causes integrated into an individual's own experiences assembled throughout life.",

Although a plethora of information on its functional relevance has been generated, little is known about lateralization or hemisphere asymmetry within the DMN. We used high-resolution resting state fMRI and T1 3D data to investigate such asymmetries in two groups of healthy subjects, one right-handed and one left-handed. Independent component analysis and the dual regression approach were carried out to identify functional asymmetries, while voxel-based morphometry was used to identify structural asymmetries in grey matter volume within the DMN. Greater leftward functional connectivity was observed in the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) for both groups. Leftward functional asymmetry was observed in the thalamus and rightward functional asymmetries were observed in the middle frontal and middle/superior temporal gyrus in the right-handed group. Rightward asymmetries in grey matter volume were observed in the posterior portion of the PCG for both groups. The right-handed group exhibited leftward structural asymmetries in the anterior portion of the PCG and in the middle frontal and posterior portion of the middle temporal gyrus, while rightward asymmetries were observed in the posterior portion of the PCG and anterior portions of temporal regions. These results suggest that functional connectivity and grey matter volume are not equally distributed between hemispheres within the DMN, and that functional asymmetries are not always reflected or determined by structural asymmetries.",

    "abstract": "Food intake fluctuates throughout the menstrual cycle; it is greater during the early follicular and luteal phases than in the late follicular (periovulatory) phase. Ovarian steroids can influence brain areas that process food-related information, but the specific contribution of individual hormones and the importance of the prandial state remain unknown.\nThe objective was to examine whether brain activation during food visualization is affected by changes in estradiol concentration in the fasted and fed conditions.\nNine eumenorrheic, lean young women [mean (\u00b1SD) age: 26.2 \u00b1 3.2 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 22.4 \u00b1 1.2] completed 2 visits, one in the early (low estradiol) and one in the late (high estradiol) follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. At each visit, subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while they viewed food and nonfood images, before and after a standardized meal. Region-of-interest analysis was used to examine the effect of follicular phase and prandial state on brain activation (food > nonfood contrast) and its association with estradiol concentration.\nDifferences were identified in the inferior frontal and fusiform gyri. In these areas, visualization of food elicited greater activation in the fed state than during fasting but only in the late follicular phase, when estradiol concentration was high. The change in estradiol concentration across the follicular phase (late minus early) was inversely correlated with the change in fusiform gyrus activation in the fasted state but not in the fed state.\nOur findings suggest that estradiol may reduce food intake by decreasing sensitivity to food cues in the ventral visual pathway under conditions of energy deprivation. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00130117.",

    "abstract": "Compassion is considered a moral emotion related to the perception of suffering in others, and resulting in a motivation to alleviate the afflicted party. We compared brain correlates of compassion-evoking images in women and men. BOLD functional images of 24 healthy volunteers (twelve women and twelve men; age=27\u00b12.5 y.o.) were acquired in a 3T magnetic resonance scanner while subjects viewed pictures of human suffering previously verified to elicit compassion and indicated their compassionate experience by finger movements. Functional analysis revealed that while women manifested activation in areas involved in basic emotional, empathic, and moral processes, such as basal regions and cingulate and frontal cortices, activation in men was restricted mainly to the occipital cortex and parahippocampal gyrus. These findings suggest that compassion and its moral elements constitute gender-relative subjective phenomena emerging from differently evolved neural mechanisms and socially learned features possibly related to nurturing skills.",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia and visual loss. It is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding the ataxin 7 protein. Visual loss is due to a progressive atrophy of photoreceptor cells that results in macular degeneration in more advanced stages. Initial semiautomatic measures in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on the brain stem have shown a diminished volume mainly in the cerebellum and pons, while T2 images have shown hyperintensities in transverse fibers at the pons. Neuropathological research, however, has shown more widespread brain damage including loss of myelinated fibers. In this study we decided to take advantage of recent MRI methodological advances to further explore the gray and white matter changes that occur in SCA7 patients. We studied nine genetically confirmed SCA7 patients and their matched controls using voxel based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics. As expected, we found significant bilateral gray matter volume reductions (p<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) in patients' cerebellar cortex. However, we also found significant bilateral gray matter reductions in pre and postcentral gyrus, inferior and medial frontal, parietal inferior, parahippocampal and occipital cortices. The analysis also showed a decrement in fractional anisotropy (p<0.05, corrected) of SCA7 patients in the cerebellum's white matter, brainstem, cerebellar and cerebral peduncles, midbrain, anterior and posterior internal capsule, external/extreme capsule, corpus callosum, corona radiata, optical radiations, and the occipital, temporal and frontal lobe's white matter. These results confirm previous evidence of widespread damage beyond the cerebellum and the pons in SCA7 patients. They also confirmed previous results that had been only detectable through neuropathological analyses and, more importantly, identified new regions affected by the disease that previous methods could not detect. These new results could help explain the symptom's spectrum that affects these patients.",

    "abstract": "Phantom limb (PL), a phenomenon experienced by most patients after amputation, has mostly served as a paradigm to study experiences that appear to be associated with neural plasticity within the CNS. However, the subjective nature of PL experiences has had no definitive means of reliable assessment other than using patients' direct reports, nor was there a way to study the neural mechanisms involved in the conscious awareness of this mental phenomenon. Here we obtained patients' indirect responses to PL experiences for an objective evaluation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Six control subjects and six lower limb (LL) amputees participated in a motor imagery task for both the intact and the particular phantom toes. While all subjects shared neural processing of distinctive regional cerebral activations during motor imagery of the intact toes (prefrontal (PF), supplementary motor area (SMA), primary motor cortex (M1), superior temporal gyrus (STG)), it was only during motor imagery of the amputated toes in amputees that we observed an increased blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the contralateral basal ganglia at the medial globus pallidus (MGP), substantia nigra (SN), and thalamus. This increased BOLD signal in the basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex pathway during imaginary movement of the phantom toes may reflect an abnormal open loop functioning of the thalamocortical system underlying the conscious awareness of the phantom phenomenon. We suggest that the reduction in afferent information contributes to and coalesces with the higher-level reorganization resulting in the subjective conscious awareness of the phantom limb.",

    "abstract": "The phantom limb phenomenon has been used in amputee patients as a paradigm to study plasticity, mainly of the sensorimotor cortex. Nevertheless, most functional studies have been done in upper limb amputee patients using magnetoencephalography and functional magnetic resonance image imaging (fMRI). In addition, the actual experience of phantom limb sensation has not been widely used to study the neural mechanism of the human brain as a conscious knowledge of the phantom limb perception like the integration of the body image in amputee patients. fMRI studies of patients with lower limb amputation have recently been published, but none of these used an event-related design to try to observe only the stimulus application, correlating images with the subject's indication of phantom perception and discarding images with no phantom perception. In this work, we used the event-related fMRI design in two right-handed patients with identical right, transfemoral amputations, performing the same sensitive stimulation in a 3.0 T MR scanner. For comparison, we applied the same paradigm to six control subjects to compare the resulting functional maps. We found areas with statistical significance in the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the site of stimulation, in the parietal lobe in Brodmann areas 3 in both cases (Patients and Control Subjects), but we also found activation in the Brodmann areas 6, 40, and 5 with stimulation of the stump. We observed a specific activation of the frontoparietal circuit during phantom limb perception in both amputee patients.",

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease is an hereditary autosomic-dominant neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms.\nTo quantify differences in N-acetylaspartate, creatine and choline in caudate nucleus, putamen and occipital cortex of patients with Huntington's disease, symptomatics and asymptomatics.\nHydrogen magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed with a 3 T scanner in 10 Huntington's disease gene-tested subjects, included in three groups: negative (control), positive symptomatics and positive asymptomatics. Data was quantified with LCModel and analyzed with ANOVA and Fisher tests.\nSymptomatic patients showed decreased creatine and N-acetylaspartate in the three regions, and decreased choline only in putamen (p < 0.05). Choline difference was found between symptomatics and asymptomatics in the caudate nucleus (p < 0.05).\nResults may reflect neuronal dysfunction and suggest that creatine and choline may serve as markers for Huntington's disease progression.",

To evaluate the behavioral and neural substrates associated with the performance of a short-term memory task in female ADHD adults, with and without methylphenidate exposure, with respect to a control group.\nTwo groups of eight young right-handed, female, university students with ADHD and healthy controls matched by age, gender, handedness and academic level, voluntarily participated. All subjects performed twice an easy auditory short-term memory task (ADHD group without, and 90 minutes post-intake of methylphenidate 0.4 mg/kg in a counterbalanced order). The BOLD-fMRI response was used as a measure of neural activity during task performance.\nADHD subjects showed a tendency to improve their performances under medication, showing an increased widespread functional activation, especially relevant over left frontal and cerebellar areas, in comparison with control subjects.\nMethylphenidate slightly improves short-term memory task performance in adult female ADHD subjects by modifying underlying neural functioning patterns.",

    "abstract": "Potential sex differences in EEG coherent activity during pleasant and unpleasant musical emotions were investigated. Musical excerpts by Mahler, Bach, and Prodromid\u00e8s were played to seven men and seven women and their subjective emotions were evaluated in relation to alpha band intracortical coherence. Different brain links in specific frequencies were associated to pleasant and unpleasant emotions. Pleasant emotions (Mahler, Bach) increased upper alpha couplings linking left anterior and posterior regions. Unpleasant emotions (Prodromid\u00e8s) were sustained by posterior midline coherence exclusively in the right hemisphere in men and bilateral in women. Combined music induced bilateral oscillations among posterior sensory and predominantly left association areas in women. Consistent with their greater positive attributions to music, the coherent network is larger in women, both for musical emotion and for unspecific musical effects. Musical emotion entails specific coupling among cortical regions and involves coherent upper alpha activity between posterior association areas and frontal regions probably mediating emotional and perceptual integration. Linked regions by combined music suggest more working memory contribution in women and attention in men.",

    "abstract": "This paper had as goals to identify the presence of age indicators in the mandibular ramus and to study their applicability in estimating the chronological age of children between the ages of 6 and 12 years. For this, a sample of 128 individuals (70 males and 58 females) was selected, all without chronic or acute sicknesses. An evaluation was made of the metric and angular variables of the mandibular ramus on panoramic radiographs of the oral cavity. The Greulich-Pyle method was applied to estimate the skeletal age, and the Demirjian et al. method was applied to estimate the dental age. A positive correlation, statistically significant, could be observed between the metric variables studied and the chronological age; nevertheless, the angular variables did not show correlation with the chronological age. Regression models were built using metric variables of the mandibular ramus in order to estimate the age, which made a significant contribution to the calculation of the age. A consistent subestimation of the skeletal age and an overestimation of the dental age were found in both sexes. It was evident that a combination of the dental age, the skeletal age and the metric variables obtained in the mandibular ramus, increases the precision for calculating the chronological age, when compared to separate-made estimations of the dental and skeletal age. The proposed regression models can be used for estimating the age of cadavers in advanced states of decomposition and in living individuals without valid identification documents.",

Pictures showing suffering in social contexts and expressions of sadness elicited similar responses of compassion. The highest compassion response was reported for pictures showing illness and pain. Men and women differed in the intensity but not the quality of the compassionate responses. Compassion included attributes of negative emotions such as displeasure. The quality of the emotional response was not different from that previously reported for samples in the U.S.A., Spain, and Brazil. A set of 28 pictures was selected as high-compassion-evoking images and 28 as null-compassion controls suitable for studies designed to ascertain the neural substrates of this moral emotion.",

    "abstract": "Brain correlates comparing pleasant and unpleasant states induced by three dissimilar masterpiece excerpts were obtained. Related emotional reactions to the music were studied using Principal Component Analysis of validated reports, fMRI, and EEG coherent activity. A piano selection by Bach and a symphonic passage from Mahler widely differing in musical features were used as pleasing pieces. A segment by Prodromid\u00e8s was used as an unpleasing stimulus. Ten consecutive 30 s segments of each piece alternating with random static noise were played to 19 non-musician volunteers for a total of 30 min of auditory stimulation. Both brain approaches identified a left cortical network involved with pleasant feelings (Bach and Mahler vs. Prodromid\u00e8s) including the left primary auditory area, posterior temporal, inferior parietal and prefrontal regions. While the primary auditory zone may provide an early affective quality, left cognitive areas may contribute to pleasant feelings when melodic sequences follow expected rules. In contrast, unpleasant emotions (Prodromid\u00e8s vs. Bach and Mahler) involved the activation of the right frontopolar and paralimbic areas. Left activation with pleasant and right with unpleasant musical feelings is consistent with right supremacy in novel situations and left in predictable processes. When all musical excerpts were jointly compared to noise, in addition to bilateral auditory activation, the left temporal pole, inferior frontal gyrus, and frontopolar area were activated suggesting that cognitive and language processes were recruited in general responses to music. Sensory and cognitive integration seems required for musical emotion.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory deficits are present in many neurodegenerative diseases. It is not known, however, whether the olfactory deterioration is caused by a common neural deficit, or whether it is unique to each disease. We report here the effect of degeneration of different brain structures on olfactory impairment in Huntington's disease as determined by voxel-based morphometric analysis. The structures with the greatest effect on the olfactory deficit were the entorhinal cortex, the thalamus, the parahippocampal gyrus, and the caudate nucleus. Although various neuroimaging studies have shown previously that the caudate nucleus is involved in olfaction, this is the first demonstration that it is related to an olfactory dysfunction in a neurodegenerative disease. The results are discussed in relation to other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The present study evaluated four different clinically relevant statistical approaches with respect to a response to a visual stimulus paradigm. Healthy volunteers were subjected to a visual stimulus consisting of a checkerboard black-and-white box car pattern with on-off blocks of 10s. Simultaneously, sensitivity encoding (SENSE) dynamic MR imaging was acquired using a 1.5 T MR system. Statistical analyses were conducted with z-cluster analysis, Student's t-test, Spearman's correlation, and time-series normalized cross-correlation. A figure-of-merit for neural activity was measured from calculated maps using pixel counting. The results demonstrated that the index of activity estimated from the number of \"activated\" pixels did not differ markedly among the four different statistical methods, except when comparing the cross-correlation statistics with z-clustering in the whole brain, implying that all methods lead to similar statistical information when using fMRI to map the activity of the visual cortex in response to a visual stimulus.",

    "abstract": "In this study, seven fruits have been tested on their magnetic properties, paramagnetic metal content and contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of phantom and in vivo. Magnetic susceptibility was determined for the fruit pulps, as well as the contents of paramagnetic metals; iron, manganese and copper. The total content of these metals was 4.3, 8.6, 11.1, 10.9, 12.3, 8.3 and 29.3 mg/kg of fruit for plum, blueberry, apple (red), pineapple, beet, grape, blackberry, respectively, and with magnetic susceptibility of -2.29+/-0.07, -2.43+/-0.07, -2.13+/-0.07, -1.84+/-0.02, -1.75+/-0.01, -1.78+/-0.06, -2.18+/-0.07 SI, respectively. T(1)- and T(2)-weighted MR images were performed for the seven fruits and water (chi= -9.98 x 10(-3) SI) and in one subject. While there was no correlation between the magnetic susceptibility and contrast enhancement, there is a correlation with the total paramagnetic metal content determined with contrast enhancement in MRI. Thus, blackberry (Rubus spp.) contrast enhancement was the highest among the fruits in T(1)-weighted images. Furthermore, this fruit's contrast enhancement shows to be pH-dependent. These characteristics and the wide availability of the Rubus spp. suggest that it should be implemented as an oral contrast agent in images by MR to assess the function of the gastric section of the GI tract. Furthermore, it has the advantage of being a natural meal, so that it can be well tolerated by the patients and use as much as it is needed without side effects.",

    "abstract": "A surface coil for MRI was designed and built based on the principles of the petal resonator proposed by Mansfield [J Phys D Appl Phys 21 (1988) 1643]. This resonator coil design was named the petal resonator surface (PERES) coil and is composed of an eight-petal coil array and a central circular coil. A minimum separation of three times the petal coil radius is necessary to significantly decrease the mutual inductance. An analytical function for the PERES Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is obtained based on the quasistatic method. Theoretical plots of SNR enhancement yielded 26% and 35% more SNR over the circular coil and phased-array coils. Imaging experiments were first performed using a spectroscopy phantom on a 1.5-T commercial imager. Subsequently, brain images of healthy volunteers were obtained. Clinical MR imager compatibility allows this resonator coil to be used with conventional pulse sequences and imaging protocols. This coil design offers a new alternative to existing surface coils because it significantly increases the SNR.",

    "abstract": "The development of clinical magnetic resonance imaging in Mexico has followed a different course from that in the U.S. and Europe. The first clinical unit was installed in Mexico in the late 1980s at the very beginning of clinical applications worldwide. Since then, installations have proceeded at a sedate pace that now brings the installed total to 66 imagers. The largest fraction of these units (28, or 42%) is in Mexico City, with a broad distribution across the remaining 23 Mexican states. There is a noticeable increase of the number of units (20, or 30%) in the states bordering the U.S., while the states bordering nations to the south have no units. More than half the units (38, or 58%) are 0.5 T units, while a further 35% are 1.0 T or higher. Slower addition of units in Mexico relative to the U.S. is attributed to the higher fraction of public-funded hospitals and the inherent conservatism of such institutions when considering new technologies. Present public planning for health care development suggests that the coming decade will see more rapid installation of units to meet growing demand in Mexico for the latest medical technology. Experience over the past two decades indicates the need for more systematic training of technical and clinical personnel to implement these additions. The National University (Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM) and the Metropolitan University (Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana (UAM) are collaborating with diverse clinical facilities to create such a program.

    "abstract": "Reports on phantom limb patients concerning neuronal reorganization using non-invasive methods have focused mainly on the cortical regions and suggest the presence of pain as the cause of this reorganization. The phantom limb, however, includes other somatic and motor sensations other than pain. Here we describe the results of non-painful stimulation in cortical and subcortical lateralization and reorganization and also examine the involvement of subcortical structures in phantom limb telescoping perception. We describe an enlarged contralateral cortical representation of the stump, a cortical and thalamic bilateral representation of the remaining leg, and a neuronal correlate of a telescoping perception of the phantom limb. The missing leg produces an enlarged cortical representation due to abnormal information and the remaining leg has a bilateral SII representation, which could be related to new, compensatory functions. The telescoping perception of a phantom limb by the stimulation of misallocation points was correlated with lenticular nuclei, thalamic and cingulate gyrus activation. We therefore propose that the reorganization concept of a phantom limb, applied mainly to the cortex, must extend to the thalamic and the somatosensory and motor systems (pathways and relay nuclei).",

    "abstract": "The cornea is an avascular organ, where induction of new blood vessels involves the turn-on of proangiogenic factors and/or the turn-off of antiangiogenic regulators. Prolactin (PRL) fragments of 14 kDa and 16 kDa bind to endothelial cell receptors and inhibit angiogenesis. This study was designed to determine whether antiangiogenic PRL-like molecules are involved in cornea avascularity.\nSixteen-kDa PRL and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or anti-PRL antibodies were placed into rat cornea micropockets and neovascularization evaluated by the optical density associated with capillaries stained by the peroxidase reaction and by the number of vessels growing into the implants. Prolactin receptors in corneal epithelium were investigated by immunocytochemistry.\nbFGF induced a dose-dependent stimulation of corneal neovascularization. This effect was inhibited by coadministration of 16-kDa PRL, as indicated by a 65% reduction in vessel density and a 50% decrement in the incidence of angiogenic responses. Corneal angiogenic reactions of different intensities were induced by implantation of polyclonal and monoclonal anti-PRL antibodies. Corneal epithelial cells were labeled by several anti-PRL receptor monoclonal antibodies.\nThese findings show that exogenous 16-kDa PRL inhibits bFGF-induced corneal neovascularization and suggest that PRL-like molecules with antiangiogenic actions function in the cornea. PRL receptors in the corneal epithelium may imply that PRL in the cornea derives from lacrimal PRL internalized through an intracellular pathway. These observations are consistent with the notion that members of the PRL family are potential regulators of corneal angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "In embryos of different reptile species, incubation temperature triggers a cascade of endocrine events that lead to gonad sex differentiation. The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which temperature sets in motion this process are still controversial. Here, we begin evaluating the possible participation of the nervous system in temperature-dependent sex determination by showing the existence and origin of acetylcholinesterase (AchE)-positive nerve fibers in undifferentiated gonads of the Lepidochelys olivacea (L. olivacea) sea turtle putative male and female embryos, along the thermosensitive period for sex determination (TPSD; stages 20-27). AChE-positive nerve bundles and fibers were readily visualized until developmental stage 24 and thereafter. DiI injections and confocal imaging showed that some of these gonadal nerves arise from the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord levels, and might thus be sensory in nature. Because the vertebrate spinal cord is capable of integrating by itself thermoregulatory responses with no intervention of uppermost levels of the central nervous system, we also evaluated spinal cord maturation during the TPSD. The maturation of the spinal cord was more advanced in putative female than in male embryos, when sex determination is taking place for each sex; this process starts and ends earlier in male than in female embryos. Together these observations open the possibility that the spinal cord and the innervation derived from it could play a direct role in driving or modulating the process of temperature-dependent gonad sex determination and/or differentiation, particularly in female L. olivacea embryos.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that evoked neural activity levels promote the selective construction of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) neuropil. Sensory deprivation after S1 formation has, however, no effects on its postnatal growth. This indicates that S1 neuropil elaboration is independent from the ongoing levels of evoked cortical activity, and/or that sensory deprivation does not reduce overall levels of S1 evoked activity. We thus indirectly evaluated chronic and acute levels of neural activity in the developmentally, sensory deprived adult S1. Relative succinic dehydrogenase activity and 3H2-deoxyglucose uptake were comparable in control and deprived barrels. Our observations support the idea that normal levels of evoked neural activity prevent atrophic changes in the developmentally deprived adult S1. They can not rule out, however, that early selective S1 neuropil construction occurs independent from evoked neural activity levels.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) modulates neural activity in vivo, relative levels of brain [3H]2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake were compared in adult behaving and anesthetized wild type (wt) mice, and transgenic (Tg) mice with either brain IGF-I overexpression or ectopic brain expression of IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1). Overall, awake behaving IGF-I Tg mice showed significant increases in brain 2DG uptake compared with wt and IGFBP-1 Tg mice. These differences were eliminated after anesthesia. 2DG uptake was similar in awake behaving, and anesthetized wt and IGFBP-1 Tg mice. Our observations thus suggest that IGF-I increases neural activity levels in vivo, and that it is not involved in regulating glucose consumption in the adult brain.",

Fast gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state technique was used to study five healthy subjects during visual activation and a control dark state. MR images were obtained every 2.048 seconds for 2 minutes. A bolus of gadopentetate dimeglumine was injected during visual stimulation and darkness. Cine images produced from the series of rapid images clearly depicted arterial, capillary, and venous phases. Analysis of serial concentration maps derived from the rapid images revealed expected differences between the relative CBV of gray matter and that of white matter, as well as significantly increased relative CBV in calcarine cortex during visual activation versus the control state (mean increase, 15.24%; range, 6.41%-27.78%; P < .05). These results confirm those reported in echo-planar imaging studies and demonstrate that brain function can be assessed with the bolus method by means of MR imaging hardware and software with conventional clinical configurations.",
