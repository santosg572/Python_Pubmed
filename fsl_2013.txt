    "abstract": "We investigated the question of whether cholesterol catabolite can influence expression of inflammatory cytokines via Toll-like receptors (TLR) in monocytic cells. Treatment of THP-1 monocytic cells with 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHChol) resulted in induction of gene transcription of TLR6 and elevated level of cell surface TLR6. Addition of FSL-1, a TLR6 agonist, to 27OHChol-treated cells resulted in transcription of the IL-1\u03b1 gene and enhanced secretion of the corresponding gene product. However, cholesterol did not affect TLR6 expression, and addition of FSL-1 to cholesterol-treated cells did not induce expression of IL-1\u03b1. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we investigated molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of TLR6 and IL-1\u03b1. Treatment with Akt inhibitor IV or U0126 resulted in significantly attenuated expression of TLR6 and IL-1\u03b1 induced by 27OHChol and 27OHChol plus FSL-1, respectively. In addition, treatment with LY294002, SB202190, or SP600125 resulted in significantly attenuated secretion of IL-1\u03b1. These results indicate that 27OHChol can induce inflammation by augmentation of TLR6-mediated production of IL-1\u03b1 in monocytic cells via multiple signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Accurate brain tissue segmentation from magnetic resonance (MR) images is an important step in analysis of cerebral images. There are software packages which are used for brain segmentation. These packages usually contain a set of skull stripping, intensity non-uniformity (bias) correction and segmentation routines. Thus, assessment of the quality of the segmented gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is needed for the neuroimaging applications.\nIn this paper, performance evaluation of three widely used brain segmentation software packages SPM8, FSL and Brainsuite is presented. Segmentation with SPM8 has been performed in three frameworks: i) default segmentation, ii) SPM8 New-segmentation and iii) modified version using hidden Markov random field as implemented in SPM8-VBM toolbox.\nThe accuracy of the segmented GM, WM and CSF and the robustness of the tools against changes of image quality has been assessed using Brainweb simulated MR images and IBSR real MR images. The calculated similarity between the segmented tissues using different tools and corresponding ground truth shows variations in segmentation results.\nA few studies has investigated GM, WM and CSF segmentation. In these studies, the skull stripping and bias correction are performed separately and they just evaluated the segmentation. Thus, in this study, assessment of complete segmentation framework consisting of pre-processing and segmentation of these packages is performed. The obtained results can assist the users in choosing an appropriate segmentation software package for the neuroimaging application of interest.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion imaging is a unique noninvasive tool to detect brain white matter trajectory and integrity in vivo. However, this technique suffers from spatial distortion and signal pileup or dropout originating from local susceptibility gradients and eddy currents. Although there are several methods to mitigate these problems, most techniques can be applicable either to susceptibility or eddy-current induced distortion alone with a few exceptions. The present study compared the correction efficiency of FSL tools, \"eddy_correct\" and the combination of \"eddy\" and \"topup\" in terms of diffusion-derived fractional anisotropy (FA). The brain diffusion images were acquired from 10 healthy subjects using 30 and 60 directions encoding schemes based on the electrostatic repulsive forces. For the 30 directions encoding, 2 sets of diffusion images were acquired with the same parameters, except for the phase-encode blips which had opposing polarities along the anteroposterior direction. For the 60 directions encoding, non-diffusion-weighted and diffusion-weighted images were obtained with forward phase-encoding blips and non-diffusion-weighted images with the same parameter, except for the phase-encode blips, which had opposing polarities. FA images without and with distortion correction were compared in a voxel-wise manner with tract-based spatial statistics. We showed that images corrected with eddy and topup possessed higher FA values than images uncorrected and corrected with eddy_correct with trilinear (FSL default setting) or spline interpolation in most white matter skeletons, using both encoding schemes. Furthermore, the 60 directions encoding scheme was superior as measured by increased FA values to the 30 directions encoding scheme, despite comparable acquisition time. This study supports the combination of eddy and topup as a superior correction tool in diffusion imaging rather than the eddy_correct tool, especially with trilinear interpolation, using 60 directions encoding scheme.",

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is known to be implicated in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory disorders. FSL-1 (fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1) induces cytokine production by monocytes/macrophages. However, it is unclear whether FSL-1 is also able to induce MMP-9 production. Herein, we determined whether FSL-1 could induce MMP-9 production, and if so, which signal transduction pathway(s) were involved.\nMMP-9 expression was assessed with real-time qPCR and ELISA. Signaling pathways were studied by using THP1-XBlue\u2122 cells, THP1-XBlue\u2122-defMyD cells, anti-TLR2 mAb and pharmacological inhibitors. Phospho and total proteins were determined by Western blotting.\nFSL-1 induces MMP-9 expression (P<0.001) at both mRNA and protein levels in human monocytic THP-1 cells. Elevated activity (P<0.001) of NF-\u03baB/AP-1 was also observed in FSL-1-treated THP-1 cells. FSL-1-induced MMP-9 secretion was markedly suppressed either by neutralizing anti-TLR-2 antibody or by inhibiting clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, MyD88(-/-) THP-1 cells did not express MMP-9 in response to FSL-1 treatment. By small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown, we also show that FSL-1-induced up-regulation of MMP-9 requires MyD88. Pre-treatment of THP-1 cells with inhibitors of JNK (SP600125), MEK/ERK (U0126; PD98056; XMD 8-92), p38 MAPK (SB203580) and NF-\u03baB (BAY11-7085, Triptolide, Resveratrol) significantly suppressed (P<0.05) MMP-9 gene expression and NF-\u03baB/AP-1 transcription factors activity.\nThese findings provide the first evidence that FSL-1 induces TLR-2-dependent MMP-9 gene expression which requires the recruitment of MyD88 and leads to activation of MEK1/2 /ERK 1/2, MEK5/ERK5, JNK, p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB/AP-1.",

    "abstract": "The back-to-back (BTB) acquisition of MP-RAGE MRI scans of the Alzheimer\u05f3s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI1) provides an excellent data set with which to check the reproducibility of brain atrophy measures. As part of ADNI1, 131 subjects received BTB MP-RAGEs at multiple time points and two field strengths of 3T and 1.5 T. As a result, high quality data from 200 subject-visit-pairs was available to compare the reproducibility of brain atrophies measured with FSL/SIENA over 12 to 18 month intervals at both 3T and 1.5 T. Although several publications have reported on the differing performance of brain atrophy measures at 3T and 1.5 T, no formal comparison of reproducibility has been published to date. Another goal was to check whether tuning SIENA options, including -B, -S, -R and the fractional intensity threshold (f) had a significant impact on the reproducibility. The BTB reproducibility for SIENA was quantified by the 50th percentile of the absolute value of the difference in the percentage brain volume change (PBVC) for the BTB MP-RAGES. At both 3T and 1.5 T the SIENA option combination of \"-B f=0.2\", which is different from the default values of f=0.5, yielded the best reproducibility as measured by the 50th percentile yielding 0.28 (0.23-0.39)% and 0.26 (0.20-0.32)%. These results demonstrated that in general 3T had no advantage over 1.5 T for the whole brain atrophy measure - at least for SIENA. While 3T MRI is superior to 1.5 T for many types of measurements, and thus worth the additional cost, brain atrophy measurement does not seem to be one of them.",

The aims of this study were to determine the effects of the TLR5 ligand flagellin and the TLR2 ligand FSL-1 on pro-inflammatory and pro-labour mediators in human fetal membranes and myometrium, and to establish whether their actions are dependent on MyD88, TRAF6 and NF-\u03baB.\nTissue explants were performed to determine the effect of flagellin and FSL-1 on pro-labour mediators in fetal membranes and myometrium. siRNA knockdown was performed in primary amnion and myometrium cells to determine the role of MyD88, TRAF6 and NF-\u03baB.\nFlagellin and FSL-1 increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8), MMP-9 expression and activity, and COX-2 expression and prostaglandin release. siRNA knockdown of TLR2 decreased FSL-1 induced production of IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, prostaglandins and MMP-9; similarly, siRNA knockdown of TLR5 decreased flagellin induced production of these pro-labour mediators. The effects of flagellin and FSL-1 are mediated by MyD88 and TRAF6, as siRNA knockdown of MyD88 and TRAF6 decreased flagellin and FSL-1 induced pro-labour mediators. Additionally, the effects of flagellin and FSL-1 are mediated via NF-\u03baB, as flagellin and FSL-1 increased NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity, and the NF-\u03baB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 attenuated flagellin and FSL-1 induced expression and secretion of pro-labour mediators.\nTLR2 engagement by the synthetic lipoprotein FSL-1 and TLR5 engagement by bacterial flagellin enhances pro-inflammatory and pro-labour mediators in human fetal membranes and myometrium via MyD88/TRAF6/NF-\u03baB.",

    "abstract": "The demonstration that humans can learn to modulate their own brain activity based on feedback of neurophysiological signals opened up exciting opportunities for fundamental and applied neuroscience. Although EEG-based neurofeedback has been long employed both in experimental and clinical investigation, functional MRI (fMRI)-based neurofeedback emerged as a promising method, given its superior spatial resolution and ability to gauge deep cortical and subcortical brain regions. In combination with improved computational approaches, such as pattern recognition analysis (e.g., Support Vector Machines, SVM), fMRI neurofeedback and brain decoding represent key innovations in the field of neuromodulation and functional plasticity. Expansion in this field and its applications critically depend on the existence of freely available, integrated and user-friendly tools for the neuroimaging research community. Here, we introduce FRIEND, a graphic-oriented user-friendly interface package for fMRI neurofeedback and real-time multivoxel pattern decoding. The package integrates routines for image preprocessing in real-time, ROI-based feedback (single-ROI BOLD level and functional connectivity) and brain decoding-based feedback using SVM. FRIEND delivers an intuitive graphic interface with flexible processing pipelines involving optimized procedures embedding widely validated packages, such as FSL and libSVM. In addition, a user-defined visual neurofeedback module allows users to easily design and run fMRI neurofeedback experiments using ROI-based or multivariate classification approaches. FRIEND is open-source and free for non-commercial use. Processing tutorials and extensive documentation are available.",

    "abstract": "One-electron reductases that reduce nitro compounds in hypoxic human tumour cells are poorly characterized, but are important for targeting hypoxia with nitroaromatic prodrugs. Fluorogenic probes with defined reductase profiles are needed to interrogate the activity of these enzymes in intact cells. In the present paper, we report a 6-nitroquinolone ester (FSL-61) as a fluorogenic probe for POR (NADPH:cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase) activity under hypoxia, and demonstrate its suitability of monitoring POR by flow cytometry. Reduction of FSL-61 by purified recombinant human POR generated the corresponding hydroxylamine, which was non-fluorescent, but was reduced further to the fluorescent amine in cells. Hydrolysis of the ester side chain facilitated cellular entrapment, enabling detection of heterogeneous POR expression in mixed populations of cells. In addition to POR, forced expression of three other diflavin reductases [MTRR (methionine synthase reductase), NDOR1 (NADPH-dependent diflavin oxidoreductase 1) and NOS2A (nitric oxide synthase 2A)] or NADPH:adrenoredoxin oxidoreductase in HCT116 cells significantly increased hypoxic activation of FSL-61. This reductase profile is similar to that for the dinitrobenzamide prodrug PR-104A under hypoxia, and fluorogenic metabolism of FSL-61 correlated significantly with PR-104A activation in a panel of 22 human tumour cell lines. The present study thus demonstrates the utility of FSL-61 for rapid and non-destructive interrogation of the activity of one-electron reductases in hypoxic cells at the single-cell level.",
