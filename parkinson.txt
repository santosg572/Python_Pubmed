    "abstract": "The study was carried out electrophysiological effects of hydrocortisone for protection on the prelimbic cortex (PrL) neurons in rats, particularly in response to high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the Caudate-Putamen nuclear complex (CPu) on the models of Parkinson's disease (PD). The study involved 19 rats of the Albino line, each weighing 250 gr. The rats were divided into three experimental groups: intact, rotenone model of Parkinson's disease (PD), and rats with PD but treated with hydrocortisone for protection. Extracellular recording was conducted to measure the impulse activity of single neurons in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) particularly in response to high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the Caudate-Putamen nuclear complex (CPu) on the models of PD and PD treated with hydrocortisone for protection. In rats with the PD model, there was a decrease in post-stimulus synaptic depressor tetanic effects compared to the norm. This means that the ability of synapses to depress their activity after stimulation was reduced in PD. Conversely, excitatory effects increased in PD rats compared to the norm. This indicates an increase in the excitatory response of neurons in the PD model. When hydrocortisone was applied in PD rats, the frequency of impulse activity dropped sharply, even falling below the levels observed in the normal condition. This indicates that hydrocortisone treatment mitigated the heightened neural activity induced by PD, possibly returning it to a more normal state. Overall, these findings suggest that PD alters synaptic responses and neural activity in the PrL, and hydrocortisone treatment seems to reverse some of these effects.",

    "abstract": "Remote programming enables physicians to adjust implantable pulse generators over the internet for patients with Parkinson disease who have undergone deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Despite these technological advances, the demand for and attitudes toward remote programming compared with standard programming among patients with Parkinson disease are still not well understood.\nThis study aims to investigate the preferences and perceptions associated with these 2 programming methods among patients with Parkinson disease through a web-based survey.\nA web-based survey was administered to 463 patients with Parkinson disease who have undergone DBS surgery. The survey aimed to assess the burdens associated with postoperative programming and to compare patients' attitudes toward the 2 different programming methods.\nA total of 225 patients completed the survey, all of whom had undergone standard programming, while 132 patients had also experienced remote programming. Among those who received standard programming, 191 (85%) patients required the support of more than 1 caregiver, 129 (58%) patients experienced over 2 days of lost work time, 98 (42%) patients incurred expenses ranging from US $42 to US $146, and 14 (6%) patients spent over US $421. Of the 132 patients who had used remote programming, 81 (62%) patients indicated a preference for remote programming in the future. However, challenges with remote programming persisted, including difficulties in obtaining official prescriptions, a lack of medical insurance coverage, and limited medical resources.\nPostoperative programming of DBS imposes significant burdens on patients and their caregivers during standard programming sessions-burdens that could be mitigated through remote programming. While patient satisfaction with remote programming is high, it is imperative for clinicians to develop personalized programming strategies tailored to the needs of different patients.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cause damage and gradual loss of neurons affecting the central nervous system. Neurodegenerative diseases are most commonly seen in the ageing process. Ageing causes increased reactive oxygen species and decreased mitochondrial ATP generation, resulting in redox imbalance and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress-generated free radicals cause damage to membrane lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading to the formation of toxic lipid aldehyde products such as 4- hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde. Several studies have shown that lipid peroxidation-derived aldehyde products form adducts with cellular proteins, altering their structure and function. Thus, these lipid aldehydes could act as secondary signaling intermediates, modifying important metabolic pathways, and contributing to the pathophysiology of several human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, they could serve as biomarkers for disease progression. This narrative review article discusses the biological and clinical significance of oxidative stress-mediated lipid peroxidation-derived lipid aldehydes in the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the complex link between vitamin D and neurological illnesses, focusing on how vitamin D affects possible risk factors, therapeutic applications, and the trajectory of the disease. An epidemiological study has linked vitamin D insufficiency to several neurological conditions, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. It is hypothesized that immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin D contribute to its neuroprotective effects. Two major mechanisms in dementia include neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Adequate levels of vitamin D have been shown in both animal models and human studies to enhance both clinical outcomes and the duration of illness in those who have it. Other ways that vitamin D contributes to its therapeutic potential include the production of neurotrophic factors, control over neurotransmitter synthesis, and preservation of the blood-brain barrier. Despite the encouraging outcomes, research is still being conducted to determine the optimal dosage and long-term benefits of vitamin D supplementation on brain function. In order to furnish precise directives and clarify the processes behind the neuroprotective impacts of vitamin D, future research must focus on large-scale randomized controlled studies. . This study highlights the significance of maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D as a modifiable risk factor for neurological disorders. Further study is also required to comprehend the possible medical benefits of this vitamin fully.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) affect millions and present significant challenges in healthcare and treatment costs. The debate in the field pivots around two hypotheses: synaptic spread and selective vulnerability. Pioneers like Virginia Lee and John Trojanowski have been instrumental in identifying key proteins (tau, alpha-synuclein, TDP-43) central to these diseases. The synaptic spread hypothesis suggests a cell-to-cell propagation of pathogenic proteins across neuronal synapses, influencing disease progression, with studies highlighting the role of proteins like alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta in this process. In contrast, the selective vulnerability hypothesis proposes inherent susceptibility of certain neurons to degeneration due to factors like metabolic stress, leading to protein aggregation. Recent advancements in neuroimaging, especially PET/MRI hybrid imaging, offer new insights into these mechanisms. While both hypotheses offer substantial evidence, their relative contributions to neurodegenerative processes remain to be fully elucidated. This uncertainty underscores the necessity for continued research, with a focus on these hypotheses, to develop effective treatments for these devastating diseases.",

    "abstract": "Barriers to communication and inaccurate provider assumptions about patient priorities limit the delivery of comprehensive, high-quality, patient-centered care (PCC) to people with Parkinson's (PWP). This study aimed to analyze priorities of PWP using a qualitative, unstructured single-question survey and to test associations with validated quality of life (QOL) measures.\nDuring appointments at a subspecialty, interdisciplinary clinic, PWP (n=139) provided written responses to the prompt: \"What is important for your care team to know about you?\" Patient Health Questionnaire, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Hoehn and Yahr scales were obtained through retrospective chart review. Key qualitative themes were identified through grounded theory analysis, and associations with quantitative health measures were tested with correlation analyses.\nCommon themes included participant health (eg, PD-related goals and comorbidities), non-illness identities (eg, family or community role), and the psychosocial impact of PD (eg, losing independence and uncertainty). Positive sentiments (n=73), such as motivation and optimism, were more common than negative sentiments (n=45), such as loss and fear. There was moderate concordance between worsened mental health and uncertainty (rho=0.206, p=0.02) and inverse concordance between worsened mobility and gratitude (rho=-0.174, p=0.04).\nThe range of priorities that PWP want to share with their care team is more diverse than that of common provider assumptions, is correlated with clinical outcomes such as mental health and mobility, and may not be captured by existing QOL assessment tools. An open-ended, qualitative prompt should be incorporated into routine specialist care for PWP as a valuable QOL indicator.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Nutritional alterations are one of the non-motor symptoms that most influence the quality of life (QoL) in PD.\nTherefore, this review aims to evaluate whether nutritional alterations are related either to the severity of motor and non-motor symptoms through the gut-brain axis or to the different treatments for PD and whether all of this, in turn, impacts the QoL of patients.\nA systematic review was carried out in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, and Mendeley from 2000 to June 2024, searching for articles related to nutritional alterations in PD that alter patients' QoL. A total of 14 articles (2,187 participants) of 924 records were included.\nAmong the 14 studies examined, two investigated the relationship between nutritional status and QoL in patients with PD. Poor nutritional status was associated with lower QoL scores. Four studies explored the connection between nutritional status and its impact on both motor and non-motor symptoms (psychiatric disturbances, cognitive impairment, and fatigue), revealing a link between nutritional status, activities of daily living, and the severity of motor symptoms. Three studies identified changes in body weight associated with the severity of symptoms related to mobility issues in PD patients. Three studies investigated the relationship between different PD treatments and their interaction with changes in weight and energy metabolism, highlighting that weight loss in the early stages of PD needs adequate monitoring of different treatments, as well as the interaction between the central and peripheral nervous systems in regulating these processes. Finally, two studies investigated how gastrointestinal alterations and changes in the microbiota were related to cognitive status, thus identifying them as risk factors and early signs of PD.\nThe systematic review highlighted the significant relationship between nutritional status and QoL in patients with PD, as well as how the PD treatments influenced their weight. An association was also observed in the gut-brain axis, where adequate nutritional status influenced the balance of intestinal microbiota, slowing cognitive decline, improving activities of daily living, and the QoL of PD patients. It is confirmed that the nutritional status of patients influenced both motor and non-motor symptoms of the disease, and therefore their QoL.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) is a genetic and neuropathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans suggested that variation of \u03b1S aggregation depends on the genetic background. However, which genes and genetic modifiers underlie individual differences in \u03b1S pathology remains unknown. To study the genotypic-phenotypic relationship of \u03b1S aggregation, we constructed a Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) panel derived from a cross between genetically divergent strains C. elegans NL5901 and SCH4856, both harboring the human \u03b1S gene. As a first step to discover genetic modifiers 70 \u03b1S-RILs were measured for whole-genome gene expression and expression quantitative locus analysis (eQTL) were mapped. We detected multiple eQTL hot-spots, many of which were located on Chromosome V. To confirm a causal locus, we developed Introgression Lines (ILs) that contain SCH4856 introgressions on Chromosome V in an NL5901 background. We detected 74 genes with an interactive effect between \u03b1S and the genetic background, including the human p38 MAPK homologue pmk-1 that has previously been associated with PD. Together, we present a unique \u03b1S-RIL panel for defining effects of natural genetic variation on \u03b1S pathology, which contributes to finding genetic modifiers of PD.",

    "abstract": "In this case series, results from daily visual exposure to intense polychromatic light of 2000 to 4000 LUX is presented. Bright light treatment is a standard procedure for treating seasonal affective disorder and prodromal Parkinson's disease with high success. With the post-encephalitic symptoms of long-COVID closely approximating those of prodromal Parkinson's disease, we treated insomnia and sleep-related parameters in these patients, including total sleep, number of awakenings, tendency to fall back to sleep, and fatigue, to determine whether mending sleep could improve quality of life.\nWe present three female and two male Caucasian patients aged 42-70\u00a0years with long-COVID\u00a0that persisted from 12 weeks to 139\u00a0weeks after contracting coronavirus disease.\nA light presentation protocol was adapted for long-COVID that not only restored sleep in all patients, but also unexpectedly repaired the depression, anxiety, and cognitive changes (brain fog) as well. A robust pattern of recovery commencing 4-5\u00a0days after treatment and\u00a0was maintained for weeks to months without relapse. These preliminary findings represent a novel, minimally invasive approach for managing the most debilitating symptoms of long-COVID, making it an ideal candidate for the drug hypersensitive, post-encephalitic brain. That a compromised circadian mechanism seen in Parkinson's disease may also underlie post-encephalitic long-COVID implicates a compromised role of the circadian system in these disorders.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in GBA1 encoding the lysosomal enzyme \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) are among the most prevalent genetic susceptibility factors for Parkinson's disease (PD), with 10-30% of carriers developing the disease. To identify genetic modifiers contributing to the incomplete penetrance, we examined the effect of 1634 human transcription factors (TFs) on GCase activity in lysates of an engineered human glioblastoma line homozygous for the pathogenic GBA1 L444P variant. Using an arrayed CRISPR activation library, we uncovered 11 TFs as regulators of GCase activity. Among these, activation of MITF and TFEC increased lysosomal GCase activity in live cells, while activation of ONECUT2 and USF2 decreased it. While MITF, TFEC, and USF2 affected GBA1 transcription, ONECUT2 might control GCase trafficking. The effects of MITF, TFEC, and USF2 on lysosomal GCase activity were reproducible in iPSC-derived neurons from PD patients. Our study provides a systematic approach to identifying modulators of GCase activity and deepens our understanding of the mechanisms regulating GCase.",

    "abstract": "Vocal impairments are early and debilitating symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Glottal insufficiency is a contributor to PD-related dysphonia. Vocal fold injection laryngoplasty (IL) and medialization thyroplasty (MT) are well-established techniques used to restore glottal closure for a range of causes. While use of these interventions to improve vocal function in people with Parkinson's disease (PWPD) has been described in literature, a scoping review of the nature, extent, and duration of benefits of procedural intervention to improve vocal fold closure is warranted to provide insight into patient candidacy for vocal fold medialization procedures in addition to standard PD-specific speech therapy protocols.\nScoping review.\nSeven biomedical databases and two gray literature resources were searched to retrieve English-language publications, without restrictions on publication type. Eligibility criteria were diagnosis of participants with PD in adults,\u00a0presence of a voice concern (eg, dysphonia or glottal insufficiency),\u00a0and intervention using IL or MT.\nThe search yielded 174 sources of evidence, 18 of which met inclusionary criteria. In total,\u00a013 publications were research studies,\u00a0three were reviews,\u00a0one was a conference proceeding,\u00a0and one was a book chapter. All available auditory-perceptual, quality of life, acoustic, endoscopic, and safety outcomes were tabulated for case studies and case reports. Studies revealed feasibility, and positive, yet varied, short-term outcomes of IL or MT. The quality of research articles was critically appraised using Joanna Briggs Institute checklists revealing trends of incomplete description of participant demographics,\u00a0nonconsecutive enrollment of participants,\u00a0absence of control participants,\u00a0and lack of validity of several outcome measures.\nFurther research, using a rigorous, controlled, blinded, prospective research design to reduce potential bias and improve generalizability of findings is warranted to clarify the benefit of IL and MT, with or without speech therapy, to improve vocal function for PWPD and guide patient selection for vocal fold medialization procedures.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter suis is the most common non-Helicobacter pylori gastric Helicobacter species found in humans. Infection is associated with gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric MALT lymphoma and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease. However, the pathogenicity of this species is still a matter of research, and results of virulence studies and antibiotic susceptibility tests tend to vary between strains. Cholesterol \u03b1-glucosyltransferase (\u03b1CgT), a known H. pylori virulence factor, appears to be present in most clinical H. suis isolates. The ability to form biofilms also plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of H. pylori. However, no reports have been published on this ability in H. suis. H. suis is considered an emerging zoonotic pathogen, with pigs being the main source of human infection. However, there is very little information on its presence in pork, mainly due to the difficulties of its culture. Therefore, our aim was to determine the prevalence of H. suis in pork products from our geographical area by PCR and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH), as well as to isolate the bacteria and determine the antibiotic susceptibility patterns, the presence of the \u03b1CgT gene and the ability of the isolates to form biofilms. Overall, H. suis was detected in 20 of the 70 (28.6\u00a0%) samples analyzed. In 3 of them, H. suis was isolated. The \u03b1CgT gene was detected in all isolates and two of them showed a multiresistance pattern. The H. suis reference strain and two of the isolates showed \"strong\" to \"moderate\" in vitro biofilm formation ability under optimal growth conditions. Our results seem to indicate that H. suis is significantly prevalent in pork products. The combination of culture with FISH and/or mPCR proved to be a rapid and specific method for the detection, identification and direct visualization of cultivable H. suis cells from pork food products.",

    "abstract": "Noise pollution pervades daily working and living environment, becoming a serious public health problem. In addition to causing auditory impairment, noise independently contributes to cognitive decline as a risk factor. Though neuroinflammation plays an important role in noise-induced cognitive deficits, the mechanisms underlying noise-induced neuroinflammation in the hippocampus are still poorly understood. Glial hyperactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, whether the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in noise-induced cognitive impairment remains to be further investigated.\nAdult male Wistar rats were exposed to 100\u202fdB white noise (4\u202fh/day) for 30 days with or without injection of the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 (10\u202fmg/kg/day). The Morris water maze (MWM) test and the open field test (OFT) were performed to evaluate learning and memory ability of rats. HE staining was used to explore hippocampal pathological changes, while immunohistochemical staining was employed to evaluate the number and morphology of microglia and astrocytes. The mRNA levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the hippocampus were examined by Real-time PCR. The protein levels of NLRP3 inflammasome, inflammatory cytokines, p-Tau-S396, and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) 42 in the hippocampus were examined by Western blot. Immunofluorescence was used to observe the distribution of NLRP3 in glial cells and neurons, and the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome.\nWe found that noise exposure induced learning and memory impairment in rats, mainly related to the activation of microglia and astrocytes in hippocampus region. Noise exposure increased the protein levels of p-Tau-S396, A\u03b242, ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in hippocampus. Furthermore, the hippocampus of noise-exposed rats showed elevated protein levels of NLRP3, ASC and cleaved caspase-1. The co-labeled immunofluorescence levels of Iba-1 or GFAP with NLRP3 significantly increased in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus. NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 intervention reversed chronic noise-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, AD-like pathologies and impairment of learning and memory in rats.\nThe NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation played an essential role in chronic noise-induced cognitive dysfunction. These results provide novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of cognitive deficits caused by chronic noise.",

Furthermore, the hippocampus of noise-exposed rats showed elevated protein levels of NLRP3, ASC and cleaved caspase-1. The co-labeled immunofluorescence levels of Iba-1 or GFAP with NLRP3 significantly increased in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus. NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 intervention reversed chronic noise-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, AD-like pathologies and impairment of learning and memory in rats.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are one of the most common non-motor symptoms in Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (IPD) patients. However, the effect of melatonin on sleep problems in Parkinson's disease patients is unclear.\nTo study the effect of melatonin on sleep in IPD patients through subjective and objective assessment.\nBetween August 2023 to February 2024, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on IPD patients. We randomized eligible subjects to melatonin (3\u00a0mg) (n\u00a0=\u00a043) or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a043) for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was sleep quality assessed through the Pittsburgh sleep quality index and daytime sleepiness using Epworth sleepiness scale. Secondary endpoints were polysomnographic sleep parameters, quality of life, motor and non-motor symptoms. Assessments were done at baseline and at the end of 8 weeks.\nWe screened 107 IPD patients and 86 patients were included in the study. Seventy three patients (melatonin, 35 and placebo, 38) completed the study. The mean change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score between the two groups was 1.87 (95\u00a0% CI: 1.5-2.1; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score was 1.25 (95\u00a0% CI: 0.80-1.71; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) favoring melatonin. The mean difference between the two groups for Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) was 6.11 (95\u00a0% CI 5.27-6.92; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ 39) 8.12 (95\u00a0% CI 6.97-9.50; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) & Polysomnography (PSG) parameters [sleep latency 8.36 (95\u00a0% CI 4.38-12.34; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and total sleep time 14.51 (95\u00a0% CI 5.00-24.41; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005)] favoring melatonin. Side effects attributable to melatonin were minimal.\nMelatonin is an effective and safe treatment option for sleep problems in PD patients, and beneficial effects on sleep quality are associated with improved non-motor symptoms and quality of life. We need to emphasize the fact that though we had statistically significant changes in our outcomes, it is not clear whether such changes would have real-life impact (meaningfulness) that would be relevant to licensing authorities or management as patients in our study are young, have short disease duration, have high use of anticholinergics and on modest levodopa equivalent dose. So, we are doubtful if this could be generalized to the typical PD population who are older, have longer disease duration and are on potentially sedating medications or not.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is reported to be among the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases globally, presenting ongoing challenges and increasing burden on health care systems. In an effort to support patients with PD, their carers, and the wider health care sector to manage this incurable condition, the focus has begun to shift away from traditional treatments. One of the most contemporary treatments includes prescribing assistive technologies (ATs), which are viewed as a way to promote independent living and deliver remote care. However, the uptake of these ATs is varied, with some users not ready or willing to accept all forms of AT and others only willing to adopt low-technology solutions. Consequently, to manage both the demands on resources and the efficiency with which ATs are deployed, new approaches are needed to automatically assess or predict a user's likelihood to accept and adopt a particular AT before it is prescribed. Classification algorithms can be used to automatically consider the range of factors impacting AT adoption likelihood, thereby potentially supporting more effective AT allocation. From a computational perspective, different classification algorithms and selection criteria offer various opportunities and challenges to address this need.\nThis paper presents a novel hybrid multicriteria decision-making approach to support classifier selection in technology adoption processes involving patients with PD.\nFirst, the intuitionistic fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (IF-AHP) was implemented to calculate the relative priorities of criteria and subcriteria considering experts' knowledge and uncertainty. Second, the intuitionistic fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (IF-DEMATEL) was applied to evaluate the cause-effect relationships among criteria/subcriteria. Finally, the combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) was used to rank the candidate classifiers based on their capability to model the technology adoption.\nWe conducted a study involving a mobile smartphone solution to validate the proposed methodology. Structure (F5) was identified as the factor with the highest relative priority (overall weight=0.214), while adaptability (F4) (D-R=1.234) was found to be the most influencing aspect when selecting classifiers for technology adoption in patients with PD. In this case, the most appropriate algorithm for supporting technology adoption in patients with PD was the A3 - J48 decision tree (M3=2.5592). The results obtained by comparing the CoCoSo method in the proposed approach with 2 alternative methods (simple additive weighting and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution) support the accuracy and applicability of the proposed methodology. It was observed that the final scores of the algorithms in each method were highly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient >0.8).\nThe IF-AHP-IF-DEMATEL-CoCoSo approach helped to identify classification algorithms that do not just discriminate between good and bad adopters of assistive technologies within the Parkinson population but also consider technology-specific features like design, quality, and compatibility that make these classifiers easily implementable by clinicians in the health care system.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are defined by specific protein accumulation and anatomic vulnerability leading to neuronal loss. Some studies have shown that lutein may have an effect on neurodegenerative diseases. As most of the neurodegenerative diseases don't have certain cure and therapies focus on symptom control, Lutein may be a complementary treatment. Due to controversies in studies investigating lutein effect on neurodegenerative diseases, we decided to perform a systematic review on these studies.\nA systematic search was carried out in the available databases. We used all MeSH terms and relevant keywords. Studies that reported relationship between lutein and any neurodegenerative disease were included.\nWe found 278 studies. After removing duplicates, screening by titles and abstracts and excluding irrelevant papers, 17 articles were included in this study. Fourteen studies investigated Alzheimer's disease, 2 studies Parkinson's disease and 1 study Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 1/17 study found that high serum levels of lutein at baseline were associated with a lower risk of AD mortality and lutein effect on lipid profile have been investigated in 2/17 studies. Also, 1/17 study has been shown that high intake of lutein may reduce the risk of ALS progression.\n4/17 studies confirm that lutein can improve cognitive function. 8/17 studies demonstrate a reduction in\u00a0the progression of AD, and 2/17 studies indicate an improvement in lipid profiles. However, some studies did not find any significant associations. Additionally, there is a limited number of studies investigating the effects of lutein on other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Directly assembling drugs into mesoporous nanoformulations will be greatly favored due to the combination of enhanced drug delivery efficiency and mesostructure-enabled nanobio interactions. However, such an approach is hindered due to the lack of understanding of polymer nanoparticles' formation mechanism, especially the relationship between polymerization, self-assembly, and the nucleation process. Here, by investigating the levodopa and dopamine polymerization process, we identify \u03c0-cation interaction as pivotal in the self-assembly and nucleation control of dopa molecules. Thus, through manipulation of the \u03c0-cation interaction, we present the direct assembly of a commercial drug, levodopa, into mesoporous nanoformulations. The synthesized nanospheres, approximately 200 nm in diameter, exhibit uniform mesopores of around 8 nm. These nanoformulations, abundant in mesopores, enhance chiral phenylalanine interaction with \u03b1-synuclein (Syn), curbing aggregation, safeguarding neurons, and alleviating Parkinson's pathology. When combating \u03b1-synuclein, the nanoformulation achieved \u223c100% inhibition of protein aggregation and sustained neuron viability up to 300%. We believe that this study may advance mesoscale self-assembly knowledge, guiding future nanopharmaceutical developments.",

    "abstract": "Sesquiterpenes are a class of organic compounds found in plants, fungi, and some insects. They are characterized by the presence of three isoprene units, resulting in a molecular formula that typically contains 15 carbon atoms (C\u2081\u2085H\u2082\u2084). Nerolidol and farnesol are both sesquiterpene alcohols present in the essential oils of numerous plants. They have drawn attention due to their potential neuroprotective properties. Nerolidol and farnesol are structural isomers, specifically geometric isomers, haring the same molecular formula (C\u2081\u2085H\u2082\u2084O) but differing in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. This variation in structure may contribute to their distinct biological activities. Scientific evidence suggests that nerolidol and farnesol exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics which are crucial for neuroprotection. Nerolidol has been specifically noted for its ability to alleviate conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, encephalomyelitis, depression, and anxiety by modulating inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Moreover, research indicates that both nerolidol and farnesol may modulate the Nrf-2/HO-1 antioxidant signaling pathway to mitigate oxidative stress-induced neurological damage. Activation of Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling cascade promotes cell survival and enhances the brain's ability to resist various insults. Nerolidol has also been reported to alleviate neuroinflammation by inhibiting the TLR-4/NF-\u03baB and COX-2/NF-\u03baB inflammatory signaling pathway. Besides, this nerolidol also modulates BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway to improve neuronal health. To date, limited research has delved into the anti-inflammatory properties of farnesol concerning neurodegenerative diseases. Further investigation is warranted to comprehensively elucidate the mechanisms underlying its action and potential therapeutic uses in neuroprotection. Initial observations indicate that farnesol exhibits promising prospects as a natural agent for safeguarding brain functions. Henceforth, drawing upon existing literature elucidating the neuroprotective attributes of nerolidol and farnesol, the current review endeavors to provide a detailed analysis of their mechanistic underpinnings in neuroprotection.",

    "abstract": "Upper extremity dysfunction is frequently seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). Existing research has shown that bradykinesia, which is main symptom of PD, is primarily responsible but the combined effects of spinal posture and axial rigidity on upper extremity functions were not investigated yet. The aim of this study was to investigate upper extremity functions in patients with PD and to evaluate relationship of these with spinal posture and axial rigidity.\nThis prospective controlled study included 40 patients with PD and 40 healthy controls. Upper extremity function was measured with the 9-Hole Peg Test. Spinal posture and axial rigidity were measured with a Spinal Mouse.\nCompared with the control group, a decrease in upper extremity functions (p\u2009<\u20090.001), decreased lumbar lordosis (p\u2009=\u20090.003), and posterior sacral tilt (p\u2009=\u20090.021) were determined in patients' group. Thoracic and lumbar mobility in the sagittal (all p\u2009<\u20090.001) and frontal planes (p\u2009=\u20090.004, p\u2009<\u20090.001) was found to be reduced in the patient group. A correlation was determined between upper extremity functions and lumbar mobility in the sagittal (p\u2009=\u20090.022, r= -0.362) and frontal planes (p\u2009=\u20090.045, r= -0.319) and lumbar lordosis (p\u2009=\u20090.048, r\u2009=\u20090.302).\nThe results of this study demonstrated that altered spinal posture and increased axial rigidity were related with decreased upper extremity functions in patients with PD. There is a need for further studies to investigate effect of trunk-based therapies on upper extremity function in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Nanoflowers, an innovative class of nanoparticles with a distinctive flower-like structure, have garnered significant interest for their straightforward synthesis, remarkable stability, and heightened efficiency. Nanoflowers demonstrate versatile applications, serving as highly sensitive biosensors for rapidly and accurately detecting conditions such as diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and foodborne infections. Nanoflowers, with their intricate structure, show significant potential for targeted drug delivery and site-specific action, while also exhibiting versatility in applications such as enzyme purification, water purification from dyes and heavy metals, and gas sensing through materials like nickel oxide. This review also addresses the structural characteristics, surface modification, and operational mechanisms of nanoflowers. The nanoflowers play a crucial role in preventing premature drug leakage from nanocarriers. Additionally, the nanoflowers contribute to averting systemic toxicity and suboptimal therapy efficiency caused by hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment during chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. This review entails the role of nanoflowers in cancer diagnosis and treatment. In the imminent future, the nanoflowers system is poised to revolutionize as a smart material, leveraging its exceptional surface-to-volume ratio to significantly augment adsorption efficiency across its intricate petals. This review delves into the merits and drawbacks of nanoflowers, exploring synthesis techniques, types, and their evolving applications in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the brain stem. PD is mostly sporadic, but familial PD (FPD) cases are recorded in different studies. The first gene mutation that is linked to FPD is \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn). It was then found that \u03b1-syn is also accumulated in Lewy body (LB), a classical pathological hallmark in PD patients. Different studies have shown that \u03b1-syn accumulation and aggregation can be a crucial factor contributing to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD. \u03b1-syn has been found to be degraded by the ubiquitin proteasomal system (UPS) and autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). In this study, we initially explored how \u03b1-syn phosphorylation by GRK6, PLK2 and CK2\u03b1 would facilitate its degradation in relation to the UPS or ALP. Unexpectedly, we found that the degradation of \u03b1-syn through PLK2 phosphorylation could be modulated by UPS and ALP in a novel mechanism. Specially, attenuation of UPS could increase the amount of PLK2 and then could facilitate the phosphorylation and degradation of \u03b1-syn through ALP. To test this further in\u00a0vivo, we attenuate the proteasomal activity in a well-established A53T \u03b1-syn transgenic PD mouse model. We found that attenuation of proteasomal activity in the A53T \u03b1-syn transgenic mice could reduce the accumulation of \u03b1-syn in the striatum and midbrain. Based on our results, this study provides a new insight into how \u03b1-syn is degraded through the UPS and ALP.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are multifactorial, chronic diseases involving neurodegeneration. According to recent studies, it is hypothesized that the intraneuronal and postsynaptic accumulation of misfolded proteins such as \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) and tau, responsible for Lewy bodies (LB) and tangles, respectively, disrupts neuron functions. Considering the co-occurrence of \u03b1-syn and tau inclusions in the brains of patients afflicted with subtypes of dementia and LB disorders, the discovery and development of small molecules for the inhibition of \u03b1-syn and tau aggregation can be a potentially effective strategy to delay neurodegeneration. Urea is a chaotropic agent that alters protein solubilization and hydrophobic interactions and inhibits protein aggregation and precipitation. The presence of three hetero atoms (O/S and N) in proximity can coordinate with neutral, mono, or dianionic groups to form stable complexes in the biological system. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated urea and thiourea linkers with various substitutions on either side of the carbamide or thiocarbamide functionality to compare the aggregation inhibition of \u03b1-syn and tau. A thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence assay was used to evaluate the level of fibril formation and monitor the anti-aggregation effect of the different compounds. We opted for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as a direct means to confirm the anti-fibrillar effect. The oligomer formation was monitored via the photoinduced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP). The anti-inclusion and anti-seeding activities of the best compounds were evaluated using M17D intracellular inclusion and biosensor cell-based assays, respectively. Disaggregation experiments were performed with amyloid plaques extracted from AD brains. The analogues with indole, benzothiazole, or ",

    "abstract": "S.\nTo study an influence of the adamantane derivative hemantane on the electrical activity of the brain structures of mice at the early and late (severe) stages of experimental modeling of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nFor experimental modeling of PD in C57BL/6J mice, 30 male C57BL/6J mice weighing 25-32 g were systemically (intraperitoneally) administered proneurotoxin MPTP in two modes corresponding to different clinical stages of the disease: 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1.2.3.6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) at a dose of 12 mg/kg, 4 times and 20 mg/kg, 4 times with an interval of 2 hours, respectively.\nAt the early and late clinical stages of experimental modeling of PD in the brain structures of mice (sensorimotor cortex, substantia nigra, caudate nucleus), EEG desynchronization, an increase in wave amplitude, and an increase in the power spectrum in the range of delta frequencies and beta frequencies are observed at the late symptomatic stage experimental model of PD along with a decrease in electrical activity in the range of 4-12 Hz. Preliminary application of the adamantane derivative hemantane at a dose of 20 mg/kg, both in the early and late clinical stages of PD, prevented an excessive increase in the amplitudes of all groups of waves, normalized theta activity in the range of 4-12 Hz, reduced pathological slowing and dysregulation activity in the ranges delta and beta waves, with the prevalence of these effects in the substantia nigra of the brain of animals.\nThe effect of hemantane is more pronounced at the early clinical stage of experimental modeling of PD than at the later (full-scale) stage.\n\u0418\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e

Preliminary application of the adamantane derivative hemantane at a dose of 20 mg/kg, both in the early and late clinical stages of PD, prevented an excessive increase in the amplitudes of all groups of waves, normalized theta activity in the range of 4-12 Hz, reduced pathological slowing and dysregulation activity in the ranges delta and beta waves, with the prevalence of these effects in the substantia nigra of the brain of animals.",

    "abstract": "To study the prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and association of CFS with other clinical and neuropsychological manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as with serum inflammatory markers and genetic polymorphisms.\nThe study included 533 patients with PD. All patients underwent clinical, neurological examination and neuropsychological testing using validated questionnaires: MoCA test, HADS, BDI-II, the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Serum concentrations of inflammatory markers (slCAM-1, sVCAM-1, NCAM, CCL5, PAI-1 and MPO) were assessed in 144 patients using xMAP technology. A case-control study of \nCFS is common in 66.7% of patients in the PD group. In addition, non-motor symptoms (emotional-affective, cognitive, autonomic disorders and pain) were more common in patients with CFS. A strong correlation has been established between the severity of CFS assessed with FSS and serum concentrations of CCL5, sVCAM-1, NCAM and slCAM-1. In newly diagnosed patients with PD who were not taking antiparkinsonian drugs at the time of the study and had CFS, higher correlations were noted between inflammatory markers and the severity of CFS manifestations. When comparing the distribution of genotypes and alleles of CCL5 (rs2107538) and PAI-1 (rs2227631) polymorphisms, some differences were found between the groups of patients with PD and controls (\nCFS is common in PD, and patients with PD and CFS are characterized by elevated levels of serum markers CCL5, sVCAM-1, slCAM-1 and NCAM, suggesting the importance of the inflammatory component in the development of neurodegenerative disease. In addition, the clinical course of PD in patients with CFS is aggravated by other non-motor manifestations, including emotional-affective, cognitive, autonomic disorders and pain. These results highlight the potential contribution of an inflammatory component to the development of fatigue associated with PD, starting from the earliest clinical stages of the disease.\n\u0418\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438

In addition, the clinical course of PD in patients with CFS is aggravated by other non-motor manifestations, including emotional-affective, cognitive, autonomic disorders and pain. These results highlight the potential contribution of an inflammatory component to the development of fatigue associated with PD, starting from the earliest clinical stages of the disease.",

    "results": "CFS is common in 66.7% of patients in the PD group. In addition, non-motor symptoms (emotional-affective, cognitive, autonomic disorders and pain) were more common in patients with CFS. A strong correlation has been established between the severity of CFS assessed with FSS and serum concentrations of CCL5, sVCAM-1, NCAM and slCAM-1. In newly diagnosed patients with PD who were not taking antiparkinsonian drugs at the time of the study and had CFS, higher correlations were noted between inflammatory markers and the severity of CFS manifestations. When comparing the distribution of genotypes and alleles of CCL5 (rs2107538) and PAI-1 (rs2227631) polymorphisms, some differences were found between the groups of patients with PD and controls (",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a progressive generalized skeletal muscle disease that is accompanied by an accelerated loss of muscle mass and function, affecting the quality of life and the ability to perform self-care. The prevalence of sarcopenia in the world today ranges from 10 to 25%, which represents a certain danger as it is a prognostic factor for possible injury and increased disability in the elderly population. Sarcopenia often accompanies a large number of different diseases, including neurodegenerative ones, so it is actively studied in this category of patients, for example, as one of the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). PD and sarcopenia have overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms of muscle fiber loss: inflammation, muscle autophagy, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Loss of muscle mass due to malnutrition is common in PD. According to some studies, the prevalence of sarcopenia in PD varies from 6 to 55.8%; weakness and sarcopenia are more common in patients with PD than in society as a whole, which is associated with an unfavorable course of the disease. The presence of both diseases simultaneously in one patient can impose certain restrictions on the treatment of the patient, worsen his physical and mental condition, which determines the need for early detection of sarcopenia in patients with PD.\n\u0421\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u2014 \u044d\u0442\u043e

    "abstract": "Recent advances in research on extracellular vesicles have significantly enhanced their potential as therapeutic agents for neurological diseases. Owing to their therapeutic properties and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, extracellular vesicles are recognized as promising drug delivery vehicles for various neurological conditions, including ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases, glioma, and psychosis.However, the clinical application of natural extracellular vesicles is hindered by their limited targeting ability and short clearance from the body. To address these limitations, multiple engineering strategies have been developed to enhance the targeting capabilities of extracellular vesicles, thereby enabling the delivery of therapeutic contents to specific tissues or cells. Therefore, this review aims to highlight the latest advancements in natural and targeting-engineered extracellular vesicles, exploring their applications in treating traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, glioma, and psychosis. Additionally, we summarized recent clinical trials involving extracellular vesicles and discussed the challenges and future prospects of using targeting-engineered extracellular vesicles for drug delivery in treating neurological diseases. This review offers new insights for developing highly targeted therapies in this field.",

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration Is a serious neurodegenerativo disease of the retina that significantly impacts vision. Unfortunately, the specific pathogenesis remains unclear, and effective early treatment options are consequently lacking. The microbiome is defined as a large ecosystem of microorganisms living within and coexisting with a host. The intestinal microbiome undergoes dynamic changes owing to age, diet, genetics, and other factors. Such dysregulation of the intestinal flora can disrupt the microecological balance, resulting in immunological and metabolic dysfunction in the host, and affecting the development of many diseases. In recent decades, significant evidence has indicated that the intestinal flora also influences systems outside of the digestive tract, including the brain. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated the critical role of the gut-brain axis in the development of brain neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Similarly, the role of the \"gut-eye axis\" has been confirmed to play a role in the pathogenesis of many ocular disorders. Moreover, age-related macular degeneration and many brain neurodegenerative diseases have been shown to share several risk factors and to exhibit comparable etiologies. As such, the intestinal flora may play an important role in age-related macular degeneration. Given the above context, the present review aims to clarify the gut-brain and gut-eye connections, assess the effect of intestinal flora and metabolites on age-related macular degeneration, and identify potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies. Currently, direct research on the role of intestinal flora in age-related macular degeneration is still relatively limited, while studies focusing solely on intestinal flora are insufficient to fully elucidate its functional role in age-related macular degeneration. Organ-on-a-chip technology has shown promise in clarifying the gut-eye interactions, while integrating analysis of the intestinal flora with research on metabolites through metabolomics and other techniques is crucial for understanding their potential mechanisms.",

Recent findings suggest that microglia dysfunction could contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Microglia may worsen the neuronal microenvironment by persistent inflammation, resulting in deficient clearing of aggregated \u03b1Syn. To model microglial behavior in PD, we utilized human induced pluripotent stem cells to generate functionally active microglia. We studied the microglial uptake of alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFFs) and the effect of pro-inflammatory stimulation by interferon gamma. We demonstrate that combined exposure disrupts the phagosome maturation pathway while inflammatory stimuli suppress chaperone mediated autophagy and mitochondrial function. Furthermore, inflammatory stimulation impairs PFF uptake in microglia and increases cytokine production. Moreover, excessive PFF uptake by microglia results in induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Taken together, we demonstrate that this model is valuable for investigating the behavior of microglia in PD and provide new insights on how human microglia process aggregated \u03b1Syn.",

    "abstract": "Gait disorder is a prominent motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), objective and quantitative assessment of gait is essential for diagnosing and treating PD, particularly in its early stage.\nThis study utilized a non-contact gait assessment system to investigate gait characteristics between individuals with PD and healthy controls, with a focus on early-stage PD. Additionally, we trained two machine learning models to differentiate early-stage PD patients from controls and to predict MDS-UPDRS III score.\nEarly-stage PD patients demonstrated reduced stride length, decreased gait speed, slower stride and swing speeds, extended turning time, and reduced cadence compared to controls. Our model, after an integrated analysis of gait parameters, accurately identified early-stage PD patients. Moreover, the model indicated that gait parameters could predict the MDS-UPDRS III score using a machine learning regression approach.\nThe non-contact gait assessment system facilitates the objective and quantitative evaluation of gait disorder in PD patients, effectively distinguishing those in the early stage from healthy individuals. The system holds significant potential for the early detection of PD. It also harnesses gait parameters for a reasoned prediction of the MDS-UPDRS III score, thereby quantifying disease severity. Overall, gait assessment is a valuable method for the early identification and ongoing monitoring of PD.",

    "abstract": "Evidence from a number of paradigms suggests that methamphetamine use is associated with increased risk for the development of Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism, and that it may be associated with the premature development of Parkinson's disease. Prevalence of Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism is greater in both methamphetamine users and people who previously used methamphetamine, and evidence from animal studies provides a plausible mechanism for this observation. Despite this increased risk, Parkinson's disease is rarely diagnosed in methamphetamine users. Reasons for this may include under-detection, premature mortality, and individual and substance use characteristics which moderate the risk, including higher rates of smoking. Clinicians should be vigilant to signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism in methamphetamine users.",

    "abstract": "Determining the genetic contributions to Parkinson's disease (PD) across diverse ancestries is a high priority as this work can guide therapeutic development in a global setting. The genetics of PD spans the etiological risk spectrum, from rare, highly deleterious variants linked to monogenic forms with Mendelian patterns of inheritance, to common variation involved in sporadic disease. A major limitation in PD genomics research is lack of racial and ethnic diversity. Enrollment disparities have detrimental consequences on the generalizability of results and exacerbate existing inequities in care. The Black and African American Connections to Parkinson's Disease (BLAAC PD) study is part of the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program, supported by the Aligning Science Across Parkinson's initiative. The goal of the study is to investigate the genetic architecture underlying PD risk and progression in the Black and/or African American populations. This cross-sectional multicenter study in the United States has a recruitment target of up to 2,000 individuals with PD and up to 2,000 controls, all of Black and/or African American ancestry. The study design incorporates several strategies to reduce barriers to research participation. The multifaceted recruitment strategy aims to involve individuals with and without PD in various settings, emphasizing community outreach and engagement. The BLAAC PD study is an important first step toward informing understanding of the genetics of PD in a more diverse population.",

    "abstract": "Subcortical brain structures are involved in developmental, psychiatric and neurological disorders. Here we performed genome-wide association studies meta-analyses of intracranial and nine subcortical brain volumes (brainstem, caudate nucleus, putamen, hippocampus, globus pallidus, thalamus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala and the ventral diencephalon) in 74,898 participants of European ancestry. We identified 254 independent loci associated with these brain volumes, explaining up to 35% of phenotypic variance. We observed gene expression in specific neural cell types across differentiation time points, including genes involved in intracellular signaling and brain aging-related processes. Polygenic scores for brain volumes showed predictive ability when applied to individuals of diverse ancestries. We observed causal genetic effects of brain volumes with Parkinson's disease and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Findings implicate specific gene expression patterns in brain development and genetic variants in comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders, which could point to a brain substrate and region of action for risk genes implicated in brain diseases.",

    "abstract": "To examine the association and modifiable risk factors between grip strength (GS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) incidence considering genetic factors, a total of 411,648 individuals without PD at baseline from the UK Biobank were included. GS was measured by a hydraulic dynamometer. The polygenic risk score assessed the genetic predisposition. Multivariable Cox regression models were performed. During a median follow-up of 12.3 years, 2409 individuals developed PD. Compared with those with high GS, low-GS individuals had a 58.5% increased risk of PD (42.7%-76.1%), and 16.3% of this excess risk could be explained by adjusted risk factors. Low GS and high genetic predisposition contribute to the highest PD risk in an additive interaction. We observed that low GS was associated with higher PD incidence, particularly among individuals with high genetic predisposition. In addition to enhancing GS, interventions targeting risk factors (e.g., unhealthy lifestyles) might also reduce the excess risk.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), essential tremors, dystonia, and treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of DBS on Body Mass Index (BMI). Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, data from 49 studies were reviewed, with 46 studies specifically focusing on BMI and DBS. These studies involved 1,478 participants, predominantly PD patients, with an average age of 58.82\u00a0years. The primary DBS implantation site was the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Over six months, the mean BMI increased from 25.69 to 27.41, despite a reduction in daily energy intake from 1992 to 1873\u00a0kJ. While the findings suggest a correlation between DBS and weight gain, the study has limitations. The sample largely comprised PD patients (91%), preventing analysis of other subtypes. Additionally, most studies focused on the STN, limiting comparisons with other targets like the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Inconsistencies in assessing daily energy intake and food consumption further complicate the results. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in future research could address these gaps. For example, machine learning algorithms, such as those used by Oliveira et al., can predict post-DBS weight changes based on pre-surgical BMI and demographic factors. Similarly, AI-driven models like CLOVER-DBS can optimize DBS settings for improved motor control in PD patients. In conclusion, DBS affects BMI, and AI has the potential to enhance the precision of future studies.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy effectively treats medication-resistant essential tremor (ET). Usually, intracranial calcifications are excluded as no-pass zones because of their low penetrability which may limit the effectiveness of treatment and lead to unintended side effects. This case report illustrates the efficacy of unilateral MRgFUS for tremor control in a patient with extensive basal ganglia calcifications due to Fahr's disease.\nA 69-year-old right-handed male with debilitating Fahn-Tolosa-Marin grade 3-4 bilateral hand tremor underwent unilateral left MRgFUS thalamotomy. The treatment involved careful preoperative planning to accommodate his extensive basal ganglia calcifications, element path consideration, and skull density ratio to ensure accurate and effective lesioning. Posttreatment, the patient exhibited complete abolition of tremor on the treated side with minor transient dysarthria and imbalance. Follow-up at 12 weeks posttreatment showed sustained tremor relief and an absence of any adverse effects, validating the procedural adjustments made to accommodate the unique challenges posed by his intracranial calcifications.\nMRgFUS can be safely and effectively applied in certain patients with extensive basal ganglia calcifications - in this case, due to Fahr's disease. This case report suggests expanding the application of MRgFUS to patients with extensive intracranial calcifications who previously might not have been considered suitable candidates for MRgFUS.",

    "abstract": "Given that patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Freezing of Gait (FoG) may lack the cognitive resources necessary to activate the motor imagery (MI) process, investigating how to boost MI vividness and accuracy could be a valuable therapeutic strategy in MI Practice (MIP).\nWe aim to evaluate the priming effect of visual, or auditory, or attentional stimuli in enhancing MI ability by using quantitative data on gait and turning performance.\nNineteen PD participants with FoG underwent four one-week sessions of MIP, with pre and post clinical assessments. Each session included MI alone or one of three booster MI tasks (Attentional, Action observation, or Auditory) before imagining and executing walking straight and performing a 180\u00b0 turn. Gait and turning performances were evaluated using six inertial sensors before and after each session.\nOur findings showed that both MI and boosted MI induced similar improvement in gait (speed and stride length) and 180\u00b0 (step number and velocity) and 360\u00b0 turning (velocity, angle) parameters compared to baseline. When differences among \"booster\" tasks were analyzed, results showed that Auditory and Attentional boosted MI were superior to MI alone in some gait and turning parameters. At the end of the 4 sessions, MI ability measured by means of Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire and Gait Imagery Questionnaire and FoG symptoms were also improved.\nOur preliminary results suggest that boosting MI is a feasible strategy for enhancing MI ability and addressing FoG symptoms. Auditory and Attentional conditions appear to enhance the priming effect of MI on gait and turning performance more effectively.",

    "abstract": "Augmented-reality (AR) applications have shown potential for assisting and modulating gait in health-related fields, like AR cueing of foot-placement locations in people with Parkinson's disease. However, the size of the AR field of view (AR-FOV), which is smaller than one's own FOV, might affect interaction with nearby floor-based holographic objects. The study's primary objective was to evaluate the effect of AR-FOV size on the required head orientations for viewing and interacting with real-world and holographic floor-based objects during standstill and walking conditions. Secondary, we evaluated the effect of AR-FOV size on gait speed when interacting with real-world and holographic objects. Sixteen healthy middle-aged adults participated in two experiments wearing HoloLens 1 and 2 AR headsets that differ in AR-FOV size. To confirm participants' perceived differences in AR-FOV size, we examined the head orientations required for viewing nearby and far objects from a standstill position (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, we examined the effect of AR-FOV size on head orientations and gait speeds for negotiating 2D and 3D objects during walking. Less downward head orientation was required for looking at nearby holographic objects with HoloLens 2 than with HoloLens 1, as expected given differences in perceived AR-FOV size (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, a greater downward head orientation was observed for interacting with holographic objects compared to real-world objects, but again less so for HoloLens 2 than HoloLens 1 along the line of progression. Participants walked slightly but significantly slower when interacting with holographic objects compared to real-world objects, without any differences between the HoloLenses. To conclude, the increased size of the AR-FOV did not affect gait speed, but resulted in more real-world-like head orientations for seeing and picking up task-relevant information when interacting with floor-based holographic objects, improving the potential efficacy of AR cueing applications.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common and disabling in Parkinson's disease (PD), with troublesome anxiety occurring in one-third of patients. Management of anxiety in PD is challenging, hampered by insufficient insight into underlying mechanisms, lack of objective anxiety measurements, and largely ineffective treatments. In this study, we assessed the intracranial neurophysiological correlates of anxiety in PD patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the laboratory and at home. We hypothesized that low-frequency (theta-alpha) activity would be associated with anxiety. We recorded local field potentials (LFP) from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) DBS implants in three PD cohorts: 1) patients with recordings (STN) performed in hospital at rest via perioperatively externalized leads, without active stimulation, both ON or OFF dopaminergic medication; 2) patients with recordings (STN or GPi) performed at home while resting, via a chronically implanted commercially available sensing-enabled neurostimulator (Medtronic PerceptTM device), ON dopaminergic medication, with stimulation both on or off; 3) patients with recordings performed at home while engaging in a behavioral task via STN and GPi leads and electrocorticography paddles over premotor cortex connected to an investigational sensing-enabled neurostimulator, ON dopaminergic medication, with stimulation both on or off. Trait anxiety was measured with validated clinical scales in all participants, and state anxiety was measured with momentary assessment scales at multiple time points in the two at-home cohorts. Power in theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) ranges were extracted from the LFP recordings, and their relation with anxiety ratings was assessed using linear mixed-effects models. In total, 33 PD patients (59 hemispheres) were included. Across three independent cohorts, with stimulation off, basal ganglia theta power was positively related to trait anxiety (all p<0.05). Also in a naturalistic setting, with individuals at home at rest with stimulation and medication ON, basal ganglia theta power was positively related to trait anxiety (p<0.05). This relationship held regardless of the hemisphere and DBS target. There was no correlation between trait anxiety and premotor cortical theta-alpha power. There was no within-patient association between basal ganglia theta-alpha power and state anxiety. We showed that basal ganglia theta activity indexes trait anxiety in PD. Our data suggest that theta could be a possible physiomarker of neuropsychiatric symptoms and specifically of anxiety in PD, potentially suitable for guiding advanced DBS treatment tailored to the individual patient's needs, including non-motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) is a significant global health issue due to its high incidence, drug resistance, contagious nature, and impact on people with compromised immune systems. As mentioned by the World Health Organization (WHO), TB is responsible for more global fatalities than any other infectious illness. On the other side, WHO also claims that noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) kill 41 million people yearly worldwide. In this regard, several studies suggest that PTB and NCDs are linked in various ways and that people with PTB are more likely to acquire NCDs. At the same time, NCDs can increase susceptibility to active TB infection. Furthermore, because of potential drug interactions and therapeutic challenges, treating individuals with both PTB and NCDs can be difficult. This study focuses on seven NCDs (lung cancer (LC), diabetes mellitus (DM), Parkinson's disease (PD), silicosis (SI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)) and rigorously presents the genetic relationship with PTB regarding shared genes and outlines possible treatment plans.\nBlueThis study aims to identify the drug components that can regulate abnormal gene expression in NCDs. The study will reveal hub genes, potential biomarkers, and drug components associated with hub genes through statistical measures. This will contribute to targeted therapeutic interventions.\nNumerous investigations, including protein-protein interaction (PPI), gene regulatory network (GRN), enrichment analysis, physical interaction, and protein-chemical interaction, have been carried out to demonstrate the genetic correlation between PTB and NCDs. During the study, nine shared genes such as TNF, IL10, NLRP3, IL18, IFNG, HMGB1, CXCL8, IL17A, and NFKB1 were discovered between TB and the above-mentioned NCDs, and five hub genes (NFKB1, TNF, CXCL8, NLRP3, and IL10) were selected based on degree values.\nIn this study, we found that all of the hub genes are linked with the 10 drug components, and it was observed that aspirin CTD 00005447 was mostly associated with all the other hub genes. This bio-informatics study may help researchers better understand the cause of PTB and its relationship with NCDs, and eventually, this can lead to exploring effective treatment plans.",

    "abstract": "With global increase in ageing population along with increasing age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), development of sustainable, safe and effective solutions for promoting healthy ageing and preventing diseases has become a priority. Traditional healthcare systems/medicines prescribe several herbs, foods and formulations to promote healthy ageing and prevent and/or treat age-related diseases. However, the scientific data elucidating their mechanism of action is very limited and deeper research using different models is warranted for timely and wider use. The clinical studies and research with higher model organisms, although useful, have several practical, technical, and financial limitations. Conversely, small organism models like Yeast, Roundworm, Fruit fly, and Zebrafish, which have genetic similarities to humans, can replicate the disease features and provide behavioural, cellular and molecular insights. The common features of ageing and NDs, like amyloid protein aggregations, oxidative stress, energy dysregulation, inflammation and neurodegeneration can be mimicked in the small organism models for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's diseases, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. This review focuses on small organism model- based research unveiling interesting modes of action and synergistic effects of herbal extracts, foods, and formulations, which are indicated especially for healthy ageing and management of NDs. This will provide leads for the quick and sustainable development of scientifically evaluated solutions for clinically relevant, age-related conditions.",

    "abstract": "The risk of developing Parkinson disease (PD) after objective hearing loss is unknown. PD studies using self-reported hearing loss are insensitive, and objective data are lacking.\nTo examine the association of hearing loss with incident PD in US veterans and its effect modification by well-established prodromal conditions and hearing aids.\nThis cohort study analyzed electronic health record data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans who had an audiogram from January 1, 1999, to December 30, 2022. Individuals with data missing or a preexisting PD diagnosis were excluded.\nAudiogram-confirmed hearing loss.\nCumulative incidence of PD was calculated with adjustment for competing risk of death.\nAmong 7\u202f296\u202f051 veterans with an audiogram, 3\u202f596\u202f365 were included. They were mostly male (n\u2009=\u20093\u202f452\u202f898 [96%]) and had a mean (SD) age of 67 (10.3) years. A total of 750\u202f010 individuals (20.8%) had normal hearing at the time of audiometry examination; among those with hearing loss, 1\u202f080\u202f651 (30.0%), 1\u202f039\u202f785 (28.9%), 568\u202f296 (15.8%), and 157\u202f623 (4.3%) individuals had mild (20-<35 dB), moderate (35-<50 dB), moderate to severe (50-<65 dB), and severe to profound (65-120 dB) hearing loss, respectively. Age, gender, and smoking history were balanced between all exposed and unexposed groups with further adjustment for race, ethnicity, and frailty. At 10 years after the baseline audiogram, the numbers of additional cases of PD were 6.1 (95% CI, 4.5-7.79, 15.8 (95% CI, 12.8-18.8), 16.2 (95% CI, 11.9-20.6), and 12.1 (95% CI, 4.5-19.6) among veterans with mild, moderate, moderate to severe, and severe to profound hearing loss, respectively, compared with those with normal hearing. When combined with established prodromal conditions, hearing loss was associated with 5.7 (95% CI, 2.2-9.2) additional cases of PD at 10 years compared with either condition alone. With prompt hearing aid dispensation, incident cases of PD decreased by 21.6 cases (95% CI, 19.5-23.6) at 10 years.\nHearing loss appears to be an independent risk factor for later development of PD. Hearing aids attenuate this risk, and therefore widespread screening for hearing loss and appropriate use of hearing aids may reduce the incidence of PD. Additional studies are needed to examine the mechanisms underlying the association between hearing loss and PD.",

A total of 750\u202f010 individuals (20.8%) had normal hearing at the time of audiometry examination; among those with hearing loss, 1\u202f080\u202f651 (30.0%), 1\u202f039\u202f785 (28.9%), 568\u202f296 (15.8%), and 157\u202f623 (4.3%) individuals had mild (20-<35 dB), moderate (35-<50 dB), moderate to severe (50-<65 dB), and severe to profound (65-120 dB) hearing loss, respectively. Age, gender, and smoking history were balanced between all exposed and unexposed groups with further adjustment for race, ethnicity, and frailty. At 10 years after the baseline audiogram, the numbers of additional cases of PD were 6.1 (95% CI, 4.5-7.79, 15.8 (95% CI, 12.8-18.8), 16.2 (95% CI, 11.9-20.6), and 12.1 (95% CI, 4.5-19.6) among veterans with mild, moderate, moderate to severe, and severe to profound hearing loss, respectively, compared with those with normal hearing. When combined with established prodromal conditions, hearing loss was associated with 5.7 (95% CI, 2.2-9.2) additional cases of PD at 10 years compared with either condition alone. With prompt hearing aid dispensation, incident cases of PD decreased by 21.6 cases (95% CI, 19.5-23.6) at 10 years.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, but dopamine also plays a role in the pathophysiology of migraine.\nThe aim of this study is to assess lifetime and previous year prevalence rates of headache in PD patients compared with controls.\nWe enrolled 101 patients (57\u00a0M and 44\u00a0W) and 101 controls (62\u00a0M and 39\u00a0W), comparable for age and gender, who underwent a semi-structured questionnaire to assess the occurrence and the features of headache, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).\nWe did not find any significant differences in the overall prevalence of lifetime and last 12-month headache between the two groups, as well as lifetime and last year tension-type headache (TTH) and migraine. Patients, especially those suffering from migraine and treated with dopamine agonists (DA), more frequently showed headache remission after the onset of motor symptoms compared to the age-related remission observed in controls\u00a0(p\u2009=\u20090.001). Patients affected by headache were less frequently treated with DA in comparison with those without (p\u2009=\u20090.051). Depression of mood was more severe among PD patients with migraine than with TTH (p\u2009=\u20090.021). PD patients with headache exhibiting the akinetic-rigid subtype more frequently reported motor fluctuations than those presenting with tremor-dominant disease (p\u2009=\u20090.040).\nThe prevalence of headache in PD follows that described in the general population, but dopaminergic pathway degeneration, loss of dopamine activation on the trigeminal-vascular system, and DA treatment might favor migraine improvement and remission in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Patients with severe COVID-19 may be more likely to develop PD as a result of shared biological pathways including a great expansion of MDSCs and an imbalance in Th17/Tregs ratio. We think that these shared pathogenic features may mechanistically explain the COVID-19 - PD axis. Thus, we assume that patients who recovered from critical COVID-19 should be selected based upon a potential higher risk of developing PD. Further studies are needed to better define the possible relationship between COVID-19 and neuroinflammation and identify whether some people are more likely to develop PD after contracting COVID-19 than others with special emphasis to ascertain possible vulnerable genetic backgrounds or epigenetic factors acting on brain which may promote PD during SARS COV-2 infection. Finally, we think that regular physical activity should be performed and encouraged in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) relies on accurate lead placement as well as optimization of the stimulation parameters. Although clinical software tools are now available, programming still largely relies on a monopolar review, a tedious process for both patients and programmers.\nThis study investigates the safety and feasibility of prospective automated connectomic DBS programming (automated connectomic programming [ACP]), focusing on the recruitment of specific white matter pathways.\nAfter DBS implantation, a detailed connectomic DBS model in patient-specific space was developed for each study participant. A driving-force model was used to quantify pathway recruitment across 2400 different DBS settings. Optimization algorithms maximized recruitment of therapeutic pathways while minimizing recruitment of side-effect pathways. Thirteen subjects were enrolled in two study phases that compared DBS settings derived from ACP to standard clinical DBS settings.\nNine patients underwent reprogramming with ACP (5 globus pallidus interna [GPi], 4 subthalamic nucleus [STN]). Four patients underwent initial programming with ACP (3 GPi, 1 STN). All patients tolerated ACP without persistent side effects. In the reprogramming cohort, 3 patients preferred their ACP program, and 1 patient felt it was comparable to their clinical program. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part III, scores for the initial ACP cohort (3 GPi, 1 STN) improved by an average of 43.5% (40.4-52.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.6%).\nACP appeared clinically safe and feasible. It provided reasonable motor improvement, which can be further optimized with subsequent clinical adjustment. Additional investigation is required to refine the optimization algorithm and to quantify the clinical benefit of ACP in a larger cohort. \u00a9 2024 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety is a prominent non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). Changes in the B-spectrum recordings in PD patients of the prefrontal cortex correlate with increased anxiety. Using a rodent model of PD, we reported alterations in glutamate synapses in the striatum and substantia nigra following dopamine (DA) loss. We hypothesize that DA loss will result in increased anxiety-related behaviours and that this will be associated with alterations in glutamate synapses and transporters within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Following 4\u00a0weeks of progressive 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) administration, there was an increase in anxiety-related behaviours and a 78% decrease in plasma corticosterone levels versus the vehicle (VEH)-treated mice. This was associated with a 30% decrease in the density of dendritic spines in Layers Il/Ill, and a 53% decrease in the density of glutamate immuno-gold labelling within vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (Vglut1)-labelled nerve terminals and spines, with no change within vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) positive terminals/spines in the MPTP versus VEH groups. Our prior work determined that a decrease in striatal glutamate terminal density was associated with an increase in extracellular glutamate levels. There was an increase in protein expression of Vglut1 (40%), Vglut2 (37%) and glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) (225%), and a decrease in glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) (50%) and excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) (51%), in the MPTP versus VEH groups within the mPFC. These data suggest that the decrease in dendritic spines within the mPFC following nigrostriatal DA loss may be due to increased extracellular glutamate levels (decrease in glutamate transporters), leading to an increase in anxiety-related behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopamine (DA) neuron loss and neuroinflammation. This study develops carrier-free nanocapsules (NCs) for targeted delivery of DA and catalase (CAT) to the PD brain, addressing both DA depletion and neuroinflammation simultaneously. The NCs are engineered by DA and 4-formylphenylboronic acid co-loading with cRGD-modified CAT (CAT-cRGD) and surface-modifying with Angiopep-2 (Ang). Ang targets the blood-brain barrier (BBB), enhancing brain delivery, while cRGD targets upregulated integrin receptors in the PD-affected BBB. The NCs showed a 1.4-fold increase in parkinsonian brain targeting efficiency compared to normal mice. In PD mice models, NCs demonstrated a stable increase in learning and memory, enhanced locomotor activity, and improved motor coordination. DA supplementation significantly enhanced dopaminergic signaling, increasing DA levels 1.8- and 3.5-fold in the striatum and substantia nigra, respectively. Additionally, delivered CAT effectively reduced neuroinflammation by mitigating endoplasmic reticulum stress, slowing disease progression, and protecting DA from oxidation. This innovative approach using PD-targeted NCs represents a synergistic strategy for PD treatment, combining symptomatic relief with disease progression intervention.",

    "abstract": "The study of the brain-gut axis and its impact on cognitive function and in the development of neurodegenerative diseases is a very timely topic of interest to researchers. This review summarizes information on the basic mechanisms of gut-brain communication. We then discuss the roles of the gut microbiome as a neuroprotective factor in neurodegeneration. The gut microbiota is extremely important in maintaining the body's homeostasis, shaping the human immune system and the proper functioning of the brain. The intestinal microflora affects the processes of neuroplasticity, synaptogenesis, and neuronal regeneration. This review aims to explain changes in the composition of the bacterial population of the intestinal microflora among patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Abnormalities in gut microflora composition are also noted in stress, depression, or autism spectrum development. New observations on psychobiotic supplementation in alleviating the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases are also presented.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the pathological accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein, which has driven extensive research into the role of exosomes in disease mechanisms. Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles enriched with proteins, RNA, and lipids that facilitate critical intercellular communication processes. Recent studies have elucidated the role of exosomes in transmitting misfolded proteins among neurons, which significantly impacts the progression of PD. The presence of disease-associated exosomes in cerebrospinal fluid and blood highlights their substantial diagnostic potential for PD. Specifically, exosomes derived from the central nervous system (CNS) have emerged as promising biomarkers because of their ability to accurately reflect pathological states. Furthermore, the isolation of exosomes from distinct brain cell types allows the identification of precise biomarkers, increasing diagnostic specificity and accuracy. In addition to being useful for diagnostics, exosomes hold therapeutic promise given their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and selectively modulate their cargo. These findings suggest that these materials could be used as delivery systems for therapeutic drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This review comprehensively examines the multifaceted roles of exosomes in PD pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. It also addresses the associated clinical challenges and underscores the urgent need for further research and development to fully leverage exosome-based strategies in PD management.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that involves the loss of dopaminergic neurons, which leads to motor and non-motor symptoms that have a significant impact. The pathophysiology of PD is complex and involves environmental and genetic factors that contribute to alpha-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. The current treatments of PD primarily focus on symptom management and have limitations in addressing disease progression and non-motor symptoms. Epidemiological data indicates a rise in PD cases worldwide, which highlights the need for effective treatments. Pathophysiological insights point out the involvement of various factors in PD progression, such as dopamine dysregulation, genetic mutations, oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, alpha-synuclein aggregation, and neuroinflammation. Although current treatments, which include dopamine precursors, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, and non-dopaminergic drugs, can alleviate motor symptoms, they are not effective in preventing disease progression or managing non-motor symptoms. Additionally, they can lead to adverse effects and become less effective over time. Novel therapeutic approaches, including cell-based therapies, gene therapies, targeted drug delivery therapies, and magnetic field therapies, are promising in improving symptom management and providing personalized treatment. Additionally, emerging therapies that target alpha-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation may have potential disease-modifying effects. To sum up, for dealing with the multiple aspects of PD, there is a great need to come up with new and creative therapeutic approaches that not only relieve symptoms, but also prevent the progression of disease and non-motor symptoms. The progress made in comprehending the underlying mechanisms of PD provides optimism for developing successful treatments that can enhance the outcomes and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "To explore the effects of different dose of aerobic exercise on motor function, balance, mobility, and quality of life in Parkinson's disease patients, aiming to provide insights into determining the optimal aerobic exercise dose for treating PD.\nSearching was conducted in four databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane. The dose of aerobic exercise intervention was evaluated based on the recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine regarding the development and maintenance of cardiorespiratory health, muscle strength, and functional mobility in patients with PD. The exercise intervention dose of the included studies were first classified into high ACSM compliance and low ACSM compliance based on meeting 4/6 of the ACSM recommendations. The reliability of the results was then validated using the criterion of meeting 5/6 of the ACSM recommendations. Comparisons of the effects of aerobic exercise dose on Motor function, Balance, Mobility, and QOL in PD patients using standardized mean difference with 95% confidence intervals.\nWhen using the 4/6 ACSM compliance criterion, 17 studies were categorized as high ACSM compliance and 12 as low ACSM compliance. The SMD ratios for high versus low ACSM compliance were: UPDRS-III (-0.79: -0.18), BBS (0.60: 0.05), TUG (-0.60: -0.60), and QOL (-1.05: -0.15). When using the 5/6 ACSM compliance criterion, 11 studies were categorized as high ACSM compliance and 19 as low ACSM compliance. The SMD ratios for high versus low ACSM compliance were: UPDRS-III (-0.95: -0.38), BBS (0.48: 0.37), TUG (-0.71: -0.55), and QOL (-0.7: 0.04).\nThis study provides preliminary support for the potential of aerobic exercise to improve certain clinical symptoms in patients with PD. Furthermore, the results indicate that compliance to higher doses of aerobic exercise, as per ACSM standards, may contribute to improvements in motor function, balance, mobility, and quality of life for patients with PD. However, due to the heterogeneity in the studies and the influence of factors that have not yet been fully explored, these conclusions should be interpreted with caution. More high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed in the future to further verify and clarify the effects of aerobic exercise.\nhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero, identifier PROSPERO: CRD42024517548.",

    "abstract": "Low bone density and osteoporosis are indications for bone-specific treatment. However, given the limited availability of bone density data in clinical practice and the fact that most patients with hip fracture do not have osteoporosis, accurate prediction of hip fracture risk in the absence of bone density data would be crucial.\nThis development and validation study included the entire Swedish population aged 50 years or older in 2005 (N\u00a0=\u00a03,340,977) and was conducted by cross-linking data from nationwide registers. Potential predictive variables included diagnoses, prescription medications, familial factors, frailty-related factors, and socioeconomic factors. The primary endpoint was the 5-year risk of hip fracture. Fracture prediction algorithms were developed and validated using multivariable models. Model performance and validation was also examined in a sub cohort restricted to 504,431 individuals with non-Swedish background.\nDuring a total follow-up of 15.2 million person-years, 87,089 individuals suffered a hip fracture within 5 years. In the final prediction model, 19 variables were associated with a population attributable fraction of 93.9% (95% CI, 93.7-94.1) in women and 92.7% (95% CI, 92.2-93.0) in men. The strongest predictor, besides old age, was the use of homemaker service, with a 5-year risk of hip fracture of 7.8% in women and 4.7% in men. The diagnoses most strongly predicting the 5-year risk of hip fracture was Parkinson's disease (6.8% in women, 4.6% in men) and dementia (6.1% in women, 3.6% in men). Validation of the prediction model suggested that the optimal threshold for treatment with bone-specific agents was an estimated 5-year hip fracture risk of 3%. Assuming a threshold of 3% and a 30% relative risk reduction from bone-specific treatment, the number needed to treat to prevent one hip fracture was estimated to 36 in women and 52 in men. Similar results were obtained in the sub cohort with non-Swedish background.\nA clinical prediction model developed and validated in the total Swedish population could predict the risk of hip fractures with high precision even in absence of data on bone density. The model was associated with a population attributable fraction for hip fracture of more than 90%, and the strongest predictor besides old age was the use of homemaker service, which likely reflect frailty. Based on the model, individuals with an estimated 5-year risk of hip fracture of at least 3% could be considered for bone-specific treatment.\nNone.",

Therefore, the study of acupuncture in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease with mild to moderate depression has important practical significance.\nIn this randomized, single-blinded, and placebo-controlled study, a total of 88 patients with depression in Parkinson's disease (DPD) will be randomly allocated to either an acupuncture group or a control group in parallel in a 1:1 allocation ratio. Each group will receive 30\u2009min acupuncture treatments or sham acupuncture treatments, 3 times a week, for 12\u2009weeks, followed by a 36-week follow-up period. The primary outcome is the response rate of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 at 12\u2009weeks. Data will be collected at baseline, at the end of the 12-week treatment period, and during the 12-week and 36-week follow-up.\nThis study hypothesized that acupuncture may treat DPD by restoring pathological alterations in brain neural activity. The findings will provide scientific evidence for acupuncture in the treatment of early PD with mild to moderate depression.\nThis clinical trial has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Approval No. 2023BL02-013-01). This trial has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry (Registration No. ChiCTR2300069310). The results will be published in a peer-reviewed academic journal.\nhttps://www.chictr.org.cn/, identifier ChiCTR2300069310.",

    "abstract": "The human biological clock is the 24-h internal molecular network of circadian genes in synchronization with other cells in response to external stimuli. The rhythmicity of the clock genes is maintained by positive and negative transcriptional feedback loops coordinating the 24-h oscillation in different tissues. The superchiasmatic nucleus, the central pacemaker of the biological clock diminishes with aging causing alterations in the clock rhythmicity leading to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases mainly Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Studies have shown that brain and muscle Arnt -like 1 (Bmal1) and Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (Clock) gene expression is altered in the onset of neurodegeneration. One of the major symptoms of neurodegeneration is changes in the sleep/wake cycle. Moreover, variations in circadian clock oscillations can happen due to lifestyle changes, addiction to alcohol, cocaine, drugs, smoking, food habits and most importantly eating and sleep/awake cycle patterns which can significantly impact the expression of circadian genes. Recent studies have focused on the molecular function of clock genes affected due to environmental cues. Epigenetic modifications are influenced by the external environmental factors. This review aims to focus on the principal mechanism of epigenetics influencing circadian rhythm disruption leading to neurodegeneration and as well as targeting the epigenetic modulators could be a novel therapeutic approach to combat neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "To avoid the biotoxicity and poor bioavailability of deferoxamine mesylate (DFO), an iron chelation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), a self-oriented DFO nanoparticle functionalized with Exendin-4 was developed, which can be targeted delivered into the lesion brain area to achieve synergistic effects against PD by iron chelation and inflammatory suppression.\nThe self-oriented DFO nanoparticles (Ex-4@DFO NPs) were synthesized by double emulsion technique, and characterized in terms of the particle size, morphology and DFO encapsulation efficiency. The cellular internalization, biocompatibility and cytoprotection of NPs were assessed on BV-2 and SH-SY5Y cells. The brain targeting and therapeutic effect of NPs were investigated in MPTP-induced PD mice by near-infrared II fluorescence imaging and immunofluorescence staining, as well as mobility behavioral tests.\nEx-4@DFO NPs with a particle size of about 100 nm, showed great biocompatibility and cytoprotection in vitro, which inhibited the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential of SH-SY5Y cells and the release of inflammatory factors of BV-2 cells. In MPTP-induced PD mice, Ex-4@DFO NPs could penetrate the BBB into brain, and significantly mitigate the loss of dopaminergic neurons and inflammation in the substantia nigra, finally alleviate the mobility deficits.\nThis self-oriented nanosystem not only improved the biocompatibility of DFO, but also enhanced therapeutic effects synergistically by ameliorating neuronal damage and neuroinflammation, showing a potential therapeutic strategy for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) involves complex molecular interactions and diverse comorbidities. To better understand its molecular mechanisms, we employed systems medicine approaches using the PD map, a detailed repository of PD-related interactions and applied Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBNs) to capture the stochastic nature of molecular dynamics. By integrating cohort-level and real-world patient data, we modeled PD's subtype-specific pathway deregulations, providing a refined representation of its molecular landscape. Our study identifies key regulatory biomolecules and pathways that vary across PD subtypes, offering insights into the disease's progression and patient stratification. These findings have significant implications for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "The classification of Parkinson disease by age of onset has proven to be a valuable method for subtyping, given its practical application in clinical settings. However, the interactions between the metabolic brain changes, dopaminergic dysfunction, and clinical manifestations in patients with early-onset (early-iPD) and late-onset (late-iPD) idiopathic Parkinson disease have not been adequately evaluated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the difference in cerebral metabolism and presynaptic dopaminergic function between patients with early-iPD and those with late-onset disease using \nThis cross-sectional study included 80 patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease and 29 healthy control participants who underwent \nPatients with late-iPD exhibited a significant metabolic decrease in the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortex, along with the globus pallidus, putamen, thalamus, and cerebellum, compared to those with early-iPD in ",

    "abstract": "Internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection is a relatively rare cause of acute ischemic stroke. Stretching and compression of ICA due to sudden acceleration, deceleration, and rotational forces are risk factors for ICA dissection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is believed to trigger an inflammatory response that exacerbates endothelial dysfunction and leads to arterial dissection. Although levodopa-induced cervical dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease often manifests as choreiform movement, dissection has not been reported in such patients.\nA 51-year-old man with Parkinson's disease (PD) presented with gradually worsening neck pain and transient aphasia 1\u00a0week after mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The patient already had neck pain due to cervical spondylosis and presented with levodopa-induced cervical dyskinesia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed acute ischemic stroke in the left parietal lobe and an intramural hematoma with an area of stenosis in the left ICA. The patient was diagnosed with left ICA dissection.\nCOVID-19 infection can cause vessel wall vulnerability. Although patients with PD often have neck pain, ICA dissection should be considered a differential diagnosis if the patient has a recent history of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is a well-established treatment option in Parkinson's disease with motor and non-motor fluctuations allowing for postoperative reduction of dopaminergic medication. However, evidence is scarce on optimal medication adjustments following STN-DBS implantation. Opicapone allows for long-lasting inhibition of the catechol-\nA patient cohort treated with STN-DBS\u00a0+\u00a0levodopa + opicapone (\nWhilst the MDS-UPDRS III (median [min - max]) in patients with STN-DBS as well as anatomical electrode positions did not differ significantly between the opicapone 20 [4-40] and control cohort 14 [1-44], the patients selected for opicapone treatment showed a significantly higher degree of dyskinesias already preoperatively as reflected by a UPDRS-IV A subscore of 2 [0-4] compared to controls 0 [0-4]. Postoperatively, the opicapone cohort showed stronger motor fluctuations MDS-UPDRS IV 6 [0-14] compared to the controls 0 [0-10], albeit without statistical significance. Moreover, the opicapone cohort showed significantly less reduction of dopaminergic medication (-36.4\u00a0% vs. -46.2\u00a0% in the control cohort) following STN-DBS implantation independent from the intake of dopamine agonists.\nThese results indicate a clinical phenotype characterised by more motor fluctuations requiring a more stable dopamine replacement therapy to address the patients' disease biology. In these cases, levodopa + COMT inhibition by opicapone represents a therapeutic approach but determination of the potential clinical benefit requires further prospective studies.",

    "results": "Whilst the MDS-UPDRS III (median [min - max]) in patients with STN-DBS as well as anatomical electrode positions did not differ significantly between the opicapone 20 [4-40] and control cohort 14 [1-44], the patients selected for opicapone treatment showed a significantly higher degree of dyskinesias already preoperatively as reflected by a UPDRS-IV A subscore of 2 [0-4] compared to controls 0 [0-4]. Postoperatively, the opicapone cohort showed stronger motor fluctuations MDS-UPDRS IV 6 [0-14] compared to the controls 0 [0-10], albeit without statistical significance. Moreover, the opicapone cohort showed significantly less reduction of dopaminergic medication (-36.4\u00a0% vs. -46.2\u00a0% in the control cohort) following STN-DBS implantation independent from the intake of dopamine agonists.",

    "abstract": "A 54-year-old male presented with a two-year history of recurrent syncope. Although he was treated with droxidopa and amezinium metilsulfate, his syncope was drug-resistant. Blood tests, cardiac evaluation and brain computed tomography (CT) were unremarkable. As his Schellong test was positive, orthostatic hypotension and syncope were the tentative diagnoses. Upon evaluating the patient neurologically while carefully avoiding syncope induction, mild cerebellar ataxia was observed. However, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a possible \"cross sign\" in the pons.\u00a0Subsequent dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT) showed reduced uptake in the basal ganglia. Based on these findings, a clinical diagnosis of probable multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type (MSA-C) was made, and treatment with taltirelin hydrate was initiated. This case underscores the importance of considering multiple system atrophy (MSA) in patients with persistent orthostatic hypotension and syncope, even before more obvious neurodegenerative symptoms emerge.",

    "abstract": "Segmented electrodes for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinson's disease (PD) enable directional current steering leading to expanded programming options.\nThis retrospective study covering a longitudinal period of up to 7\u00a0years compares the efficacy of segmented and non-segmented leads in motor symptom alleviation and reduction of dopaminergic medication in PD patients treated in a specialized center and assesses the long-term use of directional steering in clinical routine.\nDemographic data and clinical scores before surgery and at 12-month follow-up (12MFU) as well as stimulation parameters at 12MFU and last follow-up (LFU) were assessed in all patients implanted with segmented leads between 01/2016 and 12/2019 and non-segmented leads in a corresponding time-period. Patients were classified as very good (>60\u00a0%), good (30-60\u00a0%) and poor (<30\u00a0%) responders according to DBS-induced motor improvement.\nClinical data at 12MFU was available for 61/96 patients with segmented (SEG) and 42/53 with non-segmented leads (N-SEG). Mean DBS-induced motor improvement and reduction of medication at 12MFU did not differ significantly between SEG and N-SEG groups or in a subgroup analysis of steering modes. There was a lower proportion of poor responders in the SEG compared with the N-SEG group (23% vs. 31%), though not statistically significant. At LFU, the percentage of patients set at directional steering increased from 54% to 70%.\nEfficacy in reduction of motor symptoms and medication does not differ between electrode types for STN-DBS at 12\u00a0months follow-up. The use of directional steering increases over time and may account for a lower proportion of poor responders.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1) is a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidative defenses, and it may play a critical role in Parkinson's disease (PD). F-box/WD repeat domain-containing protein (FBXW7), an E3 protein ligase, promotes the degradation of substrate proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and leads to the clearance of PGC-1\u03b1. Here, we elucidate a novel post-translational mechanism for regulating PGC-1\u03b1 levels in neurons. We show that enhancing chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) activity promotes the CMA-mediated degradation of FBXW7 and consequently increases PGC-1\u03b1. We confirm the relevance of this pathway in vivo by showing decreased FBXW7 and increased PGC-1\u03b1 as a result of boosting CMA selectively in dopaminergic (DA) neurons by overexpressing lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A) in TH-Cre-LAMP2-loxp conditional mice. We further demonstrate that these mice are protected against MPTP-induced oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. These results highlight a novel regulatory pathway for PGC-1\u03b1 in DA neurons and suggest targeted increasing of CMA or decreasing FBXW7 in DA neurons as potential neuroprotective strategies in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving depletion of dopaminergic neurons. Pathogenetic mechanisms leading to striatonigral degeneration are debatable. Chronic inflammation is proposed as one of the mechanisms. In any disease with underlying inflammation, immune system mediators called cytokines are released, leading to a procoagulant state. Our aim was to study the coagulation parameters in patients with PD and find their correlation with disease duration and antiparkinsonian drugs.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2021 and December 2021 in a tertiary care center. Sixty-eight patients with PD were subcategorized based on disease duration (<5 and \u22655 years), number of antiparkinsonian drugs (one drug and \u22652 drugs), and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD; <350 and \u2265350 mg). Hemoglobin (Hb), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, bleeding time, and platelet aggregation study with adenosine diphosphate and collagen were assessed.\nIn our cohort of 68 patients, 53 were men and 15 were women. Mean disease duration was 5.97 \u00b1 4.37 years. Hb was negatively associated with LEDD (P = 0.012) and duration of the disease (P = 0.02). Similarly, PT was negatively associated with disease duration (P = 0.041) and number of antiparkinsonian drugs (P = 0.03). LEDD showed a positive association with collagen-induced platelet aggregation (P = 0.03).\nIn our study, patients using multiple antiparkinsonian drugs and higher LEDD were observed to have a prothrombotic state. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Prior research has underscored the importance of sphingolipid metabolism in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Our objective was to explore the associations between plasma ceramide levels and PD patients with cognitive dysfunction (PD-CD).\nWe enrolled two study populations from Eastern China and the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), comprising 290 (100 HCs, 160 PDs, and 30 MSAs) and 429 (125 HCs and 304 PDs) participants, respectively. The plasma levels of ceramides (Cer 16:0, Cer 18:0, Cer 24:0, and Cer 24:1) were tested via HPLC-MS/MS analysis.\nCompared with those in the HC group, the plasma levels of Cer 18:0, Cer 24:1, Cer 16:0/Cer 24:0, Cer 18:0/Cer 24:0, and Cer 24:1/Cer 24:0 were higher in both the PD and MSA groups. Significant differences in the plasma levels of Cer 16:0/Cer 24:0, Cer 18:0/Cer 24:0, and Cer 24:1/Cer 24:0 were observed among the PD-NC (PD with normal cognition), PD-MCI (PD with mild cognitive impairment), and PDD (PD dementia) groups, with the PDD group exhibiting the highest levels. PD patients with higher baseline levels of plasma ceramides (specifically, Cer 18:0, Cer 16:0/Cer 24:0, Cer 18:0/Cer 24:0, and Cer 24:1/Cer 24:0) demonstrated accelerated cognitive decline compared with individuals who had lower baseline plasma ceramide levels during the 5-year follow-up period. A biomarker panel including Cer 18:0/Cer 24:0 and Cer 24:1/Cer 24:0 could effectively differentiate PD-CD from PD-NC with notable diagnostic accuracy.\nOur results indicate that plasma ceramide levels could potentially be used as diagnostic biomarkers for PD-CD.",

    "abstract": "Lead is one of the most important occupational hazards in China, and occupational exposure is the leading cause of lead poisoning. Lead can be absorbed by the body through air, food, drinking water and skin, and accumulate in multiple organs in the body, posing health risks to humans, especially to lead workers. Many previous studies have shown that lead can affect the function of glial cells such as microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, resulting in irreversible neurological damage. This article provides an overview of the neurotoxic mechanism induced by lead through glial cells, elucidates that lead can induce neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and reviews the relationship between lead and glial cells, in order to provide reference for further research on the neurotoxic mechanism of lead on glial cells.\n\u94c5\u662f\u6211\u56fd\u6700\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u6027\u6709\u5bb3\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u804c\u4e1a\u6027\u94c5\u4e2d\u6bd2\u662f\u94c5\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6700\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u94c5\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u6c14\u3001\u98df\u7269\u3001\u996e\u7528\u6c34\u3001\u76ae\u80a4\u7b49\u8fdb\u5165\u4eba\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u4f53\u5185\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u5668\u5b98\u84c4\u79ef\uff0c\u7ed9\u4eba\u4f53\u9020\u6210\u5065\u5eb7\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u94c5\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5de5\u4eba\u3002\u65e2\u5f80\u8bb8\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u94c5\u53ef\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u80f6\u8d28\u7ec6\u80de\u3001\u661f\u5f62\u80f6\u8d28\u7ec6\u80de\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c11\u7a81\u80f6\u8d28\u7ec6\u80de\u7b49\u80f6\u8d28\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u8f6c\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u635f\u4f24\u3002\u672c\u6587\u6982\u8ff0\u94c5\u901a\u8fc7\u80f6\u8d28\u7ec6\u80de\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6bd2\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9610\u8ff0\u94c5\u53ef\u8bf1\u5bfc\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u3001\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u548c\u808c\u840e\u7f29\u4fa7\u7d22\u786c\u5316\u7b49\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u94c5\u548c\u80f6\u8d28\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u94c5\u5bf9\u80f6\u8d28\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6bd2\u6027\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002.",

    "abstract": "Profiling circulating lipids and metabolites in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients could be useful not only to highlight new pathways affected in PD condition but also to identify sensitive and effective biomarkers for early disease detection and potentially effective therapeutic interventions. In this study we adopted an untargeted omics approach in three group of patients (No L-Dopa, L-Dopa and DBS) to disclose whether long-term levodopa treatment with or without deep brain stimulation (DBS) could reflect a characteristic lipidomic and metabolomic signature at circulating level. Our findings disclosed a wide up regulation of the majority of differentially regulated lipid species that increase with disease progression and severity. We found a relevant modulation of triacylglycerols and acyl-carnitines, together with an altered profile in adiponectin and leptin, that can differentiate the DBS treated group from the others PD patients. We found a highly significant increase of exosyl ceramides (Hex2Cer) and sphingoid bases (SPB) in PD patients mainly in DBS group (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001), which also resulted in a highly accurate diagnostic performance. At metabolomic level, we found a wide dysregulation of pathways involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of several amino acids acids. The most interesting finding was the identification of a specific modulation of L-glutamic acid in the three groups of patients. L-glutamate levels increased slightly in No L-Dopa and highly in L-Dopa patients while decreased in DBS, suggesting that DBS therapy might have a beneficial effect on the glutamatergic cascade. All together, these data provide novel insights into the molecular and metabolic alterations underlying PD therapy and might be relevant for PD prediction, diagnosis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Atrazine (ATR) is a broad-spectrum herbicide with dopaminergic (DAergic) neurotoxicity that can cause Parkinson's disease (PD)-like syndrome. However, research on preventing ATR neurotoxicity is unclear. Soybean isoflavones (SI) are natural plant compounds with neuroprotective effects. In this study, we found that pre-administration of SI prevented ATR-induced motor dysfunction and substantia nigra pathological damage. RNA-seq datasets revealed that the neuroprotective effect of SI was related to autophagy. Further experiments showed that ATR inhibited autophagy, and SI pre-administration before ATR exposure increased autophagy. In addition, single-cell data analysis combined with experimental verification showed that the gene VPS13A was a key target by which SI protected DAergic neurons from ATR damage, and inhibiting VPS13A-induced autophagy was a key mechanism enabling SI prevention of neuron damage. Together, these findings provide new insights for the development of preventive measures and intervention targets protecting against functional neuronal damage caused by ATR and other herbicides.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), a key protein in Parkinson's disease (PD), contributes to progressive neuronal damage associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and interactions with various proteins. However, the precise mechanism by which \u03b1-syn affects energy metabolism remains unclear. In our study, we used human \u03b1-syn (h\u03b1-syn) transgenic mice, which exhibit progressive neuronal decline. Through an immunoprecipitation assay specific to h\u03b1-syn, we identified an enzyme in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle as a binding partner-mitochondrial aconitase 2 (ACO2), which converts citrate to isocitrate. H\u03b1-syn increasingly interacted with ACO2 in mitochondria as mice aged, correlating with a progressive decrease in ACO2 activity. The overexpression of ACO2 and the addition of isocitrate, a downstream metabolite of ACO2, were observed to alleviate h\u03b1-syn-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we designed an interfering peptide to block the interaction between ACO2 and h\u03b1-syn, which showed therapeutic effects in reducing h\u03b1-syn toxicity in vitro and in vivo. Our research establishes a direct link between \u03b1-syn and the TCA cycle and identifies ACO2 as a promising therapeutic target for improving mitochondrial function and reducing \u03b1-syn neurotoxicity in PD.",

    "abstract": "Treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) has been impeded by inefficient treatment results and multiple membrane barriers during drug delivery. This study reports the design, synthesis, and application of microneedles (MNs) loaded with mitochondrion-targeted liposome encapsulated iron (Fe)-isolated single-atom nanozymes (Mito@Fe-ISAzyme, MFeI), called MFeI MNs, for in situ drug delivery into the brain parenchyma and efficient enrichment of drugs in lesion sites. In in vitro experiments, MFeI can scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protect the neurons via mitochondrial targeting, guaranteeing the subsequent treatment of PD. Using PD mouse models, we compared the intravenous injection of MFeI with the brain in situ administration of MFeI MNs (in situ MFeI MNs). Results showed that in situ MFeI MNs significantly improved the deep penetration of the drug into brain parenchyma, especially in the vital pathological sites such as the substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum. Importantly, ROS elimination and neuroinflammatory remission in the lesion site were observed, thereby efficiently alleviating the behavioral disorders and pathological symptoms of PD mice. Therefore, the MNs system for in situ single-atom nanozyme liposome delivery exhibits great potential in PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Iron is an essential mineral that supports numerous biological functions. Studies have reported associations between iron dysregulation and certain cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, but the direction of influence is not clear. Our goal was to use computational approaches to better understand the role of genetically predicted iron levels on disease risk. We meta-analyzed genome-wide association study summary statistics for serum iron levels from two cohorts and two previous meta-analyses. We then obtained summary statistics from 11 neurodegenerative, cerebrovascular, cardiovascular or lipid traits to assess global and regional genetic correlation between iron levels and these traits. We used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate causal effects. Sex-stratified analyses were also carried out to identify effects potentially differing by sex. Overall, we identified three significant global correlations between iron levels and (i) coronary heart disease, (ii) triglycerides, and (iii) high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. A total of 194 genomic regions had significant (after correction for multiple testing) local correlations between iron levels and the 11 tested traits. MR analysis revealed two potential causal relationships, between genetically predicted iron levels and (i) total cholesterol or (ii) non-HDL cholesterol. Sex-stratified analyses suggested a potential protective effect of iron levels on Parkinson's disease risk in females, but not in males. Our results will contribute to a better understanding of the genetic basis underlying iron in cardiovascular and neurological health in aging, and to the eventual identification of new preventive interventions or therapeutic avenues for diseases which affect women and men worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, are small extracellular vesicles that range in size from 30\u00a0nm to 10 \u03bcm in diameter and have specific membrane markers. They are naturally secreted and are present in various bodily fluids, including blood, urine, and saliva, and through the variety of their internal cargo, they contribute to both normal physiological and pathological processes. These processes include immune modulation, neuronal synapse formation, cell differentiation, cancer metastasis, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, progression of infectious disease, and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In recent years, interest has grown in the use of exosomes as a potential drug delivery system for various diseases and injuries. Importantly, exosomes originating from a patient's own cells exhibit minimal immunogenicity and possess remarkable stability along with inherent and adjustable targeting capabilities. This review explores the roles of exosomes in angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and nerve repair with a specific emphasis on these processes within the cornea. Furthermore, it examines exosomes derived from specific cell types, discusses the advantages of exosome-based therapies in modulating these processes, and presents some of the most established methods for exosome isolation. Exosome-based treatments are emerging as potential minimally invasive and non-immunogenic therapies that modulate corneal angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, as well as enhance and accelerate endogenous corneal nerve repair.",

    "abstract": "Ultraprocessed food (UPF) consumption has been associated with depression risk, but its association with depression persistence is unclear.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the association of UPF consumption with depression persistence and incidence.\nThe Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) is a multicenter prospective cohort study with three waves (2008-2010; 2012-2014; 2017-2019). Baseline percentage of energy from UPF, measured using a food frequency questionnaire, was divided into quartiles.\nCivil servants aged 35 to 74 years old at baseline were included in ELSA-Brasil. Participants with Parkinson's disease, dementia, stroke history, extreme energy intake, and missing dietary or depression data at baseline were excluded.\nDepression was based on the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R), depression persistence on depression status at each wave and depression incidence on time to first depression diagnosis.\nClustering large applications algorithm, multinomial logistic regression, Cox proportional-hazard models, and partition substitution model were performed.\nAmong 13,870 participants free from depression at baseline, 731 (5.3%) had depression after eight years of follow-up. Participants in cluster 1 did not have depression in any wave, in cluster 2 had depression in one wave, and in cluster 3 had persistent depression in two or more waves. Compared to the 1st quartile of UPF consumption, participants in quartiles 2, 3, and 4 had a 1.30 (95%CI=1.29; 1.31), 1.39 (95%CI=1.38; 1.40) and 1.58 (95%CI=1.56; 1.60) higher odds of persistent depression (p=0.019), respectively. Compared to the 1st UPF quartile, participants in quartiles 3 and 4 had a 1.32 (95%CI=1.07; 1.64) and 1.30 (95%CI=1.04; 1.61) higher risk of incident depression (p=0.017), respectively. Substituting 5%, 10%, and 20% of UPF with unprocessed/minimally processed foods and culinary ingredients was associated with a 6%, 11%, and 22% decreased depression incidence, respectively.\nHigher consumption of UPF at baseline was associated with higher odds of persistent depression and higher risk of incident depression over eight years of follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation occurs as a consequence of dysfunction in the normal cellular proteostasis, which leads to the accumulation of toxic fibrillar aggregates of certain proteins in the cell. Enhancing the activity of proteolytic pathways may serve as a way of clearing these aggregates in a cell, and consequently, autophagy has surfaced as a promising target for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Several strategies involving small molecule compounds that stimulate autophagic pathway of cell have been discovered. However, despite many compounds having demonstrated favorable outcomes in experimental disease models, the translation of these findings into clinical benefits for patient's remains limited. Consequently, alternative strategies are actively being explored to effectively target neurodegeneration via autophagy modulation. Recently, newer approaches such as modulation of expression of autophagic genes have emerged as novel and interesting areas of research in this field, which hold promising potential in neuroprotection. Similarly, as discussed for the first time in this review, the use of autophagy-inducing nanoparticles by utilizing their physicochemical properties to stimulate the autophagic process, rather than relying on their role as drug carriers, offers a completely fresh avenue for targeting neurodegeneration without the risk of drug-associated adverse effects. This review provides fresh perspectives on developing autophagy-targeted therapies for neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, it discusses the challenges and impediments of implementing these strategies to alleviate the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders in clinical settings and highlights the prospects and directions of future research in this context.",

    "abstract": "Gait disorders are frequently reported in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite extensive research, the specific gait features affected by PD remain inadequately defined. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate kinematic, kinetic, and spatiotemporal parameters of gait in individuals with PD compared to healthy controls.\nWe conducted a systematic review in PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE up to March 2024 to retrieve studies assessing adults with PD, which examined gait compared to healthy controls. Two reviewers independently performed the screening process, extrapolation data and quality assessment. Studies were meta-analyzed using original units of measurement (mean difference, MD) to enhance the clinical understanding of the gait characteristics. The level of evidence was provided.\nThirty-four studies were included (n\u00a0=\u00a01533 participants with PD and n\u00a0=\u00a01093 healthy controls). Moderate-to-strong evidence was found for reduced speed (MD:-0.21\u00a0m/s, 95\u00a0%CI: -0.27; -0.15), stride length (MD:-0.17\u00a0m, 95\u00a0%CI: -0.25; -0.09), swing time (MD:-1.16\u00a0% of gait cycle, 95\u00a0%CI: -2.30; -0.02), and sagittal range of motion of the lower limb joints in individuals with PD (hip: MD:-5.39\u00b0, 95\u00a0%CI: -10.42; -0.37; knee: MD:-11.05\u00b0, 95\u00a0%CI: -21.88; -0.22; ankle: MD:-4.03\u00b0, 95\u00a0%CI: -6.37; -1.69). An increase in double support time (MD:0.07\u00a0s, 95\u00a0%CI: 0.05; 0.10) and a decrease in cadence (MD: -4.93 steps/min, 95\u00a0%CI: -7.89; -1.98) were observed. Kinetic data showed diverse outcomes, making a meta-analysis not possible.\nPD is associated with changes in gait kinematics and spatiotemporal parameters, while kinetic aspects remain under investigated. Future research should focus on kinetics, joint angular velocity, and push-off parameters. PROSPERO registration: CRD42022347368.",

    "abstract": "This intermediate-size expanded access program aimed to evaluate safety and clinical efficacy of multiple intravenous infusions of autologous, Hope Biosciences adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (HB-adMSC) therapy in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nTen eligible participants (aged 76-95 years) received six intravenous infusions each with 200MM autologous HB-adMSCs over 18 weeks, with the end of study (EOS) at week 26. Safety was assessed through adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Efficacy was measured through improvements in both motor and non-motor symptoms, utilizing scales including Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) parts I-IV, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), Parkinson's disease Fatigue Scale (PFS-16), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Analysis employed paired t-tests and Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) thresholds for the patient-reported outcomes.\nMost AEs (37 out of 46) were mild in severity, with 5 SAEs reported, none attributed to the drug. No deaths occurred. Despite lack of statistical significance across the efficacy endpoints, modest yet clinically meaningful improvements with effect size > 0.3 were observed in several secondary efficacy endpoints (MDS-UPDRS part I & III, PDQ-39, and PHQ-9) at the EOS, nearing or surpassing the established MCID values.\nThe administration of autologous 200MM HB-adMSCs was found to be safe and well-tolerated in the elderly PD population. Although not achieving statistical significance, modest clinical improvements were noted across multiple secondary endpoints. These findings underscore the safety profile of the treatment in elderly patients and highlight the importance of evaluating clinical relevance alongside statistical measures for meaningful patient outcomes. Further investigation with a larger, randomized, placebo-controlled design is warranted to validate these observations.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of the support stimulation of the mechanoreceptors of the feet has been first shown in space medicine. In space flight during support withdrawal with non-use of postural muscle, this method is a countermeasure against sensorimotor disorders. Later, it was applied in clinical practice as treatment of motor disorders after stroke, in Parkinson's disease, infantile cerebral palsy, neuropathies, and many others. The impact of such stimulation on motor control is due to spinal and supraspinal mechanisms, which are activated by creating an additional support afferent input through the plantar surface. Many studies confirmed the positive effect of support stimulation on motor control, but the protocols of such stimulation remain the subject of active discussion. This review includes (1) the features of sensitivity of the foot sole cutaneous afferents to the support mechanical stimuli, (2) data on spinal and supraspinal responses of the nervous system to support stimulation, and (3) the results of applying this approach in neurological practice via various techniques. Summarizing this information, the authors highlight the most promising ways and types of medical devices for foot support stimulation in neurology.",

    "abstract": "Glymphatic dysfunction may play a significant role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We aimed to evaluate the association between glymphatic dysfunction and the risk of malignant event/clinical milestones in Parkinson disease (PD).\nThis study included 236 patients from August 2014 to December 2020. Diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index was calculated as an approximate measure of glymphatic function. The primary outcomes were four clinical milestones including recurrent falls, wheelchair dependence, dementia, and placement in residential or nursing home care. The associations of DTI-ALPS with the risk of clinical milestones were examined using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models. Then, logistic regression was repeated using clinical variables and DTI-ALPS index individually and in combination of the two to explore the ability to distinguish patients who reached clinical milestones within a 5-year period.\nA total of 175 PD patients with baseline DTI-ALPS index and follow-up clinical assessments were included. A lower DTI-ALPS was independently associated with increased risk of recurrent falls, wheelchair dependence, and dementia. Additionally, in 103 patients monitored over 5\u2009years, a logistic regression model combining clinical variables and DTI-ALPS index showed better performance for predicting wheelchair dependence within 5\u2009years than a model using clinical variables or DTI-ALPS index alone.\nGlymphatic dysfunction, as measured by the DTI-ALPS index, was associated with increased risk of clinical milestones in patients with PD. This finding implies that therapy targeting the glymphatic system may serve as a viable strategy for slowing down the progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) is an enzyme primarily found in the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum and also highly expressed in the substantia nigra, cerebellum, caudate, hippocampal regions and cerebellar purkinje cells, responsible for selectively breaking down cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) into 5'-GMP and regulate intracellular cGMP levels. As a second messenger, cyclic GMP enhances signals at postsynaptic receptors and triggers downstream effector molecules, leading to changes in gene expression and neuronal responses. Additionally, cGMP signaling transduction cascade, present in the brain, is also essential for learning and memory processes. Mechanistically, PDE5 inhibitors share structural similarities with cGMP, competitively binding to PDE5 and inhibiting cGMP hydrolysis. This action enhances the effects of nitric oxide, resulting in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Neurodegenerative disorders entail the progressive loss of neuron structure, culminating in neuronal cell death, with currently available drugs providing only limited symptomatic relief, rendering neurodegeneration considered incurable. PDE5 inhibitors have recently emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and diseases involving cognitive impairment. This review elucidates the principal roles of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cGMP signaling pathways in neuronal functions, believed to play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders. It provides an updated assessment of PDE5 inhibitors as disease-modifying agents for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral ischemia, Huntington's disease, and neuroinflammation. The paper aims to review the current understanding of PDE5 inhibitors, which concurrently regulate both cAMP and cGMP signaling pathways, positing that they may exert complementary and synergistic effects in modifying neurodegeneration, thus presenting a novel direction in therapeutic discovery. Moreover, the review provides critical about biological functions, therapeutic potentials, limitations, challenges, and emerging applications of selective PDE5 inhibitors. This comprehensive overview aims to guide future academic and industrial endeavors in this field.",

    "abstract": "Certain structural variants (SVs) including large-scale genetic copy number variants, as well as copy number-neutral inversions and translocations may not all be resolved by chromosome karyotype studies. The identification of genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD) has been primarily focused on the gene-disruptive single nucleotide variants. In contrast, larger SVs, which may significantly influence human phenotypes, have been largely underexplored. Optical genomic mapping (OGM) represents a novel approach that offers greater sensitivity and resolution for detecting SVs. In this study, we used induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines of patients with PD-linked SNCA and PRKN variants as a proof of concept to (i) show the detection of pathogenic SVs in PD with OGM and (ii) provide a comprehensive screening of genetic abnormalities in iPSCs.\nOGM detected SNCA gene triplication and duplication in patient-derived iPSC lines, which were not identified by long-read sequencing. Additionally, various exon deletions were confirmed by OGM in the PRKN gene of iPSCs, of which exon 3-5 and exon 2 deletions were unable to phase with conventional multiplex-ligation-dependent probe amplification. In terms of chromosomal abnormalities in iPSCs, no gene fusions, no aneuploidy but two balanced inter-chromosomal translocations were detected in one line that were absent in the parental fibroblasts and not identified by routine single nucleotide variant karyotyping.\nIn summary, OGM can detect pathogenic SVs in PD-linked genes as well as reveal genomic abnormalities for iPSCs that were not identified by other techniques, which is supportive for OGM's future use in gene discovery and iPSC line screening.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia contribute to internal timekeeping, and dopaminergic medication has been observed to moderate timing deficits associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD) during single joint movements. However, it is unclear whether similar effects can be observed in multi-joint movements. Twenty-five people with PD and twelve healthy peers performed repetitive reaching and stepping-in-place tasks with and without auditory cues at their self-selected maximal cadence. The PD group was measured ON and OFF medication. Reduced cadence error was found for both groups and tasks when cued, and ON PD exhibited decreased cadence compared to OFF PD. Overall timing variability was no different from controls, but differences were found in estimates of clock and motor variance using the Wing-Kristofferson model of interval timing. A medication and cueing interaction during the reaching task produced increased clock variance in uncued, ON PD. During the stepping task, clock and motor variance of the PD group were unaffected by cues, in contrast to the control group. Serial lag-one correlation was reduced in both groups for cued reaching, but was unaffected by cueing or medication in the PD group when stepping-in-place. These findings suggest that overall timing variability may not capture timing deficits in PD.",

    "abstract": "Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) involvement in neurological diseases has been extensively documented, although the etiology of HERV reactivation remains unclear. MicroRNAs represent one of the potential regulatory mechanisms of HERV reactivation. We identified fourteen microRNAs predicted to bind the HERV-K transcript, and subsequently analyzed for their gene expression levels alongside those of HERV-K. We documented an increased expression of four microRNAs in patients with Parkinson's disease compared to healthy controls, which correlated with a downregulation of HERV-K transcripts. We hypothesize that specific microRNAs may bind to HERV-K transcripts, leading to its downregulation.",

    "abstract": "The onset of the symptoms of subcortical NDs is due to a unique part of the brain which strengthens the idea of reciprocal influence of physical activity and cognitive training in improving clinical symptoms. Consequently, protocols combining the two stimulations are becoming increasingly popular in NDs. Our threefold aim was to (A) describe the different combinations of physical and cognitive training used to alleviate the motor and cognitive symptoms of patients with subcortical neurodegenerative disorders, (B) compare the effects of these different combinations (sequential, dual tasking, synergical) on symptoms, and (C) recommend approaches for further studies.\nWe conducted literature searches of PubMed, BASE and ACM, to carry out a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and controlled trials of combined physical and cognitive training among patients with Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lewy body dementia, spinocerebellar ataxia, Friedreich's ataxia, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Physical, neuropsychological, behavioral outcomes were considered. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to verify the critical appraisal.\nTwenty-one studies focused on Parkinson's disease with 940 participants were included. Despites promising benefits on cognitive and physical function, our results revealed discrepant findings for research on combined training.\nInconsistencies were linked to the choice of tests, the functions that were targeted, disease progression, and trainings. There was a dearth of follow-up data.\nDifferences between combined training are unclear, particularly regarding the role of cognitive load. Future studies should focus on comparing the feasibility, tolerability, and effectiveness of different combinations of motor-cognitive training.",

    "abstract": "The ability to mount an interferon-mediated innate immune response is essential in protection against neurotropic viruses, but antiviral type I interferons also have neurotoxic potential. The production of type I interferons can be triggered by self-derived nucleic acids, and the brain can be susceptible to inappropriate upregulation of type I interferon signalling. Homoeostatic dysregulation of type I interferons has been implicated in rare inborn errors of immunity (referred to as type I interferonopathies) and more common neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Recent developments include new insights into the pathogenesis of these disorders that involve dysregulated type I interferon signalling, as well as advances in their diagnosis and management. The role of type I interferons in brain cellular health suggests the future therapeutic potential of approaches that target these interferons and their signalling.",

    "abstract": "Retrotransposable elements (RTEs) are common mobile genetic elements comprising \u223c42% of the human genome. RTEs play critical roles in gene regulation and function, but how they are specifically involved in complex diseases is largely unknown. Here, we investigate the cellular heterogeneity of RTEs using 12 single-cell transcriptome profiles covering three neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. We identify cell type marker RTEs in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells that are related to these diseases. The differential expression analysis reveals the landscape of dysregulated RTE expression, especially L1s, in excitatory neurons of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Machine learning algorithms for predicting cell disease stage using a combination of RTE and gene expression features suggests dynamic regulation of RTEs in AD. Furthermore, we construct a single-cell atlas of retrotransposable elements in neurodegenerative disease (scARE) using these data sets and features. scARE has six feature analysis modules to explore RTE dynamics in a user-defined condition. To our knowledge, scARE represents the first systematic investigation of RTE dynamics at the single-cell level within the context of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are associated with the formation of amyloid fibrils. In familial cases, the mutant causative genes accentuate disease progression through overexpression or misfolding of amyloidogenic proteins. Besides, considerable amyloidosis cases arise from external factors, but their origin and mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Herein, we found that amyloid fibrils generated from egg and milk proteins, in addition to their nutritional effects to intestinal cells, can selectively reduce the viability of nervous cells as well as pancreatic islet cells. In contrast, soy protein amyloid fibrils lacked cytotoxicity to the aforementioned cells. This protein source and cell type-dependent cytotoxicity are demonstrated to be associated with the significant upregulation of amyloidogenic proteins. The finding was also confirmed by the vein injection of beta-lactoglobulin fibrils to mice, exhibiting the pronounced upregulations of amyloid beta",

    "abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent mRNA modification in eukaryotic cells, characterized by its reversible nature. YTH structural domain family protein 2 (YTHDF2), a key reader of m6A, plays a crucial role in identifying and binding m6A-containing RNAs, thereby influencing RNA metabolism through various functional mechanisms. The upstream and downstream targets of YTHDF2 are critical in the pathogenesis of various central nervous system (CNS) diseases, affecting disease development by regulating signaling pathways and gene expression. This paper provides an overview of current research on the role of YTHDF2 in CNS diseases and investigates the regulatory mechanisms by which YTHDF2 influences the development of these conditions. This exploration aims to improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and offer novel insights for the targeted prevention and treatment of neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders involve diverse changes in brain functional connectivity. As an alternative to approaches searching for specific mosaic patterns of affected connections and networks, we used polyconnectomic scoring to quantify disorder-related whole-brain connectivity signatures into interpretable, personalized scores.\nThe polyconnectomic score (PCS) measures the extent to which an individual's functional connectivity (FC) mirrors the whole-brain circuitry characteristics of a trait. We computed PCS for eight neuropsychiatric conditions (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety-related disorders, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia) and three neurodegenerative conditions (Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson's disease) across 22 datasets with resting-state functional MRI of 10,667 individuals (5,325 patients, 5,342 controls). We further examined PCS in 26,673 individuals from the population-based UK Biobank cohort.\nPCS was consistently higher in out-of-sample patients across six of the eight neuropsychiatric and across all three investigated neurodegenerative disorders ([min, max]: AUC = [0.55, 0.73], p\nOur findings reveal generalizable whole-brain connectivity alterations in brain disorders. PCS effectively aggregates disorder-related signatures across the entire brain into an interpretable, subject-specific metric. A toolbox is provided for PCS computation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting the motor system, with symptoms including tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Affecting over six million people globally, PD's pathophysiology is marked by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management, yet current methods are limited by low sensitivity, high cost, and the need for advanced equipment. Electrochemical biosensors have emerged as promising tools for early PD diagnosis, converting biological reactions into measurable electrical signals for evaluating PD biomarkers. Advances in nanotechnology and material science have led to innovative sensing platforms with enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. Key biomarkers such as alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), dopamine (DA), and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been targeted using these biosensors. For instance, gold nanoparticle-modified graphene immunosensors have shown ultra-sensitive detection of \u03b1-syn, while graphene-based biosensors have demonstrated high sensitivity for DA detection. Additionally, nanobiosensors for miR-195 and electrochemical aptasensors have shown potential for early PD diagnosis. The integration of nanomaterials like gold nanoparticles, quantum dots, and carbon nanotubes has further advanced the field, enhancing electrochemical activity and sensitivity. These developments offer a reliable, rapid, and cost-effective approach for early PD diagnosis, paving the way for better management and treatment. Continued research is essential for the commercialization and clinical integration of these biosensors, ultimately improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Speech impairment is a common and disabling symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), affecting communication and quality of life. Advances in digital speech processing and artificial intelligence have revolutionized objective speech analysis. Given the complex nature of speech impairment, acoustic speech analysis offers unique biomarkers for neuroprotective treatments from the prodromal stages of PD. Digital speech biomarkers can monitor levodopa-induced motor complications, detect the effects of deep brain stimulation, and provide feedback for behavioral speech therapy. This review updates the mechanisms underlying speech impairment, the impact of speech phenotypes, and the effects of interventions on speech. We evaluate the strengths, potential weaknesses, and suitability of promising digital speech biomarkers in PD for capturing disease progression and treatment efficacy. Additionally, we explore the translational potential of PD speech biomarkers to other neuropsychiatric diseases, offering insights into motion, cognition, and emotion. Finally, we highlight knowledge gaps and suggest directions for future research to enhance the use of quantitative speech measures in disease-modifying clinical trials. The findings demonstrate that one year is sufficient to detect disease progression in early PD through speech biomarkers. Voice quality, pitch, loudness, and articulation measures appear to capture the efficacy of treatment interventions most effectively. Certain speech features, such as loudness and articulation rate, behave oppositely in different neurological diseases, offering valuable insights for differential diagnosis. In conclusion, this review highlights speech as a biomarker in tracking disease progression, especially in the prodromal stages of PD, and calls for further longitudinal studies to establish its efficacy across diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "Neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels were reliable biomarkers of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). Lipoprotein-related Phospholipase A2(Lp-PLA2) levels have also been increasingly studied in PD. We aimed to explore the association of plasma NfL and Lp-PLA2 with the diagnosis, motor subtypes and disease severity of PD. Plasma NfL and Lp-PLA2 were assayed separately in 106 participants (74 PD and 32 healthy controls, HC). The motor subtypes of PD were classified according to the MDS-UPDRS components, and motor and non-motor manifestations of patients were also evaluated. Subsequently, correlation analyses were performed. The plasma NfL levels were higher in the PD than HC, and were positively correlated with age, UPDRS II, UPDRS III and the modified Hoehn and Yahr staging scale (H&Y stage) in the PD. Moreover, plasma Lp-PLA2 levels were lower in the PD than HC, and were positively correlated with Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39) in the PD. For further distinguishing tremor-dominant (TD) from postural instability and gait difficulty-dominant (PIGD), plasma Lp-PLA2 levels were higher in the TD than PIGD, but there was no significant difference in NfL. plasma Lp-PLA2 levels were positively correlated with UPDRS I, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and PDQ-39 in the TD. These resultssuggest that NfL and Lp-PLA2 may be potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of PD. We first demonstrated the potential utility of plasma Lp-PLA2 in differentiating motor subtypes. These findings deserve further evidence in larger PD cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Ozone (O\u2083), a potent oxidant, can penetrate the body through breathing, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggering inflammatory processes. Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the production of ROS and the body's antioxidant capacity, plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases. This phenomenon can negatively impact the Central Nervous System (CNS), inducing structural and functional alterations that contribute to the development of neurological pathologies. This review examines how O\u2083-induced oxidative stress affects the nervous system by analyzing existing literature on the involved molecular mechanisms and potential antioxidant systems to mitigate its effects. Through a comprehensive review of experimental studies, our objective is to shed light on the interaction between O\u2083 and the nervous system, as well as its signaling pathways and altered genes, providing a foundation for future research in this field. Several studies have demonstrated that prolonged exposure to O\u2083 leads to increased expression of reactive oxygen species, causing alterations in the blood-brain barrier and damage to astrocytes and microglia. These effects can lead to an increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, neurotoxins, and genes, exacerbating neuronal damage and accelerating the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurological disorders. The results of this review suggest that exposure to O\u2083 may induce oxidative damage to the nervous system, which could have significant implications for public health.",

    "abstract": "Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has emerged as a key regulator of cellular processes linked to ageing and neurodegeneration. SIRT1 modulates various signalling pathways, including those involved in autophagy, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function, which are critical in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the therapeutic potential of SIRT1 in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 activators, such as resveratrol, SRT1720, and SRT2104, can alleviate disease symptoms by reducing oxidative stress, enhancing autophagic flux, and promoting neuronal survival. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of these SIRT1 activators, providing hope for future therapeutic strategies targeting SIRT1 in neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the role of SIRT1 in ageing and neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on its molecular mechanisms, therapeutic potential, and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Ventricular pre-excitation (VPE) occurs when atrial electrical impulses prematurely excite the ventricles through an aberrant muscle bundle known as an accessory pathway (AP). Orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia is a re-entrant, narrow complex supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), maintained through retrograde conduction over an AP. The study aimed to describe patient signalments, clinical signs, electrocardiographic (ECG) and diagnostic imaging features, treatments, prognostic variables, and outcomes in cats with ECG diagnosis of VPE.\nTwenty-three cats diagnosed with VPE between January 2010 and August 2022 were included in this study.\nThis was a multicenter, retrospective study with twenty-three cats diagnosed with VPE between January 2010 and August 2022. Ventricular pre-excitation diagnosis was based on ECG evidence of shortened PR interval, delta wave, and prolonged QRS duration. The median survival time (MST) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier curve. Log-rank tests were performed to assess for an association between clinical signs or presence of structural heart disease on the MST.\nFourteen (60.8%) cats with VPE also had SVT documented on ECG, with 7 of 14 with ECG confirmation of orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia. Four (17.4%) cats had suspected AP-mediated tachyarrhythmia based on associated clinical signs. Common presenting signs included collapse (15/23; 65.2%) and respiratory distress (14/23; 60.8%). Five (21.7%) cats were asymptomatic. Heart rate during SVT ranged from 310 to 420 bpm (median: 375 bpm). Initial treatment included atenolol (10/18), sotalol (5/18), diltiazem (2/18), and amiodarone (1/18). From the date of diagnosis, MST was 1872 days (5.1 years).\nThe majority of cats with VPE also had symptomatic SVT. The prognosis for cats with VPE is considered good with an MST of greater than five years.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD) and Parkinson plus syndrome (PPS), inflammation is recognized as a relevant or contributing factor in the advancement of the diseases. For this reason, numerous biomarkers signaling immune alteration in both the central and peripheral nervous systems have been evaluated in PD and PPS. Nonetheless, the comprehensive inflammatory indices derived from readily available standard blood tests in PD, PPS, and healthy controls (HC) were rarely evaluated especially in the early stage of the diseases.\nThe aim of this study is to explore the serum level of peripheral inflammatory markers among the patients and investigate whether these markers contribute to symptoms.\nClinical data and blood test results from drug na\u00efve, early-stage 139 PD and 87 PPS patients, along with 139 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) to PD were enrolled, with exclusion criteria applied to conditions potentially affecting inflammation. The study examined the disparities in peripheral inflammation among the groups, using total and subpopulation of white blood cells (WBCs), platelet count, red cell distribution width (RDW), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and other composite values reflecting inflammation including RDW to platelet ratio (RPR), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil to HDL-C ratio (NHR), monocyte to HDL-C ratio (MHR), lymphocyte to HDL-C ratio (LHR), platelet to HDL-C ratio (PHR), systemic inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), and aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI).\nThe MHR values were significantly higher in both PD and PPS groups compared to HC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and NHR was significantly higher in the PPS group only compared to the HC group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, no significant differences in all the inflammatory markers were observed between PPS and PD (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Subgroup analysis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients revealed significantly higher NHR and MHR levels compared to the HC group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025, p\u00a0=\u00a00.050, respectively), with no significant difference among PSP, MSA, and PD groups. After adjustment for age, sex, and disease duration, MHR was positively associated with H&Y in the total population (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.288, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), negatively associated with MMSE in the PD group (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.245, p\u00a0=\u00a00.017), and positively associated with both H&Y (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.432, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and UPDRS part II (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.295, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018) in PPS group.\nNHR and MHR values are not effective as reliable diagnostic markers due to overlap among groups and their limited discriminative capacity in ROC analyses. However, MHR may potentially serve as an indicator reflecting peripheral inflammation in the early stage of PD and PPS compared to HC.",

    "abstract": "Stem cell therapies for Parkinson's disease are at an exciting time of development, and several clinical trials have recently been initiated. Human pluripotent stem cells are differentiated into transplantable dopamine (DA) progenitors which are proliferative at the time of grafting and undergo terminal differentiation and maturation in vivo. While the progenitors are homogeneous at the time of transplantation, they give rise to heterogeneous grafts composed not only of therapeutic DA neurons but also of other mature cell types. The mechanisms for graft diversification are unclear. We used single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to profile DA progenitors before transplantation combined with molecular barcode-based tracing to determine origin and shared lineages of the mature cell types in the grafts. Our data demonstrate that astrocytes, vascular leptomeningeal cells, and DA neurons are the main component of the DAergic grafts, originating from a common progenitor that is tripotent at the time of transplantation.",

    "abstract": "The impact of non-motor symptoms is often overlooked in favour of the motor symptoms when managing Parkinson's disease resulting in suboptimal patient outcomes. This study aimed to characterise the non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease in a cohort of Sri Lankan patients with a special focus on the impulsive control disorders and other compulsive behaviours (ICDs-CB) that had not been previously studied in this population. All patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease followed up at the National Hospital of Colombo, Sri Lanka were included. The presence or absence of non-motor symptoms and their perceived impact was recorded with an interviewer administered questionnaire. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed with Hamilton Anxiety and Depression scales. Presence of ICDs-CB was assessed with the questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease. Of 192 patients 97% (186) reported at least 2 non-motor symptoms. About 83% (160/192) screened positive for anxiety, 40% (76/192) for depression, and 17% (32/192) for an ICDs-CB. A lower Barthel index, history of past psychiatric disorders and family history of alcohol abuse were independent predictors of ICDs-DB. Managing both motor and non-motor symptoms are important to preserve the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease. They should be screened for symptoms for anxiety and depression regularly during follow up and educated about the possibility of ICDs-CB soon after diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Eye tracking assessments in the laboratory have previously highlighted clear differences in eye movements between Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy aging. However, laboratory-based eye movement tasks are artificial and limit the ecological validity of observed results. Eye movement tasks utilizing more naturalistic scenarios may provide more accurate insight into cognitive function but research in this area is limited.\nThis systematic review aims to ascertain what naturalistic tasks have revealed about oculomotor deficits in PD and what this information may help us understand about the underlying sensorimotor and cognitive processes.\nAdhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, a literature search of PsycInfo, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted using predetermined search terms. Articles including both individuals with PD and healthy older adults completing eye tracking tasks involving naturalistic eye movements (e.g., reading, video-watching, unrestricted visual search) or naturalistic stimuli were included.\nAfter screening, 30 studies were identified as matching the inclusion criteria. Results revealed consistent findings across tasks, including longer fixation durations and smaller saccadic amplitudes in PD compared to healthy aging. However, inconsistencies in the literature and a lack of standardization in tasks limit interpretation of these results.\nNaturalistic eye movement tasks highlight some consistent differences in eye movements between people with PD and healthy aging. However, future research should expand the current literature in this area and strive towards standardization of naturalistic tasks that can preferably be conducted remotely.\nPrevious studies using eye tracking in a laboratory environment have shown clear differences in eye movements between people with Parkinson\u2019s disease and healthy older adults. However, eye movements produced during lab-based tasks do not fully imitate eye movements produced during real-life situations, making findings from these studies less applicable to everyday life. Collecting eye movement data during tasks that mimic everyday activities might therefore provide more accurate information regarding cognitive ability in Parkinson\u2019s disease. We reviewed studies that explored eye movements during everyday tasks in Parkinson\u2019s disease to better understand what these studies might be able to tell us about the underlying cognitive processes involved in these tasks. 30 studies were summarized, including studies exploring eye movements during reading, real-life simulations, free viewing, and goal-oriented tasks with natural stimuli. A common finding from the reviewed studies was that Parkinson\u2019s patients fixated their gaze for longer and produced smaller eye movements when viewing the presented visual stimuli (e.g., pictures, texts). Nevertheless, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about differences in eye movements between people with Parkinson\u2019s disease and healthy controls, as there were many inconsistent findings across the studies. These inconsistencies could be attributed to differences in how the tasks were designed and the types of data collected. We therefore encourage researchers in this field to work towards improving the designs of these tasks to allow for easier comparisons, ideally producing tasks that can be conducted remotely to allow for large quantities of data collection.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative condition that exerts a significant global burden. Despite recent efforts, disease modifying therapies remain extremely limited, with a tremendous proportion of patients having to rely on symptomatic treatment only. Epidemiological and pathological overlaps exist between Alzheimer's disease and diabetes mellitus type 2, with people with diabetes mellitus type 2 at a significantly increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in the future. Incretin mimetics, also known as GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists, are useful tools licensed for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 which have recently been the subject of news coverage for their off-label use as weight loss medications. Emerging evidence highlights the possible neuroprotective function of incretin mimetics in models of Alzheimer's disease as well as in clinical studies. This review details the pre-clinical and clinical studies that have explored the effectiveness of incretin mimetics to alleviate Alzheimer's disease associated pathology and cognitive impairment, while also highlighting the progress made to examine the effectiveness of these molecules in Parkinson's disease. Should clinical trials prove effective, incretin mimetics may be able to be repurposed and become useful novel tools as disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Functional impairments in the brain's insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signal transduction networks are recognized mediators of dysregulated energy metabolism, a major driver of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurodegeneration cascade. AD-associated insulin-deficient and insulin-resistant states mimic those of diabetes mellitus and affect all cell types in the brain. Besides accounting for abundant amyloid-\u03b2 and hyperphosphorylated tau lesions in AD, insulin/IGF pathway dysfunctions cause cortical atrophy, loss of synaptic plasticity, white matter myelin/oligodendrocyte degeneration, astrocyte and microglial neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, deficits in energy metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and microvascular disease. These same neuropathological processes have been linked to cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and vascular dementia. Strategies to address metabolic mediators of cognitive impairment have been borrowed from diabetes and other insulin-resistant diseases and leveraged on preclinical AD model data. The repurposing of diabetes drugs led to clinical trials with intranasal insulin, followed by insulin sensitizers including metformin and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor agonists, and then incretin mimetics primarily targeting GLP-1 receptors. In addition, other glucose-lowering agents have been tested for their efficacy in preventing cognitive declines. The strengths and limitations of these approaches are discussed. The main conclusion of this review is that we have now arrived at a stage in which it is time to address long-term deficits in trophic factor availability and receptor responsiveness, signaling abnormalities that extend beyond insulin and include IGFs and interconnected pathways, and the need for multi-pronged rather than single-pronged therapeutic targeting to remediate AD and other forms of neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Stem cell therapies are progressively redefining the treatment landscape for a spectrum of neurological and age-related disorders. This review discusses the molecular and functional attributes of stem cells, emphasizing the roles of neural stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells in the context of neurological diseases such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The review also explores the potential of stem cells in addressing the aging process. The paper analyzes stem cells' intrinsic properties of self-renewal, differentiation, and paracrine effects, alongside the importance of laboratory-modified stem cells like induced pluripotent stem cells and transgenic stem cells. Insights into disease-specific stem cell treatments are offered, reviewing both successes and challenges in the field. This includes the translational difficulties from rodent studies to human trials. The review concludes by acknowledging the uncharted territories that warrant further investigation, emphasizing the potential roles of stem cell-derived exosomes and indole-related molecules, and aiming at providing a basic understanding of stem cell therapies.",

    "abstract": "Erythropoietin (EPO) is the main hematopoietic growth factor prescribed to overcome anemia. It is also a neuroprotective agent. EPO binds to the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), expressed on neurons and glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), and exerts its neuroprotective potencies through the EPO-EPOR complex. The mechanism of the signal transduction pathways of EPO on glial cells is defined. EPO-EPOR complex can affect neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ischemia, retinal injury, stroke, hypoxia, trauma, and demyelinating diseases, through acting downstream signaling pathways. This review focuses on the roles of EPO in different types of glial cells (astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells) and their relationships with signaling pathways. Information on the non-erythropoietic action of EPO and related signaling systems in connection with glial cells could enhance EPO treatment to restore different CNS disorders and propose new perspectives on the neuroprotective potential of EPO.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, whose characteristic pathology involves progressive deficiency of dopaminergic neurons and generation of Lewy bodies (LBs). Aggregated and misfolded \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) is the major constituent of LBs. As the newly discovered pathway of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) and receptor Mas have attracted increasing attentions for their correlation with PD, but underlying mechanisms remain not fully clear. Based on above, this study established PD models of mice and primary dopaminergic neurons with AAV-h\u03b1-syn(A53T), then discussed the effects of Ang-(1-7)/Mas on \u03b1-syn level and neuronal apoptosis for these models combined with downstream long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). Results showed that Ang-(1-7) alleviated behavioral impairments, rescued dopaminergic neurons loss and lowered \u03b1-syn expression in substantia nigra of h\u03b1-syn(A53T) overexpressed PD mice. We also discovered that Ang-(1-7) decreased level of \u03b1-syn and apoptosis in the h\u03b1-syn(A53T) overexpressed dopaminergic neurons through lncRNA NEAT1/miR-153-3p axis. Moreover, miR-153-3p level in peripheral blood is found negatively correlated with that of \u03b1-syn. In conclusion, our work not only showed neuroprotective effect and underlying mechanisms for Ang-(1-7) on \u03b1-syn ",

    "abstract": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) are tauopathic atypical parkinsonisms. Given their overlap in terms of clinical manifestation, there is growing interest in the mechanisms leading to these entities.\nIn total, 71 patients were included in the study, 19 of whom were clinically diagnosed with CBS, 37 with PSP, and 15 with Parkinson's disease (PD). The mean ages of the participants were 72.8, 72.9, and 64.0 years, respectively, and the disease duration varied from 3 to 6 years. Each individual underwent blood collection. Morphological and biochemical evaluation of blood samples was performed to analyze the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and neutrophil-to-high-density lipoprotein ratio (NHR). A single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (\nThe study revealed a negative linear correlation between NHR and perfusion of both the left (Insula L; R = -0.59) and right (Insula R; R = -0.58) insula regions. Similar to the insula, a linear correlation between NHR and activity in both the left (Thalamus L) and right (Thalamus R) thalamus regions in CBS subjects with a relatively stronger correlation in the right thalamus (R = -0.64 vs. R = -0.58) was found. These observations were not confirmed in PSP and PD patients.\nSimultaneously using non-specific parameters for peripheral inflammation (NLR, PLR, and NHR) and perfusion, SPECT may be an interesting beginning point for further analysis of inflammatory disease mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address the potential correlation between the peripheral neuroinflammatory markers NLR, PLR, and NHR and perfusion disturbances in particular ROIs.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. Patients also experience\u00a0non-motor symptoms that greatly affect their quality of life.\u00a0The global prevalence of PD is increasing, especially among the elderly, necessitating effective treatment strategies. This review provides an overview of the current treatment modalities for PD, including pharmacological and surgical interventions, and employs a bibliometric analysis to evaluate the trends and impact of scientific research in this field.\u00a0A comprehensive search of the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database was conducted on July 12, 2024, yielding 3,724 publications related to PD treatment. Bibliometric analysis was performed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer to assess publication trends, impact, and collaborative networks. Metrics such as the number of publications, citations, h-index, and country/institutional contributions were analyzed to identify key areas of focus and influential research in PD treatment.\u00a0The analysis revealed a significant increase in PD research output from 2000 onwards, peaking between 2011 and 2016. The United States led in research production, followed by China, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Key researchers included Lang AE, Okun MS, and Lozano AM, with the University of Toronto, University of California System, and Harvard University being the top contributing institutions. The study identified major trends in pharmacological treatments, such as dopamine replacement therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS) as the most common surgical intervention. Bibliometric analysis highlighted significant international collaborations and identified influential studies shaping the current understanding and treatment of PD.\u00a0This bibliometric analysis elucidated the trends and impacts of scientific contributions, emphasizing the prolific output from leading countries and institutions in relation to the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Take-home messages for the conclusion of our study are as follows: (1) this study found a substantial increase in Parkinson's disease (PD) research output from 2000 onwards, peaking around 2017-2018, (2) noted a decline in publication output post-2020, (3) the United States had the highest research output, followed by significant contributions from countries like China, Canada, and the United Kingdom, (4) international collaborations played a vital role in advancing PD research, (5) key researchers in the field were Lang AE, Okun MS, and Lozano AM, (6) and established institutions like the University of Toronto, Johns Hopkins University and Harvard University made substantial contributions to the field, emphasizing the role of leading academic centers in driving PD research.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in transcriptomics research have uncovered heightened interferon (IFN) responses in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, primary tauopathy, Parkinson's disease, TDP-43 proteinopathy, and related mouse models. Augmented IFN signaling is now relatively well established for microglia in these contexts, but emerging work has highlighted a novel role for IFN-responsive T cells in the brain and peripheral blood in some types of neurodegeneration. These findings complement a body of literature implicating dysregulated IFN signaling in neuropsychiatric disorders including major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. In this review, we will characterize and integrate advances in our understanding of IFN responses in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease, discuss how sex and ancestry modulate the IFN response, and examine potential mechanistic explanations for the upregulation of antiviral-like IFN signaling pathways in these seemingly non-viral neurological and psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "The causal relationship between cathepsins and neurological diseases remains uncertain. To address this, we utilized a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to assess the potential causal effect of cathepsins on the development of neurological diseases.\nThis study conducted a two-sample two-way MR study using pooled data from published genome-wide association studies to evaluate the relationship between 10 cathepsins (B, D, E, F, G, H, L2, O, S, and Z) and 7 neurological diseases, which included ischemic stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and epilepsy. The analysis employed various methods such as inverse variance weighting (IVW), weighted median, MR Egger regression, MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier, Cochran Q statistic, and leave-one-out analysis.\nWe found a causal relationship between cathepsins and neurological diseases, including Cathepsin B and Parkinson's disease (IVW odds ratio (OR): 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83, 0.95, \nOur study reveals a causal relationship between Cathepsins B, D, E, and O and neurological diseases, offering valuable insights for research aimed at improving the diagnosis and treatment of such conditions.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by multiple neurotransmitter systems beyond the traditional dopaminergic pathway, yet their influence on volumetric alterations is not well comprehended. We included 72 de novo, drug-na\u00efve Parkinson's disease patients and 61 healthy controls. Voxel-wise gray matter volume was evaluated between Parkinson's disease and healthy controls, as well as among Parkinson's disease subgroups categorized by clinical manifestations. The Juspace toolbox was utilized to explore the spatial relationship between gray matter atrophy and neurotransmitter distribution. Parkinson's disease patients exhibited widespread GM atrophy in the cerebral and cerebellar regions, with spatial correlations with various neurotransmitter receptors (FDR-P\u2009<\u20090.05). Cognitively impaired Parkinson's disease patients showed gray matter atrophy in the left middle temporal atrophy, which is associated with serotoninergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic receptors (FDR-P\u2009<\u20090.05). Postural and gait disorder patients showed atrophy in the right precuneus, which is correlated with serotoninergic, dopaminergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and opioid receptors (FDR-P\u2009<\u20090.05). Patients with anxiety showed atrophy in the right superior orbital frontal region; those with depression showed atrophy in the left lingual and right inferior occipital regions. Both conditions were linked to serotoninergic and dopaminergic receptors (FDR-P\u2009<\u20090.05). Parkinson's disease patients exhibited regional gray matter atrophy with a significant distribution of specific neurotransmitters, which might provide insights into the underlying pathophysiology of clinical manifestations and develop targeted intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "The Parkinson's Families Project is a UK-wide study aimed at identifying genetic variation associated with familial and early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). We recruited individuals with a clinical diagnosis of PD and age at motor symptom onset \u226445 years and/or a family history of PD in up to third-degree relatives. Where possible, we also recruited affected and unaffected relatives. We analysed DNA samples with a combination of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array genotyping, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We investigated the association between identified pathogenic mutations and demographic and clinical factors such as age at motor symptom onset, family history, motor symptoms (MDS-UPDRS) and cognitive performance (MoCA). We performed baseline genetic analysis in 718 families, of which 205 had sporadic early-onset PD (sEOPD), 113 had familial early-onset PD (fEOPD), and 400 had late-onset familial PD (fLOPD). 69 (9.6%) of these families carried pathogenic variants in known monogenic PD-related genes. The rate of a molecular diagnosis increased to 28.1% in PD with motor onset \u226435 years. We identified pathogenic variants in LRRK2 in 4.2% of families, and biallelic pathogenic variants in PRKN in 3.6% of families. We also identified two families with SNCA duplications and three families with a pathogenic repeat expansion in ATXN2, as well as single families with pathogenic variants in VCP, PINK1, PNPLA6, PLA2G6, SPG7, GCH1, and RAB32. An additional 73 (10.2%) families were carriers of at least one pathogenic or risk GBA1 variant. Most early-onset and familial PD cases do not have a known genetic cause, indicating that there are likely to be further monogenic causes for PD.",

    "abstract": "P21 activated kinase 6 (PAK6) is a serine-threonine kinase with physiological expression enriched in the brain and overexpressed in a number of human tumors. While the role of PAK6 in cancer cells has been extensively investigated, the physiological function of the kinase in the context of brain cells is poorly understood. Our previous work uncovered a link between PAK6 and the Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated kinase LRRK2, with PAK6 controlling LRRK2 activity and subcellular localization via phosphorylation of 14-3-3 proteins. Here, to gain more insights into PAK6 physiological function, we performed protein-protein interaction arrays and identified a subgroup of PAK6 binders related to ciliogenesis. We confirmed that endogenous PAK6 localizes at both the centrosome and the cilium, and positively regulates ciliogenesis not only in tumor cells but also in neurons and astrocytes. Notably, PAK6 rescues ciliogenesis and centrosomal cohesion defects associated with the G2019S but not the R1441C LRRK2 PD mutation. Since PAK6 binds LRRK2 via its GTPase/Roc-COR domain and the R1441C mutation is located in the Roc domain, we used microscale thermophoresis and AlphaFold2-based computational analysis to demonstrate that PD mutations in LRRK2 affecting the Roc-COR structure substantially decrease PAK6 affinity, providing a rationale for the differential protective effect of PAK6 toward the distinct forms of mutant LRRK2. Altogether, our study discloses a novel role of PAK6 in ciliogenesis and points to PAK6 as the first LRRK2 modifier with PD mutation-specificity.",

    "abstract": "Two themes are coming to the forefront in this decade: Cognitive impairment of an aging population and the quantum leap in developing artificial intelligence (AI). Both can be described as growing exponentially and presenting serious challenges. Although many questions have been addressed about the dangers of AI, we want to go beyond the fearful aspects of this topic and focus on the possible contribution of AI to solve the problem of chronic disorders of the elderly leading to cognitive impairment, like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Lewy body dementia. Our second goal is to look at the ways in which modern neuroscience can influence the future design of computers and the development of AI. We wish to honor the memory of Dr. John von Neumann, who came up with many breakthrough details of the first electronic computer. Remarkably, Dr. von Neumann dedicated his last book to the comparison of the human brain and the computer as it stood in those years of the mid-1950s. We will point out how his ideas are more relevant than ever in the age of supercomputers, AI and brain implants.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) is one of the most common iatrogenic movement disorders. It is characterized by tremors, slowness of movement, and shuffling gait with postural instability, clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Prior exposure to antipsychotic medications or other dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs) is required for the diagnosis.\nThis article aims to review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, ancillary testing, and treatment of DIP. A literature search was undertaken in PubMed from January 2013 to January 2024.\nA clinician's suspicion of DIP must always be present when a patient develops acute to subacute onset of parkinsonism while taking a DRBA. As DIP can be indistinguishable from idiopathic PD, ancillary testing, such as DaTscans and skin biopsy searching for alpha-synuclein deposits, are often required to make a definitive diagnosis. When DIP develops, steps should be made to discontinue the offending agent or, in the case of antipsychotics, dose reduction or change to an agent with lower risk for DIP, such as quetiapine or clozapine. Prophylactic treatment with anticholinergics is not indicated.",

    "abstract": "Non-invasive cell culture monitoring technology is crucial to improve the manufacturing efficiency of cell products. We have found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted into the culture supernatants in the differentiation process from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to dopaminergic progenitor cells, and that the composition of EVs changes in accordance with the differentiation processes. In this study, we hypothesized that it is possible to evaluate the cultured cellular states by detecting compositional changes of EVs secreted from cultured cells with label-free Raman spectroscopy in a non-invasive manner. Therefore, Raman signal analysis derived from EV fractions isolated from culture supernatants throughout the differentiation process was conducted. iPSCs cultures were simultaneously implemented under a standard condition (control) and an artificial deviation condition inducing reductions in pluripotency by depleting FGF2 in culture medium (-FGF2), which is indispensable for maintaining the pluripotency. Subsequently, the differentiation step was conducted for each iPSCs culture under the same condition. As a result, it was found that under -FGF2, the expression level of the pluripotency marker NANOG decreased compared to that of the control and correlated with the identification results based on Raman signals with a correlation coefficient of 0.77. Lipid-derived Raman signals were extracted as identification factors, suggesting that changes in the lipid component of EV occur depending on the cellular states. From the above, we have found that the change in composition of EVs in the culture supernatant by detecting Raman signals would be a monitoring index of the cellular state of differentiation and pluripotency.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with substantial impact on patients' quality of life. Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment for advanced PD, but patient responses vary, necessitating predictive models for personalized care. Recent advancements in medical imaging and machine learning offer opportunities to enhance predictive accuracy, particularly through deep learning and multi-instance learning (MIL) techniques. This retrospective study included 127 PD patients undergoing STN-DBS. Medical records and imaging data were collected, and patients were categorized based on treatment outcomes. Advanced segmentation models were trained for automated region of interest (ROI) delineation. A novel 2.5D deep learning approach incorporating multi-slice representation was developed to extract detailed ROI features. Multi-instance learning fusion techniques integrated predictions across multiple slices, combining radiomics and deep learning features to enhance model performance. Various machine learning algorithms were evaluated, and model robustness was assessed using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization. The MIL model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.846 for predicting STN-DBS outcomes, surpassing the radiomics model's AUC of 0.825. Integration of MIL and radiomics features in the DLRad model further improved discriminative ability to an AUC of 0.871. Calibration tests showed good model reliability, and decision curve analysis demonstrated clinical utility, affirming the model's predictive advantage. This study demonstrates the efficacy of integrating MIL, radiomics, and deep learning techniques to predict STN-DBS outcomes in PD patients. The multimodal fusion approach enhances predictive accuracy, supporting personalized treatment planning and advancing patient care.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is a common and debilitating side effect of chronic diseases, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. While physical exercise and psychological treatments have been shown to reduce fatigue, patients often struggle with adherence to these interventions in clinical practice. Game-based eHealth interventions are believed to address adherence issues by making the intervention more accessible and engaging.\nThis study aims to compile empirical evidence on game-based eHealth interventions for fatigue in individuals with chronic diseases and to evaluate their effectiveness in alleviating fatigue.\nA comprehensive literature search was performed across Embase, MEDLINE ALL, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar in August 2021. Study characteristics and outcomes from the included studies were extracted, and a random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to identify sources of heterogeneity.\nOf 1742 studies identified, 17 were included in the meta-analysis. These studies covered 5 different chronic diseases: multiple sclerosis (n=10), cancer (n=3), renal disease (n=2), stroke (n=1), and Parkinson disease (n=1). All but 1 study used exergaming interventions. The meta-analysis revealed a significant moderate effect size in reducing fatigue favoring the experimental interventions (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.65, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.21, P=.003) compared with control conditions consisting of conventional care and no care. However, heterogeneity was high (I2=85.87%). Subgroup analyses were conducted for the 2 most prevalent diseases. The effect size for the multiple sclerosis subgroup showed a trend in favor of eHealth interventions (SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.95 to 0.01, P=.05, I2=63.10%), but was not significant for the cancer group (SMD 0.61, 95% CI -0.36 to 1.58, P=.22). Balance exercises appeared particularly effective in reducing fatigue (SMD -1.19, 95% CI -1.95 to -0.42, P=.002).\nGame-based eHealth interventions appear effective in reducing fatigue in individuals with chronic diseases. Further research is needed to reinforce these findings and explore their impact on specific diseases. Additionally, there is a lack of investigation into interventions beyond exergaming within the field of game-based learning.",

    "abstract": "From 1990-2019, the burden of neurological disorders varied considerably across countries and regions. Psychiatric disorders, often emerging in early to mid-adulthood, are linked to late-life neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Individuals with conditions such as Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Schizophrenia, and Bipolar Disorder face up to four times higher risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders. Contrarily, 65\u202f% of those with neurodegenerative conditions experience severe psychiatric symptoms during their illness. Further, the limitation of medical resources continues to make this burden a significant global and local challenge. Therefore, brainwave entrainment provides therapeutic avenues for improving the symptoms of diseases. Brainwaves are rhythmic oscillations produced either spontaneously or in response to stimuli. Key brainwave patterns include gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta waves, yet the underlying physiological mechanisms and the brain's ability to shift between these dynamic states remain areas for further exploration. In neurological disorders, brainwaves are often disrupted, a phenomenon termed \"oscillopathy\". However, distinguishing these impaired oscillations from the natural variability in brainwave activity across different regions and functional states poses significant challenges. Brainwave-mediated therapeutics represents a promising research field aimed at correcting dysfunctional oscillations. Herein, we discuss a range of non-invasive techniques such as non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), neurologic music therapy (NMT), gamma stimulation, and somatosensory interventions using light, sound, and visual stimuli. These approaches, with their minimal side effects and cost-effectiveness, offer potential therapeutic benefits. When integrated, they may not only help in delaying disease progression but also contribute to the development of innovative medical devices for neurological care.",

    "abstract": "A heterozygous CGG repeat expansion in 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of GIPC1 is one of the causative factors of oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM), an adult-onset hereditary muscle disease characterized by progressive ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and facial, bulbar, and distal limb muscle weakness. CGG repeat expansion in GIPC1 has also been reported to be associated with Parkinson's disease, but these patients did not exhibit myopathic symptoms. We experienced two unrelated cases of oculopharyngeal type myopathy with CGG repeat expansion in GIPC1 presenting parkinsonism after exhibiting myopathic symptoms. Both cases showed p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in the skin, similar to those in NOTCH2NLC-related disorders. Our cases suggest that GIPC1-related repeat expansions may be associated with a broad spectrum and tissue-differential neuromuscular manifestations, indicating a common mechanism between OPDM2 and other CGG-repeat expansion diseases. It is important to note OPDM2 patients' central neurological symptoms, as myopathic symptoms may obscure central nervous system manifestations.",

    "abstract": "Walking and balance impairments, represented by freezing of gait and falls, are significant contributors to disability in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, the composite measure of the Walking and Balance Milestone (WBMS) has not been thoroughly investigated.\nThis study included 606 early-stage PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, with a disease duration of less than 2 years and no WBMS at baseline. Patients were divided into a model development cohort (70\u00a0%) and a validation cohort (30\u00a0%) according to the enrollment site. Longitudinal follow-up data over a period of 12 years were analyzed.\nAmong all 606 patients, the estimated probability of being WBMS-free at the 5th and 10th year was 88\u00a0% and 60\u00a0%, respectively. Five clinical variables (Age, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) score, Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part I (MDS-UPDRS-I) score, and REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) were used to construct the Cox predictive model. The C-index of the model was 0.75 in the development cohort and 0.76 in the validation cohort. By optimizing the PIGD and MDS-UPDRS-I variables, an easy-to-use model was achieved with comparable predictive performance.\nA predictive model based on five baseline clinical measures (Age, SDMT, PIGD score, MDS-UPDRS-I score, RBD) could effectively estimate the risk of the WBMS in early PD patients. This model is valuable for prognostic counseling and clinical intervention trials for gait and balance impairment.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests an inverse correlation between smoking and Parkinson's disease (PD), yet the mechanisms remain unclear. This study examines the changing risk relationship between smoking and PD diagnosis using alcohol consumption, another reward-driven behavior, as a comparative measure.\nA nested case-control study was conducted using the UK Biobank (UKBB) database. Participants in the prediagnostic phase of PD were identified, and self-reported data on tobacco and alcohol use were analyzed employing conditional binary logistic regression. Polynomial and piece-wise regression models were employed to discern shifting associations with PD over time.\nOf 502,304 participants (63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3 years, 63\u00a0% male), 3049 prediagnostic PD cases were identified. Non-smokers had a heightened PD risk, and this association strengthened closer to diagnosis. The odds ratio (OR [95 % CI]) associated with PD in non-smokers was 2.02 [1.07-3.81] 1-4 years before diagnosis, compared to 1.36 [1.02-1.83] at >10-year intervals (linear trend, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012). The time trajectory of ORs was best depicted by a quadratic function, identifying a shift in risk 7.5 years before diagnosis documentation. Similar patterns emerged among alcohol non-consumers, with an 8.5-year interval inflection point.\nThis study identified two disparate risk trajectories among non-smokers: an initial low-amplitude increased risk at prolonged prediagnostic intervals possibly related to genetic/personality factors, followed by a sharp escalation in risk association commencing 7-8 years before diagnosis, possibly propelled by reverse causality. Similar trends in alcohol consumption reinforce these conclusions. These findings could suggest that smoking cessation may serve as an early indicator of PD.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) takes an increasingly prominent role in health care, a growing body of research is being dedicated to its application in the investigation of communication sciences and disorders (CSD). This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview, serving as a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and professionals seeking to comprehend the evolving landscape of AI in CSD research.\nWe conducted a bibliometric analysis of AI-based research in the discipline of CSD published up to December 2023. Utilizing the Web of Science and Scopus databases, we identified 15,035 publications, with 4,375 meeting our inclusion criteria. Based on the bibliometric data, we examined publication trends and patterns, characteristics of research activities, and research hotspot tendencies.\nFrom 1985 onwards, there has been a consistent annual increase in publications, averaging 16.51%, notably surging from 2012 to 2023. The primary communication disorders studied include autism, aphasia, dysarthria, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Noteworthy AI models instantiated in CSD research encompass support vector machine, convolutional neural network, and hidden Markov model, among others.\nCompared to AI applications in other fields, the adoption of AI in CSD has lagged slightly behind. While CSD studies primarily use classical machine learning techniques, there is a growing trend toward the integration of deep learning methods. AI technology offers significant benefits for both research and clinical practice in CSD, but it also presents certain challenges. Moving forward, collaboration among technological, research, and clinical domains is essential to empower researchers and speech-language pathologists to effectively leverage AI technology for the study, diagnosis, assessment, and rehabilitation of CSD.\nhttps://doi.org/10.23641/asha.27162564.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is a common diabetic complication associated with excess morbidity and mortality. CAN is also seen in conditions such as Parkinson's disease. Normative reference data for cardiovascular autonomic function are used to stratify individuals into those with and without CAN. However, reference thresholds for both cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs) and heart rate variability (HRV) are scarce and based on small sample sizes. The aim of the study was to establish contemporary normative reference thresholds based on a large non-diabetic population free of cardiovascular disease (CVD).\nCardiovascular autonomic function, CARTs and 5-min HRV indices were assessed in individuals without diabetes and CVD from the Lolland-Falster Health Study (2018-2020) by applying the point-of-care device Vagus\u2122. Age-specific normative reference thresholds were estimated by using log-transformed quantile regression models at the 5th and 10th percentile, with adjustments made for sex. Models assessing the association between age and HRV indices were further adjusted for heart rate.\nWe present age-specific normative reference thresholds for cardiovascular autonomic function, including CARTs and HRV, for 875 individuals (48% females) aged 15-85\u00a0years. The reference thresholds are presented for both the 5th and 10th lower percentile. Higher age was inversely associated with all outcomes. Females tended to have a higher parasympathetic drive compared to males. Pre-test conditions did not affect CARTs significantly.\nThe presented age-related normative reference thresholds for both CARTs and HRV indices based on a large Danish cohort may facilitate improved quality of research and treatment.",

The diverse needs arising from these symptoms make a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach crucial for effective management. This article explores the role and benefits of MDTs in Parkinson's care, highlighting how collaborative models improve clinical outcomes and quality of life. MDTs integrate neurologists, nurse specialists, therapists, and other professionals to deliver comprehensive, patient-centered care. The inclusion of patients and caregivers fosters shared decision-making, enhancing health outcomes. However, challenges like limited controlled trials, lack of comprehensive guidelines, and under-referral remain. Innovative models, such as telehealth and community-based care, offer promising solutions, especially in underserved regions. The article advocates for further research and standardized guidelines to optimize the MDT approach for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is one of the rapidly spreading cancers, with its potent malignancy often linked to pronounced angiogenesis within tumors. To mitigate this vascularization profile, bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae), a monoclonal antibody, has been utilized for its antiangiogenic activity. However, its effectiveness is hindered by challenges in crossing the blood-brain barrier and the risk of off-target organ toxicity. Delivering drugs directly from the nose to the brain through the olfactory or trigeminal nerves bypassing the blood-brain barrier offers enhanced bioavailability and a more precise targeting strategy. To overcome these challenges, we aimed to develop bevacizumab in situ gel loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles for intranasal delivery and further examine their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. The intranasal gel of mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with bevacizumab was optimized and formulated using a factorial and quality by design approach. In the case of bevacizumab mesoporous silica nanoparticles, lower particle size and most negative zeta potential were selected as quality target product profiles which is important for drug loading on the mesoporous silica nanoparticles and also transport of these nanoparticles across the nasal mucosa to the brain. A design space with a multidimensional combination of input variables and process parameters has been demonstrated to assure quality. To optimize the design space and achieve the desired quality standards, the base catalyst and surfactant concentration were chosen as the critical process parameters, while particle size and zeta potential were identified as the critical quality attributes. The novel formulation was assessed for physicochemical parameters such as particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, appearance, color, consistency, and pH. Additionally, studies on in vitro release, ex vivo permeation, stability, nasal toxicity, organ safety, and bioavailability were conducted. The efficacy study was conducted in an orthotopic murine glioblastoma rat model in which C6 Luc cells were instilled in the striatum of the rat's brain. In vivo, bioluminescence imaging of brain tumors was carried out to observe the tumor regression after treatment with the intranasal and intravenous bevacizumab formulation. Biochemical parameters and histopathology were performed for organ safety studies. The optimized intranasal formulation exhibited an average particle size of 318.8\u00a0nm and a zeta potential of\u2009-\u200914.7\u00a0mV for the mesoporous silica nanoparticles. The formulation also demonstrated an entrapment efficiency of 91.34% and a loading capacity of 45.67%. Further pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the optimized intranasal bevacizumab formulation achieved a significantly higher brain concentration Cmax\u2009=\u2009147.9\u00a0ng/ml, indicating improved bioavailability compared to rats administered with intravenous bevacizumab formulation (BEVATAS\u00ae), which had a Cmax of 127.2\u00a0ng/ml. Moreover, this nanoparticle formulation entirely mitigated systemic exposure to bevacizumab. Organ safety evaluation of different biochemical parameters and histopathological analyses revealed that the intranasal bevacizumab-treated group was showing less off-target organ toxicity compared to the group treated with intravenous bevacizumab formulation. Subsequently, the efficacy of this nanosystem was evaluated in an orthotopic glioblastoma rat model, monitoring tumor growth over time through in vivo bioluminescence imaging and assessing anti-angiogenic effects. Twenty-one days post-induction, mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with bevacizumab in situ gel exhibited a marked reduction in average bioluminescence radiance (4.39\u2009\u00d7\u200910",

    "abstract": "High-intensity physical activity is a non-pharmacological intervention that has been tested as a treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of the study was to investigate the benefits of high-intensity physical exercise on the number of neurons and astrocytes in a a rat model of Parkinson's disease submitted to training before and after the inducing injury. Seventy Wistar rats were used, distributed as follows: nine rats trained before PD induction (DP-Exa), nine trained after PD induction (DP-Exd), 10 trained before and after PD induction (DP-Exad), and nine sedentary rats (DP-Sed). There were also the same groups but with the rats exposed to the sham surgery (control). High-intensity physical exercise on a vertical ladder was performed before and/or after PD induction for 5 days/week, 30-45 min a day, for 4 weeks. PD was induced with an electrolytic lesion (AP -4.9, ML 1.7, and DV 8.1). At the end of the experiment, the brain was removed for Nissl staining and immunohistochemistry of glial fibrillary acidid protein (GFAP) in the substantia nigra and striatum. The DP-Exa, Sham-Exa, DP-Exad, and Sham-Exad groups showed a greater number of neurons and higher expression of GFAP in the substantia nigra and stiatum compared with the the DP-Exd, Sham-Exd, DP-Sed, and Sham-Sed groups. Thus, rats that performed high-intensity training before or before and after PD induction had higher densities of neurons and astrocytes.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the association between cognitive function and facial emotion recognition (FER) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). We enrolled 126 participants from Taiwan, including 63 patients with idiopathic PD and 63 matched healthy controls. The PD group was divided into two groups: those with normal cognitive function (PD-NC) and those with MCI (PD-MCI). Participants underwent a modality emotion recognition test and comprehensive cognitive assessment. Our findings reveal that patients with PD-MCI exhibit significantly impaired FER, especially in recognizing \"disgust,\" compared with patients with PD-NC and healthy adults (p = .001). This deficit correlates with executive function, attention, memory, and visuospatial abilities. Attention mediates the relationship between executive function and \"disgust\" FER. The findings highlight how patients with PD-MCI are specifically challenged when recognizing \"disgust\" and suggest that cognitive training focusing on cognitive flexibility and attention may improve their FER abilities. This study contributes to our understanding of the nuanced relationship between cognitive dysfunction and FER in patients with PD-MCI, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions.",

    "abstract": "Long-term longitudinal data on outcomes in sporadic Parkinson's Disease are limited, especially from cohorts with extensive biological characterization. Recent advances in biomarkers characterization of Parkinson's Disease necessitate an updated examination of long-term progression within contemporary cohorts like the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, which enrolled individuals within 2 years of clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease. Our study leverages the Neuronal Synuclein Disease framework, which defines the disease based on biomarker assessed presence of neuronal alpha-synuclein and dopamine deficit, rather than based on conventional clinical diagnostic criteria. In this study we aimed to provide a comprehensive long-term description of disease progression using the integrated biological and clinical staging system framework. We analyzed data from 344 participants from the sporadic Parkinson's Disease cohort in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, who met Neuronal Synuclein Disease criteria. We assessed 11-year progression in a spectrum of clinical measures. We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association between baseline stage and time to key outcomes, including survival, postural instability (Hoehn & Yahr \u2265 3), loss of independence (Schwab & England < 80%), cognitive decline, and domain-based milestones such as walking and balance, motor complications, autonomic dysfunction, and activities of daily living. Additional analyses were completed to account for death and participant dropout. Biomarker analysis included dopamine transporter binding measures, as well as serum urate, neurofilament light chain and CSF amyloid-beta, phosphorylated tau and total tau. At baseline, despite the cohort consisting of individuals within 2 years of clinical diagnosis, there was clear separation of participants in Neuronal Synuclein Disease Stages (23% Stage 2b, 67% Stage 3, 10% Stage 4). At 11 years, data were available for 153 participants; 35 participants had died over the follow up period. Of retained participants, 59% presented normal cognition, 24% had evidence of postural instability and mean Schwab & England score was 78.5. Serum neurofilament light chain consistently increased over time. No other biofluids had a consistent change in trajectory. Of importance, baseline Neuronal Synuclein Disease Stage predicted progression to clinically meaningful milestones. This study provides data on longitudinal, 11-year progression in Neuronal Synuclein Disease participants within 2 years of clinical diagnosis. We observed better long-term outcomes in this contemporary observational study cohort. It highlights the heterogeneity in the early Parkinson's Disease population as defined by clinical diagnostic criteria and underscores the importance of shifting from clinical to biologically and functionally based inclusion criteria in the design of new clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia are involved in motor control and action selection, and their impairment manifests in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia, among others. The complex neuronal circuitry of the basal ganglia is located deep inside the brain and presents significant treatment challenges. Conventional treatment strategies, such as invasive surgeries and medications, may have limited effectiveness and may result in considerable side effects. Non-invasive ultrasound (US) treatment approaches are becoming increasingly recognized for their therapeutic potential for reversibly permeabilizing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), targeting therapeutic delivery deep into the brain, and neuromodulation. Studies conducted on animals and early clinical trials using ultrasound as a therapeutic modality have demonstrated promising outcomes for controlling symptom severity while preserving neural tissue. These results could improve the quality of life for patients living with basal ganglia impairments. This review article explores the therapeutic frontiers of ultrasound technology, describing the brain mechanisms that are triggered and engaged by ultrasound. We demonstrate that this cutting-edge method could transform the way neurological disorders associated with the basal ganglia are managed, opening the door to less invasive and more effective treatments.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the aggravation of aging, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing year by year, and the prognosis of patients is poor. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a new and non-invasive neuroimaging technology, which has been gradually deepened in the application research of neurodegenerative diseases by virtue of its unique neurooxygen signal brain functional imaging characteristics in monitoring the disease condition, making treatment plans and evaluating the treatment effect. In this paper, the mechanism of action and technical characteristics of fNIRS are briefly introduced, and the application research of fNIRS in different neurodegenerative diseases is summarized in order to provide new ideas for future related research and clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) integrate multiple external inputs to shape motor output. In addition, MSNs form local inhibitory synaptic connections with one another. The function of striatal lateral inhibition is unknown, but one possibility is in selecting an intended action while suppressing alternatives. Action selection is disrupted in several movement disorders, including levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), a complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy characterized by involuntary movements. Here, we identify chronic changes in the strength of striatal lateral inhibitory synapses in a mouse model of PD/LID. These synapses are also modulated by acute dopamine signaling. Chemogenetic suppression of lateral inhibition originating from dopamine D2 receptor-expressing MSNs lowers the threshold to develop involuntary movements ",

    "abstract": "To present a novel method for removing stimulus transient that exploits the absolute refractory period of electrically excitable neural tissues.\nElectrical stimulation often generates significant signal artifacts that can obscure important physiological signals. Removal of the artifact and understanding latent information from these signals could provide objective measures of circuit engagement, potentially driving advancements in neuromodulation research and therapies.\nWe conducted intracranial physiology studies on five consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery as part of their routine care. Monopolar stimuli (either cathodic or anodic) were delivered in pairs through the DBS electrode across a range of inter-stimulus intervals. Recordings from adjacent unused electrode contacts used broadband sampling and precise synchronization to generate a robust template for the stimulus transient during the absolute refractory period. These templates of stimulus transient were then subtracted from recordings at different intervals to extract and analyze the residual neural potentials.\nAfter artifact removal, the residual signals exhibited absolute and relative refractory periods with timing indicative of neural activity. Cathodic and anodic DBS pulses generated distinct patterns of local tissue activation, showing phase independence from the prior stimulus. The earliest detectable neural responses occurred at short peak latencies (ranging from 0.19 to 0.38 ms post-stimulus) and were completely or partially obscured by the stimulus artifact prior to removal. Cathodic stimuli produced stronger local tissue responses than anodic stimuli, aligning with clinical observations of lower activation thresholds for cathodic stimulation. However, cathodic and anodic pulses induced artifact patterns that were equivalent but opposite.\nThe proposed artifact removal technique enhances prior approaches by allowing direct measurement of local tissue responses without requirements for stimulus polarity reversal, template scaling, or specialized filters. This approach could be integrated into future neuromodulation systems to visualize stimulus-evoked neural potentials that would otherwise be obscured by stimulus artifacts.",

    "abstract": "Epitranscriptomic modifications modulate diverse biological processes, such as regulation of gene expression, abundance, location and function. In particular, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation has been shown to regulate various disease processes, including cancer and inflammation. While there is evidence that m6A modification is functionally relevant in neural development and differentiation, the role of m6A modification in HIV neuropathogenesis is unknown. Here, we identified direct m6A modifications in miRNAs from BG tissues of Rhesus Monkeys (RMs) that were either vehicle-treated uninfected (VEH), SIV-infected combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) treated (VEH/SIV/cART), or THC:CBD treated VEH/SIV/cART (THC:CBD/SIV/cART) RMs. We detected m6A modifications across all BG tissues. SIV infection promoted an overall hypomethylated m6A profile. While the overall hypomethylated m6A profile was not significantly impacted by THC:CBD treatment, specific miRNAs, particularly those predicted to target proinflammatory genes showed markedly reduced m6A methylation levels compared to the VEH treated RMs. Additionally, we found that specific BG tissue miRNAs bearing m6A epi-transcriptomic marks were also transferred to BG-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Mechanistically, we identified the DRACH motif of the seed region of miR-194-5p to be significantly m6A hypomethylated, which was predicted to directly target STAT1, an important interferon-activated transcription factor known to drive neuroinflammation, in diseases ranging from Alzheimer to Parkinson and Huntington disease. Notably, THC:CBD treatments significantly reduced m6A methylation of 43 miRNA species directly involved in regulating CNS network genes, thus providing a possible mechanist explanation on the beneficial effects of THC:CBD treatments noted in several disease involving neuroinflammation. Our findings also underscore the need for investigating the qualitative, posttranscriptional modification changes in the RNA profiles along with the more traditional, qualitative alterations in pathological conditions or after various treatment regimens.",

However, the neural mechanism behind this remains unclear.\nThis cohort study explores changes in motor function, brain activation, and functional connectivity following 2 weeks of rehabilitation in TD-PD and NTD-PD patients, respectively. A total of 11 TD-PD patients, 24 NTD-PD patients, and 21 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were included. At baseline, all participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing the foot tapping task. Motor symptoms, gait, balance, and task-based fMRI were then evaluated in patients before and after rehabilitation.\nCompared to HCs, TD-PD patients showed increased activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus and the right insula, and NTD-PD patients showed increased activations in the left postcentral gyrus and decreased within-cerebellar connectivity at baseline. Rehabilitation improved motor function in PD patients regardless of motor subtype. TD-PD patients showed increased recruitments of the sensorimotor cortex and the bilateral thalamus after rehabilitation, and NTD-PD patients showed increased cerebellar activation and within-cerebellar connectivity that was associated with better motor performance.\nThis study demonstrated that rehabilitation-induced brain functional reorganization varied by motor subtypes in PD, which may have important implications for making individualized rehabilitation programs.\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: ChiCTR1900020771.",

    "abstract": "A small, translucent nematode known as Caenorhabditis elegans, or C. elegans, is frequently utilized as a model organism in biomedical studies. These worms, which are around 1 mm long and feed on bacteria, are usually found in soil. For accessible and effective research on genetics, developmental biology, neuroscience, cell biology, and aging, C. elegans provide an ideal model. Its simplicity, which includes a translucent body and a nervous system with only 302 neurons, makes it possible to see cellular and developmental processes in great detail. Because of its special benefits, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans allows for a thorough characterization of the cellular and molecular processes causing age-related neurodegenerative diseases. This is a general review of the life cycle, experimental methodologies, and the use of C. elegans to model brain diseases, including those related to molecular and genetic factors that cause neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we go over how C. elegans is a perfect model organism for studying neurons in instances of prevalent age-related neurodegenerative illnesses due to a combination of its biological traits and new analytical techniques. The literature review process was carried out step-by-step using online search databases such as Web of Science, PubMED, Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, and Google Patents. In the first searches, keywords like C.elegans, disease modelling, and neuroprotective activity were employed. Because of C. elegans's physiological transparency, it is possible to track the development of neurodegeneration in aging organisms by using co-expressed fluorescent proteins. Importantly, a fully characterized connectome provides a unique ability to precisely connect cellular death with behavioural instability or phenotypic diversity in vivo, thus permitting a deep knowledge of the detrimental effect of neurodegeneration on wellbeing. In addition, pharmacological therapies and both forward and reverse gene screening speed up the discovery of modifiers that change neurodegeneration. These chemical-genetic investigations work together to determine important threshold states that either increase or decrease cellular stress in order to unravel related pathways.",

    "abstract": "In today's time, a diversity of neurodegenerative diseases that widely affect the CNS causing insufficiency in particular brain processes such as memory, mobility, and cognition due to the moderate loss of CNS neurons. This review emphasizes different phytochemical constituents used widely for the prevention or treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkin-son's disease (PD). Berberin (BBR), which is an isoquinoline class of alkaloid and isolated from the plant Hydrastis condenses and Berberis aaristata, has both acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibiting properties as well as monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibiting properties involved in the betterment of AD by decreasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Like BBR, Physostigmine, isolated from the Physostigma venenosum / Calabar bean and belongs to the family Leguminosae, and Morphine, isolated from the plant Papaver somniferum / Opium poppy or Breadseed poppy, also has a significant impact on the management and treatment of AD and PD by reducing both neuroinflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokines production. Morphine bineurodegenerative diseases with \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR) in CNS elevate GABA levels in the synaptic cleft of the brain and reduces the neurotoxicity via stimulation of MOR. It has been discovered that physostigmine improves cognitive function in AD patients and reduces \u03b1-synu-clein expression in PD neural cell lines. Isorhyncophylline (IRN) is a Chinese herbal medicine isolated from the plant Uncaria rhyncophylla which provides neuroprotective efficiency against neurotoxicity that occurs by amyloid \u03b2 (the main component of amyloid plaques) found in the brain of people with AD.",

    "abstract": "Elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are linked to dementia risk, and conversely, increased plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein-A1 (Apo-A1) associate with decreased dementia risk. Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) meaningfully affects the concentrations of these blood lipids and may therefore provide an opportunity to treat dementia.\nDrug target Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to anticipate the on-target effects of lower CETP concentration (\u03bcg/mL) on plasma lipids, cardiovascular disease outcomes, autopsy confirmed Lewy body dementia (LBD), as well as Parkinson's dementia.\nMR analysis of lower CETP concentration recapitulated the blood lipid effects observed in clinical trials of CETP-inhibitors, as well as protective effects on coronary heart disease (odds ratio (OR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89; 0.96), heart failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, any stroke, ischemic stroke, and small vessel stroke (0.90, 95%CI 0.85; 0.96). Consideration of dementia related traits indicated that lower CETP concentrations were associated higher total brain volume (0.04 per standard deviation, 95%CI 0.02; 0.06), lower risk of LBD (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.74; 0.89) and Parkinson's dementia risk (OR 0.26, 95%CI 0.14; 0.48). APOE4 stratified analyses suggested the LBD effect was most pronounced in APOE-\u03b54\u2009+\u2009participants (OR 0.61 95%CI 0.51; 0.73), compared to APOE-\u03b54- (OR 0.89 95%CI 0.79; 1.01); interaction p-value 5.81\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nThese results suggest that inhibition of CETP may be a viable strategy to treat dementia, with a more pronounced effect expected in APOE-\u03b54 carriers.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by neuronal degradation, dysfunction, or death within the CNS. Oxidative and inflammatory stress play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. The interplay between these stressors and dysregulated cellular signaling pathways contributes to neurodegeneration. Downregulation of NRF-2 compromises antioxidant defense, exacerbating neuronal damage, while increased TLR-4/MAPK and TLR-4/NF-\u03baB signaling promotes neuroinflammation. Excessive ROS production by NADPH oxidase leads to oxidative damage and neuronal apoptosis. The strategies targeting NRF-2, TLR-4-mediated inflammatory stress, and NADPH oxidase activity promise to mitigate neuronal damage and halt the progression of the disease. Kaempferol is a flavonoid polyphenol antioxidant found abundantly in various fruits and vegetables, including apples, grapes, tomatoes, and broccoli. It is widely found in medicinal plants including Equisetum spp., Sophora japonica, Ginkgo biloba, and Euphorbia pekinensis (Rupr.). A substantial body of in vitro and in vivo evidences have demonstrated the neuroprotective potential of kaempferol against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Kaempferol demonstrates multifaceted potential in mitigating neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in different neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of various pathways including NRF-2, NADPH oxidase, TLR-4/MAPK, and TLR-4/NF-\u03baB. This review article was developed through a comprehensive analysis and interpretation of research published between 2009 and 2024, sourced from multiple scientific databases, including PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. This review aims to provide an in-depth overview of the neuroprotective effects of kaempferol, focusing on its underlying molecular mechanisms. A total of 24 research evidence were included to elucidate the molecular pathways by which kaempferol exerts its protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains elusive, and the limited availability of suitable animal models hampers research on pathogenesis and drug development. We report the development of a cynomolgus monkey model of PD that combines adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of \u03b1-synuclein into the substantia nigra with an injection of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) into the striatum. Our results show that pathological processes were accelerated, including dopaminergic neuron degeneration, Lewy body aggregation, and hallmarks of inflammation in microglia and astrocytes. Behavioral phenotypes, dopamine transporter imaging, and transcriptomic profiling further demonstrate consistencies between the model and patients with PD. This model can help to determine the mechanisms underlying PD impacted by \u03b1-synuclein and PAR and aid in the accelerated development of therapeutic strategies for PD.",

    "abstract": "The brain's lymphatic system is comprised of a glymphatic-meningeal-cervical lymphatic vessel pathway. The study of its mechanism and pathophysiology in neurodegenerative disease has been one of the most exciting topics in basic and translational neuroscience of the last decade. However, while there has been some debate about when the meningeal lymphatics were discovered, it cannot be denied that studies in preclinical models and humans in this century represent a monumental step forward in our understanding of how the brain removes metabolic waste, the role this system plays in neurodegenerative disease, and, most importantly, its potential as a novel therapeutic target. This is a summary of the history, functional anatomy, and role of the brain's lymphatics in neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) has been shown to be involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) progression, but its mechanism needs to be further explored.\nMice were injected with 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce PD mice models, and BV2 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to mimic PD cell models. MALAT1 expression and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) protein level were examined using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. Cell functions were tested by cell counting kit 8 assay and flow cytometry. The interaction between MALAT1 and SOCS3 was confirmed using RNA pull-down and RIP assays.\nMALAT1 was upregulated in MPTP-induced PD mice and LPS-induced BV2 cells. Silencing of MALAT1 increased viability, while inhibited apoptosis and inflammation in LPS-induced BV2 cells. Besides, MALAT1 enhanced the SOCS3 promoter methylation to decrease its expression by recruiting DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B. Furthermore, SOCS3 knockdown eliminated sh-MALAT1-mediated the inhibition effect on LPS-induced BV2 cell injury. In vivo, MALAT1 silencing ameliorated neurological impairment and neuroinflammation in MPTP-induced PD mice.\nOur data revealed that MALAT1 worsened PD processes via inhibiting SOCS3 expression by increasing its promoter methylation.",

    "abstract": "Paraquat (PQ), a commonly used herbicide, is a potent environmental neurotoxin associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). While the involvement of various brain cell types in the etiology of each disorder is well recognized, the specific cell subtypes implicated in the comorbidity of PD and MDD, especially under PQ neurotoxicity, remain poorly understood. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze brain tissues from mice with PQ-induced PD with MDD. By integrating genomic data with scRNA-seq profiles, we identified differences in cellular heterogeneity related to the pathogenesis of PD and MDD under PQ exposure. Our analysis of risk enrichment in genes with cell type-specific expression patterns revealed that astrocytes are predominantly linked to the comorbidity of PQ-induced PD and MDD. Furthermore, we identified a specific astrocyte subtype that plays a major role in the comorbidity-related changes observed in PQ-induced PD and MDD. This subtype appears to interact with and potentially transform into MDD-specific and PD-specific subtypes. Additionally, pathways related to chemical synaptic function and neuro-projection development were involved in all key stages of PD and MDD co-occurrence. We also identified RNF7 and MTCH2 as shared diagnostic hub genes for PD and MDD, which changed significantly in astrocytes following PQ exposure. These genes may serve as potential markers for astrocyte-specific prognostic diagnosis of PQ-induced PD with MDD. In summary, this study provides the first scRNA-seq profile of comorbidity in a PQ-exposed model. It highlights the heterogeneity of astrocytes in comorbidity and elucidates potential mechanisms underlying the co-occurrence of PD and MDD. These findings emphasize the need for further research into the pathogenesis of PD comorbid with MDD and offer novel insights into PQ neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Microcystins are environmental toxins produced by freshwater cyanobacteria. Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is one of the most abundant and harmful isomers. MC-LR poses a serious threat to human health. MC-LR could penetrate the blood-brain barrier of mice and accumulate in the substantia nigra (SN) of the midbrain, leading to a reduction in dopamine levels and Parkinson's disease (PD)-like motor dysfunction in mice. The reduction in dopamine levels is a key factor contributing to movement disorders in humans with PD. Dopamine is synthesized in the dopaminergic neurons of the SN by the actions of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase (DDC). In this study, we found that MC-LR could enter dopaminergic neurons in the SN and directly bound to extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), enhancing ERK2 stability. ERK2 further enhanced the transcriptional activity of Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 8 (HSPA8) and promoted the expression of Heat shock cognate 71\u00a0kDa protein (HSC70), which in turn amplified the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) pathway and accelerated the degradation of TH and DDC. This affected the dopamine synthesis process, resulting in a significant reduction in dopamine levels. The study is the first to reveal that ERK2 was a direct target of MC-LR, and further enhanced CMA affecting dopamine synthesis, which has important theoretical and practical significance for environmental safety management.",

    "abstract": "PD is one of the neurodegenerative illnesses affects 1-2 individuals per 1000 people over the age of 60 and has a 1\u202f% prevalence rate. It affects both the non-motor and motor aspects of movement, including initiation, execution, and planning. Prior to behavioral and cognitive abnormalities like dementia, movement-related symptoms including stiffness, tremor, and initiation issues may be observed. Patients with PD have substantial reductions in social interactions, quality of life (QoL), and familial ties, as well as significant financial burdens on both the individual and societal levels. The healthcare industry is mostly using ML approaches with the modalities like image, signal, and data as well. Therefore, this survey aims to conduct a review of 50 articles on Parkinson disease diagnosis using different modalities. The survey includes (i) Classifying multimodal articles on Parkinson disease diagnosis (image, signal, data) using various machine learning, deep learning, and other approaches. (ii) Analyzing different datasets, simulation tools used in the existing papers. (iii)Examining certain performance measures, assessing the best performance, and chronological review of reviewed paper. Finally, the review determines the research gaps and obstacles in this research topic.",

    "abstract": "Aging, an inevitable physiological process leading to a progressive decline in bodily functions, has been an abundantly researched domain with studies attempting to slow it down and reduce its debilitating effects. Investigations into the cellular and molecular pathways associated with aging have allowed the formulation of therapeutic strategies. Of these, caloric restriction (CR) has been implicated for its role in promoting healthy aging by modulating key molecular targets like Insulin/IGF-1, mTOR, and sirtuins. However, CR requires dedication and commitment to a strict regimen which poses a difficulty in maintaining consistency. To maneuver around cumbersome diets, Caloric Restriction Mimetics (CRMs) have emerged as promising alternatives by mimicking the beneficial effects of CR. This review elucidates the molecular foundations enabling CRMs like rapamycin, metformin, resveratrol, spermidine, and many more to function as suitable anti-aging molecules. Moreover, it explores clinical trials (retrieved from the clinicaltrials.gov database) aimed at demonstrating the efficacy of CRMs as effective candidates against age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The behavior of hydration water around familial Parkinson's disease linked mutants of \u03b1-synuclein may be linked to the early-onset of Parkinson's disease. For the first time, this study compares the local structure and dynamics of hydration water around different segments of some of the natural mutants of \u03b1-synuclein, i.e., E46K, G51D, A30P, and A53E, with that of the wild-type protein through explicit water MD simulations. The results show that the C-terminal segments of the fast aggregating mutants such as E46K and A30P are less exposed to water, while those of the slow aggregating ones such as A53E and G51D are more exposed to water relative to that of the wild-type protein. In addition, the water molecules are found to be more ordered around the C-terminal segment of the A53E and G51D mutants as compared to the wild-type protein. This is due to an increase in the overall charge of \u03b1-syn upon A53E and G51D mutations. The translational and rotational motions of water molecules in the hydration shell of the C-terminal segment of A53E and G51D mutants are found to be faster relative to that of the wild-type protein. This study validates the differential hydration environment around the C-terminal segment for the causative and protective mutants of \u03b1-synuclein.",

    "abstract": "The close connection between the brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) that are enclosed within this barrier is the result of an intracellular junction, which is responsible for the constricted connection. The regulation and control of drug delivery systems both require nanoparticles, which are extremely small particles made up of a variety of materials, including polymers, metals, and other chemicals. Nanoparticles are a crucial component of the regulation and control of drug delivery systems. There is a possibility that nanomaterials composed of inorganic chemicals, such as gold nanoparticles, could be utilized in the treatment of neurodegenerative illnesses like Parkinson's disease. In addition to this, they are used as nano-carriers for the aim of distributing drugs to the region of the brain that is being targeted. There are a number of advantages that are easily apparent when compared to other methods of administering drugs for neurological diseases. The current review demonstrates both the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing a wide variety of nanomaterials for brain delivery, as well as the potential impact that this will have in the future on the safety and effectiveness of patient care.",

    "abstract": "Brain-related Neurodegenerative Disorders (NDD) are the leading cause of low life expectancy globally. Brain-targeted drug delivery is required for treating most the NDD via bypassing the blood-brain barrier, and hepatic first-pass metabolism. The nasal-brain drug delivery route has the advantage of locally enhancing drug delivery to the brain, mainly through the olfactory route rather than systemic circulation. To overcome the limitations of nasal-brain drug delivery, a nanocarrier approach and mucoadhesive polymers are needed. Notwithstanding these constraints, various nanotechnology techniques have been created, including polymeric micelles, liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, & nano-emulsions. This review aims to explore the intranasal pathway for drug delivery through the nasal-brain lymphatic systems, considering brain anatomy and physiology along with a drug formulation design approach.",

    "abstract": "The inferior vena cava (IVC) is a critical structure for venous return to the heart, and congenital anomalies of the IVC, though rare, can have significant clinical implications during procedures like catheter ablation for arrhythmias. In this case, a 26-year-old male presented with left-sided chest pressure after a routine exercise. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed a delta wave and shortened PR interval, consistent with Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, which involves an accessory electrical pathway leading to supraventricular tachycardia. Catheter ablation was planned to treat WPW syndrome; however, during the procedure, access to the right atrium via the IVC was obstructed due to an undiagnosed congenital IVC anomaly. Imaging revealed that the IVC was interrupted at the abdominal level, with venous return rerouted through an enlarged azygos vein into the superior vena cava. This anomaly prevented the use of the standard transvenous approach for ablation, and alternative approaches requiring specialized equipment and a highly skilled team available only at a tertiary care center were necessary. The patient was subsequently referred to such a center for further management. The IVC anomaly directly affected the procedural outcome, making pre-procedural imaging important when unexpected difficulties arise during ablation for WPW. This case demonstrates how congenital vascular anomalies may complicate standard electrophysiological procedures, especially in arrhythmia management. Future research should focus on developing alternative ablation techniques, such as the aortic approach, which may offer solutions for patients with vascular anomalies but require specialized facilities. While routine imaging for all WPW patients is not necessary, this case suggests that early imaging should be considered when procedural access is unexpectedly difficult. Establishing protocols and training for these complex scenarios is important for improving outcomes in similar cases.",

    "abstract": "It is established that one of the best predictors of a future diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is a current diagnosis of rapid eye movement behaviour disorder (RBD). In such patients, this provides a unique opportunity to study brain physiology and behavioural motor features of RBD that may precede early-stage Parkinson's disease. Based on prior work in early-stage Parkinson's disease, we aim to determine if the function of corticostriatal and cerebellar regions are impaired in RBD using task-based functional MRI and if structural changes can be detected within the caudate, putamen and substantia nigra in RBD using free-water imaging. To assess motor function, we measured performance on the Purdue Pegboard Test, which is affected in patients with RBD and Parkinson's disease. A cohort of 24 RBD, 39 early-stage Parkinson's disease and 25 controls were investigated. All participants were imaged at 3\u2005Telsa. Individuals performed a unimanual grip force task during functional imaging. Participants also completed scales to assess cognition, sleep and motor symptoms. We found decreased functional activity in both RBD and Parkinson's disease within the motor cortex, caudate, putamen and thalamus compared with controls. There was elevated free-water-corrected fractional anisotropy in the putamen in RBD and Parkinson's disease and elevated free-water in the putamen and posterior substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease compared with controls. Participants with RBD and Parkinson's disease performed significantly worse on all tasks of the Purdue Pegboard Test compared with controls. The both hands task of the Purdue Pegboard Test was most sensitive in distinguishing between groups. A subgroup analysis of early-stage RBD (<2 years diagnosis) confirmed similar findings as those in the larger RBD group. These findings provide new evidence that the putamen is affected in early-stage RBD using both functional and free-water imaging. We also found evidence that the striatum, thalamus and motor cortex have reduced functional activity in early-stage RBD and Parkinson's disease. While the substantia nigra shows elevated free-water in Parkinson's disease, we did not observe this effect in early-stage RBD. These findings point to the corticostriatal and thalamocortical circuits being impaired in RBD patients.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a prevalent non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), significantly impacting patient quality of life. The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) evaluates cognitive abilities, including planning, organization, and executive functions such as attention, memory, and visuospatial skills. This study aimed to determine the sensitivity of the CDT in diagnosing cognitive impairment in PD.\nWe reviewed the records of 44 PD patients (16 female, 28 male) diagnosed with dementia (30 patients) or mild cognitive impairment (14 patients) between 2018 and 2022. These patients were compared to 106 visitors to the neurological outpatient clinic, serving as a control group. A separate researcher assessed the patients' CDT scores, maintaining confidentiality of all other patient data except age and education level.\nAmong the 44 PD patients, two with mild cognitive impairment were rated as normal, while all PD dementia cases were identified solely through the CDT. In the healthy control group, 72 out of 106 individuals reported no cognitive complaints, whereas 34 individuals (32.1%) reported cognitive complaints as assessed by a blind investigator. The CDT demonstrated a positive predictive value of 55.3% and a negative predictive value of 97.3%. Sensitivity was calculated at 95.5%, and specificity was 67.9%.\nThe findings suggest that the CDT is sensitive in detecting cognitive impairment in PD patients with cognitive deficits. While the CDT serves as an effective rapid screening tool, high scores indicate the absence of cognitive impairment, but low scores alone are insufficient for a definitive diagnosis of dementia. Comprehensive neurological evaluation and detailed cognitive assessment remain essential for confirming dementia diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "For millennia, Cannabis sativa has served diverse roles, from medicinal applications to recreational use. Despite its extensive historical use, only a fraction of its components have been explored until recent times. The therapeutic potential of Cannabis and its constituents has garnered attention, with suggestions for treating various conditions such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and other Neurological disorders. Recent research, particularly on animal experimental models, has unveiled the neuroprotective properties of cannabis. This neuroprotective effect is orchestrated through numerous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and the two cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2. While the capacity of cannabinoids to safeguard neurons is evident, a significant challenge lies in determining the optimal cannabinoid receptor agonist and its application in clinical trials. The intricate interplay of cannabinoids with the endocannabinoid system, involving CB1 and CB2 receptors, underscores the need for precise understanding and targeted approaches. Unravelling the molecular intricacies of this interaction is vital to harness the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids effectively. As the exploration of cannabis components accelerates, there is a growing awareness of the need for nuanced strategies in utilizing cannabinoid receptor agonists in clinical settings. The evolving landscape of cannabis research presents exciting possibilities for developing targeted interventions that capitalize on the neuroprotective benefits of cannabinoids while navigating the complexities of receptor specificity and clinical applicability.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is primarily characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons, leading to significant impairments in movement. Initially, physical therapy was predominantly employed to address these motor issues through targeted rehabilitation exercises. However, recent research has indicated that cognitive training can enhance the quality of life for patients with Parkinson's. Consequently, some researchers have posited that the simultaneous engagement in computer-assisted motor and cognitive dual-task (CADT) may yield superior therapeutic outcomes.\nA comprehensive literature search was performed across various databases, and studies were selected following PRISMA guidelines, focusing on CADT rehabilitation interventions.\nDual-task training enhances Parkinson's disease (PD) rehabilitation by automating movements and minimizing secondary task interference. The inclusion of a sensor system provides real-time feedback to help patients make immediate adjustments during training. Furthermore, CADT promotes more vigorous participation and commitment to training exercises, especially those that are repetitive and can lead to patient boredom and demotivation. Virtual reality-tailored tasks, closely mirroring everyday challenges, facilitate more efficient patient adaptation post-rehabilitation.\nAlthough the current studies are limited by small sample sizes and low levels, CADT rehabilitation presents as a significant, effective, and potential strategy for PD.",

    "results": "Dual-task training enhances Parkinson's disease (PD) rehabilitation by automating movements and minimizing secondary task interference. The inclusion of a sensor system provides real-time feedback to help patients make immediate adjustments during training. Furthermore, CADT promotes more vigorous participation and commitment to training exercises, especially those that are repetitive and can lead to patient boredom and demotivation. Virtual reality-tailored tasks, closely mirroring everyday challenges, facilitate more efficient patient adaptation post-rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Pathological gait in patients with Hakim's disease (HD, synonymous with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus; iNPH), Parkinson's disease (PD), and cervical myelopathy (CM) has been subjectively evaluated in this study. We quantified the characteristics of upper and lower limb movements in patients with pathological gait. We analyzed 1491 measurements of 1 m diameter circular walking from 122, 12, and 93 patients with HD, PD, and CM, respectively, and 200 healthy volunteers using the Three-Dimensional Pose Tracker for Gait Test. Upper and lower limb movements of 2D coordinates projected onto body axis sections were derived from estimated 3D relative coordinates. The hip and knee joint angle ranges on the sagittal plane were significantly smaller in the following order: healthy > CM > PD > HD, whereas the shoulder and elbow joint angle ranges were significantly smaller, as follows: healthy > CM > HD > PD. The outward shift of the leg on the axial plane was significantly greater, as follows: healthy < CM < PD < HD, whereas the outward shift of the upper limb followed the order of healthy > CM > HD > PD. The strongest correlation between the upper and lower limb movements was identified in the angle ranges of the hip and elbow joints on the sagittal plane. The lower and upper limb movements during circular walking were correlated. Patients with HD and PD exhibited reduced back-and-forth swings of the upper and lower limbs.",

    "abstract": "Multiple system atrophy and Lewy body diseases (LBDs) such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson's disease with dementia, known as synucleinopathies, are defined neuropathologically by the accumulation and deposition of aberrant protein aggregates, primarily in neuronal cells. Seeding aggregation assays (SAA) have significant potential as biomarkers for early diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and evaluating treatment efficacy for these diseases. Real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) assays represent two ultrasensitive protein amplification techniques that were initially tested for the field of prion disorders. Although the fundamental idea behind the creation of these two methods is very similar, their technical differences resulted in different levels of diagnostic accuracy for the identification of prion proteins, making the RT-QuIC assay the most trustworthy and effective instrument for the detection of suspected cases of LBDs and prion-like diseases.",

    "abstract": "The human brain is highly dependent on oxygen, utilizing approximately 20% of the body's oxygen at rest. Oxygen deprivation to the brain can lead to loss of consciousness within seconds and death within minutes. Recent studies have identified regions of the brain with spontaneous episodic hypoxia, referred to as \"hypoxic pockets\". Hypoxia can also result from impaired blood flow due to conditions such as heart disease, blood clots, stroke, or hemorrhage, as well as from reduced oxygen intake or excessive oxygen consumption caused by factors like low ambient oxygen, pulmonary diseases, infections, inflammation, and cancer. Severe hypoxia in the brain can manifest symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease (PD), including cerebral edema, mood disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Additionally, the development of PD appears to be closely associated with hypoxia and hypoxic pathways. This review seeks to investigate the molecular interactions between hypoxia and PD, emphasizing the pathological role of hypoxic pathways in PD and exploring their potential as therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Biased agonists of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have emerged as promising selective modulators of signaling pathways by offering therapeutic advantages over unbiased agonists to minimize side effects. The dopamine D3 receptor (D3R), a pivotal GPCR in the central nervous system, has gained significant attention as a therapeutic target for neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), addiction, psychosis, depression, and anxiety. We have recently designed and tested SK609, a G-protein biased D3R selective agonist, and demonstrated its efficacy in reducing motor impairment and improving cognitive effects in a rodent model of PD. The molecular mechanism by which SK609 recruits G-protein but not \u03b2-arrestin pathways is poorly understood. Utilizing all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the distinct conformational dynamics imparted by SK609 and the reference unbiased agonist Pramipexole (PRX). Results from these studies show that the flexibility of transmembrane 3 is key to unbiased signaling, with a ~30\u00b0 and ~17\u00b0 shift in tilt angle in the D3R-Gi and D3R-\u03b2arrestin2 complexes, respectively. Additionally, untargeted phosphoproteomics analysis reveals unique phosphorylation sites by SK609 and PRX in D3R. These results suggest that SK609 induces conformational changes and unique phosphorylation patterns that promote interactions with G-proteins and are not conducive for \u03b2-arrestin2 recruitment and signaling.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) affects movement; however, most patients with PD also develop nonmotor symptoms, such as hyposmia, sleep disorder, and depression. Dopamine levels in the brain have a critical influence on movement control, but other neurotransmitters are also involved in the progression of PD. This study analyzed the fluctuation of neurotransmitters in PC12 cells during neurogenesis and neurodegeneration by performing mass spectrometry. We found that the dopaminergic metabolism pathway of PC12 cells developed vigorously during the neuron differentiation process and that the neurotransmitters were metabolized into 3-methoxytyramine, which was released from the cells. The regulation of the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of adenosine indicated that adenine nucleotides were actively utilized in neural differentiation. Moreover, we exposed the differentiated PC12 cells to rotenone, which is a suitable material for modeling PD. The cells exposed to rotenone in the early stage of differentiation exhibited stimulated serotoninergic metabolism, and the contents of the serotoninergic neurotransmitters returned to their normal levels in the late stage of differentiation. Interestingly, the nondifferentiated cells can resist the toxicant rotenone and produce normal dopaminergic metabolites. However, when differentiated neuron cells were exposed to rotenone, they were seriously damaged, leading to a failure to produce dopaminergic neurotransmitters. In the low-dosage damage process, the amino acids that functioned as dopaminergic pathway precursors could not be absorbed by the cells, and dopamine and L-dopa were secreted and unable to be reuptaken to trigger the cell damage.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal and gastrointestinal tracts, causing both motor and non-motor symptoms. This study examined the neuroprotective effects of trehalose. This sugar is confined in the gut due to the absence of transporters, so we hypothesized that trehalose might exert neuroprotective effects on PD through its action on the gut microbiota. We used a transgenic mouse model of PD (PrP-A53T G2-3) overexpressing human \u03b1-synuclein and developing GI dysfunctions. Mice were given water with trehalose, maltose, or sucrose (2% ",

    "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, and asthma are increasingly common due to factors like industrialization, urbanization, fast-paced life, stress, sedentary lifestyle, and unbalanced diet in the 21st century. These chronic conditions are a global epidemic, being among the top causes of death worldwide. Preventing these diseases through a nutritious diet is crucial, and scientific studies suggest that appropriate fruit intake, particularly apples, can lower the risk of various health issues. Apples, rich in bioactive compounds, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber, offer numerous health benefits. Regular consumption of apples helps reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, heart attacks, and diabetes, and also provides anti-asthmatic and anti-allergic effects. Apples aid in detoxification, improve digestion, enhance skin, hair, and nail health, and offer protection against cancers, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Apples have been a dietary staple for centuries, consumed in various forms like juices, sauces, and ciders. The reviewed article emphasizes the health benefits of apples, highlighting their role in preventing civilization diseases. It also discusses the characteristics of common apple varieties and the impact of thermal processing on their nutritional content.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is challenging, especially in the earlier stages of the disease, owing to the clinical overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to identify the transcranial sonography (TCS) parameters that can help us\u00a0to detect early DLB patients.\nIn this cross-sectional study, we prospectively recruited newly diagnosed DLB patients with less than 3 years from the onset of cognitive symptoms. For comparison purposes, we also included AD and PD patients, with a disease duration of less than 3 years, and a control group. TCS was performed to assess the substantia nigra (SN) echogenicity, the width of the third ventricle, and the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. Subsequently, TCS images were analyzed with the medical image viewer Horos in order to quantify the intensity of the echogenicity of the SN. Univariate analysis and a logistic regression model were used to identify which variables can predict the diagnosis of DLB.\nOne hundred and seven participants were included (23 DLB, 26 AD, 27 PD and 31 controls). The median age of DLB patients was 75(72-77) years, with a disease duration of 2\u00a0years. DLB and PD patients showed higher SN hyperechogenicity rates (72.73% and 81.82%, respectively) and a greater area of the SN compared to AD patients and controls (p\u2009<\u20090.001). DLB and AD patients had wider ventricular systems than the other study groups. The SN hyperechogenicity predicted a diagnosis of DLB with an odds ratio of 22.67 (95%CI 3.98; 129.12, p\u2009<\u20090.001) when compared to AD patients. Unilateral and bilateral widened frontal horns predicted diagnosis of DLB compared to PD with an odds ratio of 9.5 (95%CI 0.97; 92.83, p\u2009=\u20090.053) and 5.7 (95%CI 0.97; 33.6, p\u2009=\u20090.054), respectively.\nEchogenicity of the SN and widening of the frontal horns of lateral ventricles can predict the diagnosis of early DLB in this cohort of newly diagnosed patients, when compared to AD and PD patients. Transcranial sonography, a non-invasive tool, could be helpful for the diagnosis of DLB at its earlier stages.",

    "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that often overlaps clinically with Alzheimer's disease (AD), presenting challenges in accurate diagnosis and underscoring the need for novel biomarkers. Lipidomic emerges as a promising avenue for uncovering disease-specific metabolic alterations and potential biomarkers, particularly as the lipidomics landscape of DLB has not been previously explored. We aim to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers and elucidate the disease's pathophysiological mechanisms.\nThis study conducted a lipidomic analysis of plasma samples from patients with DLB, AD, and healthy controls (HCs) at Xuanwu Hospital. Untargeted plasma lipidomic profiling was conducted via liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Machine learning methods were employed to discern lipidomic signatures specific to DLB and to differentiate it from AD.\nThe study enrolled 159 participants, including 57 with AD, 48 with DLB, and 54 HCs. Significant differences in lipid profiles were observed between the DLB and HC groups, particularly in the classes of sphingolipids and phospholipids. A total of 55 differentially expressed lipid species were identified between DLB and HCs, and 17 between DLB and AD. Correlations were observed linking these lipidomic profiles to clinical parameters like Unified Parkinson's\u00a0Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III) and cognitive scores. Machine learning models demonstrated to be\u00a0highly effective in distinguishing DLB from both HCs and AD, achieving substantial accuracy through the utilization of specific lipidomic signatures. These include PC(15:0_18:2), PC(15:0_20:5), and SPH(d16:0) for differentiation between DLB and HCs; and a panel includes 13 lipid molecules: four PCs, two PEs, three SPHs, two Cers, and two Hex1Cers for distinguishing DLB from AD.\nThis study presents a novel and comprehensive lipidomic profile of DLB, distinguishing it from AD and HCs. Predominantly, sphingolipids (e.g., ceramides and SPHs) and phospholipids (e.g., PE and PC) were the most dysregulated lipids in relation to DLB patients. The lipidomics panels identified through machine learning may serve as effective plasma biomarkers for diagnosing DLB and differentiating it from AD dementia.",

    "results": "The study enrolled 159 participants, including 57 with AD, 48 with DLB, and 54 HCs. Significant differences in lipid profiles were observed between the DLB and HC groups, particularly in the classes of sphingolipids and phospholipids. A total of 55 differentially expressed lipid species were identified between DLB and HCs, and 17 between DLB and AD. Correlations were observed linking these lipidomic profiles to clinical parameters like Unified Parkinson's\u00a0Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III) and cognitive scores. Machine learning models demonstrated to be\u00a0highly effective in distinguishing DLB from both HCs and AD, achieving substantial accuracy through the utilization of specific lipidomic signatures. These include PC(15:0_18:2), PC(15:0_20:5), and SPH(d16:0) for differentiation between DLB and HCs; and a panel includes 13 lipid molecules: four PCs, two PEs, three SPHs, two Cers, and two Hex1Cers for distinguishing DLB from AD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, was classically attributed to alpha-synuclein aggregation and consequent loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Recently, emerging evidence suggested a broader spectrum of contributing factors, including exosome-mediated intercellular communication, which can potentially serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, there is a remarkable lack of comprehensive studies that connect the serum exosome microRNA (miRNA) transcriptome with demographic, clinical, and neuroimaging data in PD patients. Here, we present serum exosome miRNA transcriptome data generated from four cohort studies. Two of these studies include 96 PD patients and 80 age- and gender-matched controls, with anonymised demographic, clinical, and neuroimaging data provided for PD patients. The other two studies involve 96 PD patients who were evaluated both before and after one year of treatment with rasagiline, a widely prescribed anti-parkinsonism drug. Together, the datasets provide a valuable source for understanding pathogenesis and discovering biomarkers and therapeutic targets in PD.",

    "abstract": "Identifying genetic drivers of chronic diseases is necessary for drug discovery. Here, we develop a machine learning-assisted genetic priority score, which we call ML-GPS, that incorporates genetic associations with predicted disease phenotypes to enhance target discovery. First, we construct gradient boosting models to predict 112 chronic disease phecodes in the UK Biobank and analyze associations of predicted and observed phenotypes with common, rare, and ultra-rare variants to model the allelic series. We integrate these associations with existing evidence using gradient boosting with continuous feature encoding to construct ML-GPS, training it to predict drug indications in Open Targets and externally testing it in SIDER. We then generate ML-GPS predictions for 2,362,636 gene-phecode pairs. We find that the use of predicted phenotypes, which identify substantially more genetic associations than observed phenotypes across the allele frequency spectrum, significantly improves the performance of ML-GPS. ML-GPS increases coverage of drug targets, with the top 1% of all scores providing support for 15,077 gene-phecode pairs that previously had no support. ML-GPS can also identify well-known target-disease relationships, promising targets without indicated drugs, and targets for several drugs in clinical trials, including LRRK2 inhibitors for Parkinson's disease and olpasiran for cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Drug repurposing (DR) offers a compelling alternative to traditional drug discovery's lengthy, resource-intensive process. DR is the process of identifying alternative clinical applications for pre-approved drugs as a low-risk and low-cost strategy. Computational approaches are crucial during the early hypothesis-generating stage of DR. However, 'large-scale' data retrieval remains a significant challenge. A computational workflow addressing such limitations might improve hypothesis generation, ultimately benefit patients and advance DR research.\nWe introduce a novel computational workflow (combining free-accessible computational platforms) to provide 'proof-of-concept' of the pre-approved drug's suitability for repurposing. Three key phases are included: target fishing (via reverse pharmacophore mapping), target identification (via disease- and drug-target pathway identification) and retrospective literature and drug-like analysis (via in silico ADMET properties determination). Istradefylline is a Parkinson's disease-approved drug with literature-attributed antidepressant properties remaining unclear. Practically applied, istradefylline's antidepressant activity was assessed in the context of major depressive disorder (MDD).\nData mining aided by target identification resulted in istradefylline potentially representing a novel antidepressant drug class. Retrieved drug targets (KYNU, MAO-B, ALOX12 and PLCB2) associated with selected MDD pathways (tryptophan metabolism and serotonergic synapse) generated a hypothesis that istradefylline increased extracellular 5-HT levels (MAO-B inhibition) and reduced inflammation (KYNU, ALOX12 and PLCB2 inhibition).\nThe practically applied workflow's generated hypothesis aligns with known experimental data, validating the effectiveness of this novel computational workflow. It is a low-risk and low-cost DR computational tool providing a bird's-eye view for exploring alternative clinical applications of pre-approved drugs.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests that alterations in gut microbial composition play an active role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Probiotics are believed to modulate gut microbiota, potentially influencing PD development through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the potential beneficial effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SG5 (formerly known as Lactobacillus plantarum, abbreviated as L. plantarum) on PD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we employed immunofluorescence, Western blotting, ELISA, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the neuroprotective effects of L. plantarum SG5 against neuroinflammation in an MPTP-induced PD model and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that L. plantarum SG5 ameliorated MPTP-induced motor deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss, and elevated \u03b1-synuclein protein levels. Furthermore, SG5 inhibited MPTP-triggered overactivation of microglia and astrocytes in the substantia nigra (SN), attenuated disruption of both blood-brain and intestinal barriers, and suppressed the release of inflammatory factors in the colon and SN. Notably, SG5 modulated the composition and structure of the gut microbiota in mice. The MPTP-induced decrease in colonic GLP-1 secretion was reversed by SG5 treatment, accompanied by increased expression of GLP-1R and PGC-1\u03b1 in the SN. Importantly, the GLP-1R antagonist Exendin 9-39 and PGC-1\u03b1 inhibitor SR18292 attenuated the protective effects of SG5 in PD mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate a neuroprotective role of L. plantarum SG5 in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model, which likely involves modulation of the gut microbiota and, significantly, the GLP-1/PGC-1\u03b1 signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal accumulation of insoluble \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) inclusions in neurons, neurites, and glial cells is the defining neuropathology of synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy. Accumulation of \u03b1-Syn inclusions in the amygdala has been well-documented in post-mortem studies of PD and DLB brains, as well as preclinical animal models of these conditions. Though \u03b1-Syn pathology is closely associated with neurodegeneration, there is a poor correlation between neuronal loss in the amygdala and the clinical features of PD and DLB. Moreover, functional interaction between the cerebral cortex and the amygdala is critical to regulating emotion, motivation, and social behaviors. The cortico-amygdala functional interaction is likely to be disrupted by the development of \u03b1-Syn pathology in the brain. Thus, we hypothesize that neuronal \u03b1-Syn inclusions disrupt cortical modulation of the amygdala circuits and are sufficient to drive social behavioral deficits. In the present work, we designed a series of longitudinal studies to rigorously measure the time courses of neurodegeneration, functional impairment of cortico-amygdala connectivity, and development of amygdala-dependent social behavioral deficits to test this hypothesis. We injected \u03b1-Syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the dorsal striatum to induce \u03b1-Syn aggregation in the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of C57BL6 mice of both sexes, followed by a detailed analysis of temporal development of \u03b1-Syn pathology, synaptic deficits, and neuronal loss in the amygdala, as well as behavioral deficits at 3-12\u00a0months post injections. Development of \u03b1-Syn inclusions caused losses of cortical axon terminals and cell death in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) at 6- and 12-months post injections, respectively. At a relatively early stage of 3\u00a0months post injections, the connection strength of the mPFC-BLA synapse was decreased in PFFs-injection mice compared to controls. Meanwhile, the PFFs-injected mice showed impaired social interaction behavior, which was rescued by chemogenetic stimulation of mPFC-BLA connections. Altogether, we presented a series of evidence to delineate circuit events in the amygdala associated with the accumulation of \u03b1-Syn inclusions in the mouse brain, highlighting that functional impairment of the amygdala is sufficient to cause social behavior deficits. The present work further suggests that early circuit modulation could be an effective approach to alleviate symptoms associated with \u03b1-Syn pathology, necessitating studies of functional consequences of \u03b1-Syn aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Increased levels of lactoferrin (Lf) are present in the aged brain and in the lesions of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), and may contribute to the cascade of events involved in neurodevelopment and neuroprotection. However, whether Lf originates from astrocytes and functions within either the normal or pathological brain are unknown. Here, we employed mice with specific knockout of the astrocyte lactoferrin gene (named Lf-cKO) to explore its specific roles in the pathological process of PD. We observed a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells, mitochondrial dysfunction of residual dopaminergic neurons, and motor deficits in Lf-cKO mice, which were significantly aggravated after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment. To further explore how astrocytic lactoferrin deficiency exacerbated PD-like manifestation in MPTP-treated mice, the critical molecules involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contacts and signaling pathways were investigated. In vitro and in vivo models, we found an aberrant level of effects implicated in glutamate and calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial morphology and functions, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondria-associated ER membranes, accompanied by signs of oxidative stress and ER stress, which increase the fragility of dopaminergic neurons. These findings confirm the existence of astrocytic Lf and its influence on the fate of dopaminergic neurons by regulating glutamate/calcium metabolism and ER-mitochondria signaling. Our findings may be a promising target for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a conserved mechanism that degrades damaged or superfluous cellular contents and enables nutrient recycling under starvation conditions. Many neurodegeneration-associated proteins are autophagy substrates, and autophagy upregulation ameliorates disease in many animal models of neurodegeneration by enhancing the clearance of toxic proteins, proinflammatory molecules, and dysfunctional organelles. Autophagy inhibition also induces neuronal and glial senescence, a phenomenon that occurs with increasing age in non-diseased brains as well as in response to neurodegeneration-associated stresses. However, aging and many neurodegeneration-associated proteins and mutations impair autophagy. This creates a potentially detrimental feedback loop whereby the accumulation of these disease-associated proteins impairs their autophagic clearance, facilitating their further accumulation and aggregation. Thus, understanding how autophagy interacts with aging, senescence, and neurodegenerative diseases in a temporal, cellular, and genetic context is important for the future clinical application of autophagy-modulating therapies in aging and neurodegeneration.",

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were derived from a 29-year-old PD patient carrying a heterozygous c.823C\u00a0>\u00a0T (p.R275W) variant and an exon 2-4 deletion in PRKN. The Generated iPSCs maintain a normal karyotype, express pluripotency markers, and retain the ability to differentiate into the three germ layers.

    "abstract": "Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, which is prone to flares and requires continuous management and treatment. However, long-term use of drugs can lead to additional adverse drug reactions. Based on the comorbid relationship between rosacea and Parkinson's disease, bioinformatics and network pharmacology analysis were used to identify a safer drug for rosacea. It has been demonstrated that ISA has an ameliorative impact on the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The results demonstrated that ISA exhibited anti-inflammatory properties, including reducing erythema areas and inflammatory cell infiltration in rosacea-like mice models, and inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors in cellular inflammation models. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effect of ISA was associated with inhibition of the Erk, p38 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways and inhibition of macrophage polarization to M1 type. In addition, molecular docking and drug affinity responsive target stability experiment results indicated that VEGFA and RELA were the direct targets of ISA in the treatment for rosacea. In conclusion, these results suggested that ISA may be a potential therapeutic agent for rosacea.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD) are common and often adversely affect quality of life. Light therapy has benefited sleep quality and mood outcomes in various populations but results to date with conventional light therapy boxes in PD patients have been mixed. We hypothesized that a passive lighting intervention, applied in the morning and designed to maximally affect the circadian system, would improve measures of sleep and mood in PD patients.\nIn this single-arm, within-subjects intervention study, baseline objective sleep (actigraphy), subjective sleep quality (questionnaires), and subjective mood (questionnaires) data were collected for 1 week. Lighting was then administered to participants via table/floor lamps installed in the home or via personal light therapy glasses for 2\u00a0h in the morning, 7 days per week, over the following 4-week period. Post-intervention data for the same outcomes were collected during the final week of the intervention period.\nAmong 20 participants (12 women, 8 men; mean [SD] age 72.1 [9.5] years, disease duration 9.0 [5.2] years), objective sleep duration increased significantly by 28.5 min (p = 0.029) and objective sleep time increased significantly by 19.9\u00a0min (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026).\nPassive and easily administered lighting interventions for improving sleep in PD patients hold promise as a treatment for mitigating symptoms and improving quality of life in PD.",

    "abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by autonomic failure and motor impairment. The hallmark pathologic finding in MSA is widespread oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions rich in aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn). MSA is widely held to be an oligodendroglial synucleinopathy, and we outline lines of evidence to support this assertion, including the presence of early myelin loss. We consider emerging data that support the possibility of neuronal or immune dysfunction as primary drivers of MSA. These hypotheses are placed in the context of a major recent discovery that \u03b1Syn is conformationally distinct in MSA versus other synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease. We outline emerging techniques in epidemiology, genetics, and molecular pathology that will shed more light on this mysterious disease. We anticipate a future in which cutting-edge developments in personalized disease modeling, including with pluripotent stem cells, bridge mechanistic developments at the bench and real benefits at the bedside.",

    "abstract": "Patients with multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease may experience pelvic floor dysfunction and constipation which can affect ileoanal pouch emptying. This can lead to complications such as pouchitis, pouch dysfunction, and failure. We hypothesized that patients with neurological diseases have a higher rate of pouch failure and complications than healthy controls.\nData were sourced from the institutional ileoanal pouch database. Patients with multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease, diagnosed before or after pouch construction, were matched to a control group of patients without neurological disease using propensity score-optimal matching. Demographics, postoperative and functional outcomes, and quality of life were analyzed.\nTwenty-six patients (38%) with multiple sclerosis and 16 (62%) with Parkinson's disease were matched with 42 healthy controls. The overall median age was 39 years, median BMI was 25.3\u00a0kg/m\nPatients with multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease might differ in pouch function compared with healthy controls. These neurological diseases might affect pouch function. The rate of pouch failure was similar, showing its feasibility despite multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Hsp70 is a key cellular system counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, associated with stress, ageing, and disease. Hsp70 solubilises aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). Here, we elucidate the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes throughout Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing. We show that Hsp110 plays a major role at initial stages of disaggregation, determining its final efficacy. The NEF catalyses the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto aggregate surface, which modifies aggregates into smaller species more readily processed by chaperones. Hsp70 stimulation by Hsp110 is much stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction. Such destabilisation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface might improve disaggregation, but also lead to the inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum. Thus, balanced interplay between the co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential.\nFor proteins to accurately carry out their role in the cell, they must first be precisely folded into specific 3D shapes. Stress, aging or disease can interfere with this delicate process, leading to misfolded proteins clumping together and causing damage. In response, the cell can deploy \u2018chaperones\u2019 which disentangle these aggregates and ensure that proteins recover their proper structure. Chaperones from the Hsp70 protein family, for example, are crucial for cell survival, especially under biologically stressful conditions. Yet Hsp70 proteins cannot perform their role without the assistance of co-chaperones such as Hsp110; why this is the case, however, has remained unclear. To investigate this question, Sztangierska et al. used a variety of biochemical assays to test how purified human and yeast Hsp70, Hsp110 and other co-chaperones could bind aggregates and recover misfolded proteins. The role of each protein was examined at every stage of the disaggregation process \u2013 from the initial aggregate binding, through chaperone-driven changes in aggregate structure to the final protein folding. The experiments revealed that Hsp110 helps draw Hsp70 to the aggregate surface, breaking down the protein \u2018clump\u2019 into smaller pieces which are more easily processed by other chaperones. The results also showed that the various co-chaperones compete for Hsp70 binding; too much of one might interfere with another, emphasizing the need for balance between chaperones for optimal disaggregation. Overall, these results clarify the role of Hsp110 in the Hsp70 system and reveal several mechanistic details of the protein rescue process. Further experiments will be needed to fully understand these dynamics and identify how they may be relevant to conditions in which harmful protein aggregates are observed, such as Parkinson\u2019s or Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein into toxic amyloid fibrils. Recent research suggests that bile acids altered in PD may influence their aggregation. This study investigates the effects of lithocholic acid (LCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA) on \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and toxicity. LCA significantly accelerates aggregation, reducing the lag phase by 75%, while DCA has a milder impact, decreasing the lag phase by 30%. Binding studies show that LCA interacts with the NAC region and DCA with the N-terminal region of \u03b1-synuclein. Aggregation assays and electrophoresis reveal that LCA promotes the formation of toxic, SDS-resistant oligomers more effectively than DCA. Cytotoxicity assays confirm a lower cell viability in LCA-treated samples. Additionally, combined LCA and DCA treatment results in enhanced aggregation and toxicity, indicating a synergistic effect. These findings highlight the role of bile acids in \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and PD pathogenesis, suggesting that targeting bile acid metabolism could be a therapeutic strategy for PD.",

    "abstract": "The link between alpha Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) phosphorylation and Parkinson's disease pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, in part due to analytical methods with finite specificity and sensitivity, resulting in conflicting data on pathophysiological levels of the protein.One factor hindering the assessment of the role of pSer129 \u03b1-Syn is the lack of a fit for purpose assay. Antibodies were assessed for quantification of pSer129 \u03b1-Syn, resulting in a sensitive and specific assay suitable for use in Parkinson's disease and control CSF, with no significant difference found between the two populations. Total \u03b1-Syn was measured using a commercial kit, demonstrating a positive correlation between total and pSer129 \u03b1-Syn.This adds to available methods for pSer129 \u03b1-Syn in support of \u03b1-synucleinopathy research.\n[Box: see text].",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly affects patients' quality of life. Treatment of PD requires accurate assessment of motor and non-motor symptoms, which is often complicated by subjectivity in reporting symptoms, and the limited availability of neurologists. Commercial wearable devices, which monitor PD symptoms continuously and outside the clinical setting, have appeared to address these challenges. These devices include PKG\u2122, Kinesia 360\u2122, Kinesia U\u2122, PDMonitor\u2122 and STAT-ON\u2122. These devices use advanced technologies, including accelerometers, gyroscopes and specific algorithms to provide objective data on motor symptoms, such as tremor, dyskinesia and bradykinesia. Despite their potential, the adoption of these devices has been limited, due to concerns about their accuracy, complexity of use and the lack of independent validation. The correlation between the measurements obtained from these devices and traditional clinical observations varies, and their usability and patient adherence are critical areas for improvement. Validation and usability studies with a sufficient number of patients, standardised protocols and integration with hospitals' IT systems are essential to optimise their usefulness and improve patient outcomes.\nDispositivos comerciales para la monitorizaci\u00f3n de s\u00edntomas en la enfermedad de Parkinson: beneficios, limitaciones y tendencias.\nResumen. La enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es un trastorno neurodegenerativo que afecta significativamente a la calidad de vida de los pacientes. El tratamiento de la EP requiere una evaluaci\u00f3n precisa de los s\u00edntomas motores y no motores, que a menudo se complica por la subjetividad en el informe de s\u00edntomas y la limitada disponibilidad de neur\u00f3logos. Para abordar estos desaf\u00edos han surgido dispositivos comerciales vestibles que monitorizan los s\u00edntomas de la EP de manera continua y fuera del entorno cl\u00ednico. Entre los principales dispositivos se encuentran PKG\u2122, Kinesia 360\u2122, Kinesia U\u2122, PDMonitor\u2122 y STAT-ON\u2122. Estos dispositivos utilizan tecnolog\u00edas avanzadas, como aceler\u00f3metros, giroscopios y algoritmos espec\u00edficos, para proporcionar datos objetivos sobre s\u00edntomas motores, como temblores, discinesia y bradicinesia. A pesar de su potencial, la adopci\u00f3n de estos dispositivos es limitada, debido a preocupaciones sobre su precisi\u00f3n, la complejidad de su uso y la falta de validaci\u00f3n independiente. La correlaci\u00f3n entre las mediciones de estos dispositivos y las observaciones cl\u00ednicas tradicionales var\u00eda, y la usabilidad y la adhesi\u00f3n del paciente son \u00e1reas cr\u00edticas de mejora. Para optimizar su utilidad y mejorar los resultados para los pacientes, es esencial realizar estudios de validaci\u00f3n y usabilidad con un n\u00famero suficiente de pacientes, desarrollar protocolos estandarizados y asegurar la integraci\u00f3n con sistemas inform\u00e1ticos hospitalarios.",

    "abstract": "Multiple factors can cause sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease. The quality of sleep and therefore of life is usually improved with continuous dopaminergic stimulation therapies, such as continuous subcutaneous infusion of apomorphine.\nWe present an observational retrospective study of patients at our centre with advanced Parkinson's disease, treated with continuous infusion of apomorphine, with treatment extended to nights, between 2011 and 2022. We collected data from 37 patients, and evaluated the indication for nocturnal treatment, efficacy, safety and reasons for withdrawal.\nFifty percent of patients began nocturnal treatment for motor complications, 19% for non-motor complications and 31% for both. The most common non-motor symptoms were sleep fragmentation and disturbances, neuropathic pain, psychiatric symptoms and intense nocturia. Twenty of the 37 patients (54%) were continuing treatment at the end of the study follow-up, 16 (43%) discontinued the infusion, and one (3%) was lost to follow-up. The adverse reactions that led to termination of the infusion were severe nodules (two), dopaminergic psychosis (one) and a positive Coombs test with/without anaemia (one). Four patients terminated the nocturnal infusions while continuing the daytime infusions due to suboptimal adaptation to the device. Patients whose symptoms improved without any significant adverse effects continued the treatment.\nContinuous infusion of apomorphine during the night was an effective and safe treatment in our series.\nUso de infusi\u00f3n subcut\u00e1nea continua nocturna de apomorfina en la enfermedad de Parkinson avanzada: una serie de 37 casos.\nIntroducci\u00f3n. Existen m\u00faltiples factores que pueden causar alteraciones del sue\u00f1o en la enfermedad de Parkinson. La calidad del sue\u00f1o y, por ende, de vida suele mejorar con terapias de estimulaci\u00f3n dopamin\u00e9rgica continua, como la infusi\u00f3n subcut\u00e1nea continua de apomorfina.

Recopilamos datos de 37 pacientes en los que evaluamos la indicaci\u00f3n de uso nocturno, eficacia, seguridad y motivos de retirada. Resultados. El 50% de los pacientes inici\u00f3 el tratamiento nocturno por complicaciones motoras, el 19% por complicaciones no motoras y el 31% por ambas. Los s\u00edntomas no motores m\u00e1s comunes fueron: fragmentaci\u00f3n y alteraciones del sue\u00f1o, dolor neurop\u00e1tico, s\u00edntomas psiqui\u00e1tricos y nicturia intensa. De los 37 pacientes, 20 (54%) continuaban con el tratamiento al final del seguimiento del estudio, 16 (43%) discontinuaron la infusi\u00f3n y se perdi\u00f3 el seguimiento de uno (3%). Las reacciones adversas que llevaron a finalizar la infusi\u00f3n fueron: n\u00f3dulos graves (dos), psicosis dopamin\u00e9rgica (uno) y Coombs + con/sin anemia (uno). Cuatro pacientes finalizaron la infusi\u00f3n nocturna manteniendo la infusi\u00f3n diurna por adaptaci\u00f3n sub\u00f3ptima al dispositivo.

    "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common disorder characterized by excessive fear of scrutiny and embarrassment, leading to severe distress and avoidance behaviors or dysfunctions. SAD and other relevant diseases have been reported to be associated with a higher risk of aging-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes mellitus. Recently, epigenetic clock analysis, which measures biological aging based on comprehensive DNA methylation (DNAm) status, has been widely conducted. We conducted epigenetic clock analyses in patients with SAD and controls, examining various epigenetic age acceleration and DNAm-based predictive values of aging-related proteins (GrimAge components and GrimAge2 components), including leptin level.\nWe used the publicly available DNAm dataset, GSE164056, which consists of 66 patients with SAD and 77 controls of Caucasian descent aged between 18 and 50\u2009years. We conducted regression analyses investigating the association between SAD and various indices of epigenetic aging, using age and sex as covariates.\nNone of the epigenetic clocks showed significant differences in age acceleration. Of the DNAm-based predictive values of aging-related proteins, leptin level in GrimAge components (q\u2009=\u20090.0123) and GrimAge2 components (q\u2009=\u20090.0123) were significantly lower in patients with SAD than in controls.\nThe results of this study suggested that leptin may be involved in SAD pathogenesis as an aging-related protein. Therefore, further studies with different designs are required.",

    "abstract": "Evidence has suggested that cognitive decline may be a risk factor for freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Complex and challenging exercises have been suggested as potential rehabilitation strategies to decrease FOG severity and improve cognition; however, it is unknown whether improvement in cognition would explain decreased FOG severity following exercise.\nIn this secondary analysis, we evaluated the effects of the adapted resistance training with instability (ARTI-complex and challenging exercises) compared with traditional motor rehabilitation (TMR-without challenging exercises) on cognitive function in people with FOG of PD. We also verified whether cognitive improvement explains the decrease in FOG previously published.\nParticipants were randomized to either the experimental group (ARTI, n\u2009=\u200917) or the active control group (TMR, n\u2009=\u200915). Both training groups exercised 3 times a week for 12\u2009weeks (80-90\u2009minute each session). FOG severity (FOG ratio from inertial sensors during a 360\u00b0 turning-in-place task), frontal lobe function (Frontal Assessment Battery [FAB]), global cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]), and attention and psychomotor speed (Digit Symbol Substitution Test [DSST]) were evaluated before and after interventions.\nOnly the ARTI group improved FAB, MoCA, and DSST scores at posttraining. In addition, ARTI was more effective than TMR in improving FAB scores at posttraining. The changes in FAB scores explained the changes in FOG ratio following ARTI (\nThis pilot study suggests that ARTI, a complex and challenging training, improves cognition in people with FOG of PD. Improvements in frontal lobe function with ARTI help explain decreased FOG severity.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by age-dependent neurodegeneration and the accumulation of toxic phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein (pS129-\u03b1-syn). The mechanisms underlying these crucial pathological changes remain unclear. Mutations in parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PARK2), the gene encoding parkin that is phosphorylated by PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) to participate in mitophagy, cause early onset PD. However, current parkin-KO mouse and pig models do not exhibit neurodegeneration. In the current study, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 technology to establish parkin-deficient monkey models at different ages. We found that parkin deficiency leads to substantia nigra neurodegeneration in adult monkey brains and that parkin phosphorylation decreases with aging, primarily due to increased insolubility of parkin. Phosphorylated parkin is important for neuroprotection and the reduction of pS129-\u03b1-syn. Consistently, overexpression of WT parkin, but not a mutant form that cannot be phosphorylated by PINK1, reduced the accumulation of pS129-\u03b1-syn. These findings identify parkin phosphorylation as a key factor in PD pathogenesis and suggest it as a promising target for therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms, including depression, which significantly impacts the quality of life of affected individuals. This study aims to investigate the real-world effectiveness and safety of duloxetine in treating comorbid depression in patients with Parkinson's disease and to compare its outcomes with traditional treatment approaches.\nThis study included adult patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease combined with depression from December 2020 to December 2023. Based on the use of duloxetine, the cohort was divided into a traditional treatment group and a duloxetine group (traditional treatment combined with duloxetine). Patients with incomplete medical records, concurrent antidepressant therapy, or major psychiatric or neurological disorders were excluded. Retrospective data, including demographic information, treatment adherence, and various assessment scores, were collected from medical records by trained research staff.\nIn total, 106 patients were analyzed, with 50 patients receiving traditional treatment and 56 patients receiving duloxetine. The duloxetine group exhibited significantly lower scores than the traditional treatment group in the Unified PD Rating Scale (p = 0.015), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (p = 0.013), Beck Depression Inventory (p = 0.031), Parkinson's disease Questionnaire-39 (p = 0.006), and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (p < 0.001) scores. In motor function assessment, the duloxetine group demonstrated improvements in kinetic tremor scores (p = 0.017), gait speed (p < 0.001), Timed Up and Go Test performance (p < 0.001), dyskinesia severity (p = 0.017), and rigidity (p = 0.019) compared to the traditional treatment group. Additionally, the duloxetine group exhibited better cognitive function across various assessments, including the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (p = 0.024), Stroop Color-Word Test (p = 0.048), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (p = 0.024).\nDuloxetine is associated with superior efficacy in improving motor and non-motor symptoms, overall clinical status, and cognitive function. These findings support the potential utility of duloxetine as a comprehensive treatment option for comorbid depression in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Pimavanserin is an efficacious, atypical neuroleptic. It ameliorates the frequency and severity of hallucinations and delusions in patients with Parkinson's disease with psychosis. Most antipsychotic drugs directly block dopamine receptors and thus worsen motor behavior. In contrast pimavanserin reduces the activity of excitatory serotonin receptor subtypes. They stimulate dopaminergic pathways in the mesolimbic system. As a result onset of psychosis may occur particularly in patients on a chronic dopamine substituting treatment regimen, like in Parkinson's disease.\nThis narrative drug evaluation describes the properties and effects of pimavanserin. It is approved for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson's disease. A literature research was performed with the terms dopamine, levodopa, psychosis, Parkinson's disease without standardized selection of cited references.\nAn essential advantage of pimavanserin is the focus in the pivotal trials on the treatment of psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease. Main competitors for the use in clinical practice are the atypical neuroleptic compounds quetiapine and clozapine. Both share considerable structural and pharmacological similarities, i.e. certain anticholinergic properties. They are recommended in guidelines. Once pimavanserin will become available as a generic drug, its use will probably increase worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Microinstability, characterized by subtle and often painful disturbances in joint stability, significantly impacts individuals engaged in activities requiring extensive ranges of motion, such as dancing or gymnastics, and is particularly prevalent in young female athletes. This condition, resulting from progressive microtrauma, architectural and functional abnormalities, or iatrogenic factors, is challenging to diagnose and often underreported. Understanding the biomechanical nuances of microinstability is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective management. Upper limb joints, including the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand, each exhibit unique anatomical and functional characteristics that contribute to their susceptibility to microinstability. Movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia, and cerebral palsy, exacerbate joint instability due to impaired proprioception, altered muscle tone, and uncoordinated muscle contractions. Effective diagnosis involves physical examination techniques and advanced imaging modalities. Therapeutic interventions encompass physical therapy, pharmacological treatments, surgical procedures, and assistive devices, tailored to enhance joint stability and improve the quality of life for affected individuals.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impacts patients' quality of life. Recent evidence has highlighted a complex relationship between the gut microbiota (GM) and PD. Understanding this relationship is crucial for potentially targeting GM in PD treatment and expanding therapeutic options. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the global landscape, trends, and research focus on GM and PD using bibliometric analysis. Utilizing publications from the Web of Science Core Collection (WsSCC), bibliometric tools such as the R package 'Bibliometrix,' VOS viewer, and CiteSpace software were employed to assess parameters like yearly publications, countries/regions, institutions, and authors. Research trends and hotspots were identified through keyword analysis. The results revealed 1,161 articles published between 2013-2023, with China leading in publications (n=352, 30.31% of total), while the United States had a higher influence (H-index=58). The University of California System was the top institution in terms of publications (n=35), with the National Natural Science Foundation of China funding the most projects (n=172).

    "abstract": "Besides being an essential structural component of plasma membranes and the precursor of many functional compounds and signaling molecules, cholesterol was also proposed to play a role in the etiology and/or manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, so far systematic investigations on the role of cholesterol and its metabolites present in the brain for the etiology of PD are missing. Here, we investigate for the first time the association of PD with SNPs in the genes of four cytochromes P450 (P450), CYP46A1, CYP39A1, CYP27A1 and CYP7B1, which are critical for the degradation of cholesterol in the brain. Analyzing 1,349 individuals from the PPMI data base, we found 24 SNPs in these four genes, which are significantly over- or under-represented in patients suffering from idiopathic PD (IPD). Studying each of the 362 IPD patients individually, we found that most patients (45%) showed only one associated SNP in one of the four P450 genes, while 31% displayed two associated SNPs and 18% three associated SNPs. The occurrence of some associated SNPs is in the same order of magnitude as SNPs in the GBA (beta-glucocerebrosidase) and thus might reflect a genetic predisposition for PD. As all 24 SNPs were located in introns and 3' untranslated regions, we evaluated the prospective regulatory impact of the surrounding genomic regions by using transcriptome and epigenome data from the Foundational Data Initiative for Parkinson Disease (FOUNDIN-PD). FOUNDIN-PD provides gene expression, open chromatin and DNA methylation data in a cohort of 89 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines differentiated to dopaminergic (DA) neurons derived from people in the PPMI study. Indeed, two of the 24 SNPs, one in CYP7B1 (rs118111353) and the other one in CYP27A1 (rs74446825), were localized within a region of open chromatin in differentiated neurons. Interestingly, all iPSC lines with open chromatin in rs118111353 showed the reference allele. As all four P450, CYP46A1, CYP39A1, CYP27A1 and CYP7B1, are expressed in dopaminergic neurons, we discuss further functional studies to connect SNPs in regulatory regions with gene expression levels. Finally, potential possibilities for personalized therapeutic treatment of patients with SNPs in the four investigated P450 are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Gaucher's disease (GD), a lysosomal storage disorder, poses significant treatment challenges. This 23-year study assesses survival rates and treatment efficacy in Brazilian GD patients, integrating data from a 16-year cohort (2000-2015) and the TABNET/DATASUS medicines distribution data (1999-2022).\nTo investigate the survival of GD patients in Brazil, identifying key risk factors and evaluating the impact of treatments funded by the Brazilian National Health System (SUS).\nA 16-year retrospective cohort study was conducted using the National Database of SUS. Patients diagnosed with GD and treated with Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) or Substrate Synthesis Inhibition (SSI) from 2000 to 2015 were included. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. The data from TABNET/DATASUS system from 1999 to 2022 was used to assess the trend in drug distribution beyond the main cohort.\nThe study included 1,234 patients. Survival rates at 5 and 10\u00a0years were 93.2% and 88.5%, respectively, with age and comorbidities like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and Parkinson's disease significantly affecting survival. Patients who received doses lower than DDD (n = 880) demonstrated a survival probability of 91.8%. In contrast, those with doses equal to the DDD (n = 15) showed a 100% survival probability, as no events were observed in this group. The greater than DDD group (n = 339) exhibited a survival probability of 81%. A log-rank test indicated a borderline statistical significance (\nThis study provides insights into the survival rates and associated risk factors for GD patients in Brazil, contributing to the global understanding of GD and its management. While we acknowledge the inherent limitations of relying largely on electronic medical records and categorical codes, our findings underscore the need for early diagnosis, timely initiation of treatment, effective management of comorbidities, and personalized dosing strategies to improve patient outcomes. Future studies should aim to incorporate clinical verification of electronic data to further enhance the reliability and applicability of these findings.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder causing severe disability and cognitive impairment as the disease progresses. It is necessary to develop biomarkers for cognitive decline in PD for earlier detection and prediction of disease progression.\nWe reviewed literature which used artificial intelligence-based techniques, which can be more sensitive than other analyses, to determine potential biomarkers for cognitive impairment in PD.\nWe found that combining biomarker types, including those from neuroimaging and biofluids, resulted in higher accuracy. Focused analysis on each biomarker type revealed that using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) resulted in accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) values above 80%/0.80, and that beta-amyloid-42 and tau were able to classify PD subjects by cognitive function with accuracy and AUC values above 90%/0.90.\nWe can conclude that applying both blood-based and imaging-based biomarkers may improve diagnostic accuracy and prediction of cognitive impairment in PD.",

    "abstract": "Lithospermic acid (LA) is a water-soluble phenolic acid compound extracted and separated from the dried root and the rhizome of Salviamiltiorrhiza Bge (Labiatae), possessing multiple biological activities. Firstly, in terms of pharmacological activities, LA has been proven to possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, autophagy activation, and antiapoptotic properties. Secondly, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of LA show rapid and extensive distribution in various tissues after intravenous administration, followed by rapid elimination and excretion. Additionally, potential therapeutic effects of LA have been found in various diseases such as thrombosis, Parkinson's disease, hepatitis B, diabetes, and psoriasis, among others. Particularly, LA has shown promising prospects in the treatment of clinical heart diseases and has been included in new drug formulations for the treatment of chronic angina, demonstrating superior efficacy compared to current cardiovascular drugs. In conclusion, this review comprehensively introduces the pharmacological mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, and protective effects in diseases of LA. These information can lay a theoretical foundation for the future development and new clinical applications of LA.",

    "abstract": "Macroautophagy/autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis by degrading cytoplasmic components and its disruption is linked to Parkinson disease (PD), which is characterized by dopamine depletion and the accumulation of SNCA/\u03b1-synuclein aggregates in neurons. Therefore, activation of autophagy is considered a therapeutic strategy for PD; however, autophagy inducers have not yet been developed as therapeutic drugs because they are involved in a wide range of signaling pathways. Here, we focused on the lysosomal clustering around the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) that can regulate the process of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, the final step of autophagy, and examined how lysosomal clustering affects protein degradation through autophagy. Our study identified six compounds from a high-content screen of 1,200 clinically approved drugs that induce both lysosomal clustering and autophagy. Notably, albendazole reduced SNCA aggregates in a PD model by lysosomal clustering and autophagy. These findings suggest that targeting lysosomal clustering could offer new therapeutic insights for PD.",

    "abstract": "Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) encompasses a group of refractory neurodegenerative diseases that are caused by excessive iron deposition in the brain, especially in the basal ganglia. We reported a case of BPAN with a novel variant of the WDR45 gene at Xp11.23. Our patient was a 31-year-old woman who has had an intellectual disability since childhood. Approximately 3 years ago, she developed asymmetric parkinsonism affecting the distal right upper and lower limbs. Consistent with her neurological findings, dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography demonstrated the differences between the left and right sides. She was diagnosed as BPAN according to genetic analysis, which showed a novel heterozygous variant (c.345-3C>G) in WDR45. To the best of our knowledge, only a few previous case reports on asymmetric BPAN have described the quantitative differences in neuroimaging parameters between the left and right sides. These neuroimaging features were similar to those of Parkinson's disease, among the other neurodegenerative diseases. Our report may provide clues to elucidate the pathological mechanism of BPAN which is a refractory neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly people. The incidence of PD is increasing year by year, which seriously affects the patients' quality of life. Oxidative stress (OS) is one of the pathogeneses of PD. In recent years, with the deepening of research, it has been found that OS is closely related to other PD-related pathogenesis, such as the susceptibility of substantia nigra, mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal folding of \u03b1 -synuclein (\u03b1 -Syn), nitric oxide (NO) increasing, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), decreased antioxidant capacity, etc., which is considered to be the central link of the complex convergence of various pathogenesis. A large number of studies also have shown that acupuncture has great potential in regulating OS and treatment of PD. In the present article, we reviewed the role of OS in PD pathology and the mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of PD by improving OS in recent years\uff1a 1) acupuncture acts on Parkinson's disease by increasing antioxidant enzyme levels, 2) acupuncture works in Parkinson's disease by improving pathways related to OS (Nrf2/ARE, PI3K/Akt), 3) acupuncture acts on Parkinson's disease by improving OS-related neuroinflammation, and 4) acupuncture acts on Parkinson's disease by improving the cerebral-intestinal axis associated oxidative stress.\n\u6c27\u5316\u5e94\u6fc0\uff08OS\uff09\u662f\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\uff08PD\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0cOS\u4e0ePD\u5176\u4ed6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u4e5f\u8054\u7cfb\u5bc6\u5207\uff0c\u5982\u9ed1\u8d28\u7684\u6613\u611f\u6027\u3001\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u529f\u80fd\u969c\u788d\u3001\u03b1-\u7a81\u89e6\u6838\u86cb\u767d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6298\u53e0\u3001\u4e00\u6c27\u5316\u6c2e\u6d53\u5ea6\u5347\u9ad8\u3001\u5185\u8d28\u7f51\u5e94\u6fc0\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u5f02\u5e38\u8868\u8fbe\u3001\u6297\u6c27\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\uff0c\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u5404\u79cd\u53d1\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u590d\u6742\u6c47\u805a\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u73af\u8282\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5bf9OS\u5728PD\u53d1\u751f\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u6709\u5173\u9488\u523a\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u5584OS\u6cbb\u7597PD\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u505a\u4e00\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002\u9488\u523a\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u6297\u6c27\u5316\u9176\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u8c03\u8282\u6c27\u5316\u5e94\u6fc0\u76f8\u5173\u901a\u8def\u3001\u6539\u5584\u795e\u7ecf\u708e\u6027\u53cd\u5e94\u3001\u8c03\u63a7\u8111\u80a0\u8f74\u8c03\u63a7OS\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6cbb\u7597PD\u3002.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa (L-dopa) therapy is the most effective pharmacological treatment for motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its effect on brain functional network dynamics is still unclear. Here, we recruited 26 PD patients and 24 healthy controls, and acquired their resting-state functional MRI data before (PD-OFF) and after (PD-ON) receiving 400\u00a0mg\u00a0L-dopa. Using the independent component analysis and the sliding-window approach, we estimated the dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) and examined the effect of L-dopa on the temporal properties of dFC states, the variability of dFC and functional network topological organization. We found that PD-ON showed decreased mean dwell time in sparsely connected State 2 than PD-OFF, the transformation of the dFC state is more frequent and the variability of dFC was decreased within the auditory network and sensorimotor network in PD-ON. Our findings provide new insights to understand the dynamic neural activity induced by L-dopa therapy in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are sequences in the human genome that originated from infections with ancient retroviruses during our evolution. Previous studies have linked HERVs to neurodegenerative diseases, but defining their role in aetiology has been challenging. Here, we used a retrotranscriptome-wide association study (rTWAS) approach to assess the relationships between genetic risk for neurodegenerative diseases and HERV expression in the brain, calculated with genomic precision.\nWe analysed genetic association statistics pertaining to Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease, using HERV expression models calculated from 792 cortical samples. Robust risk factors were considered those that survived multiple testing correction in the primary analysis, which were also significant in conditional and joint analyses, and that had a posterior inclusion probability above 0.5 in fine-mapping analyses.\nThe primary analysis identified 12 HERV expression signatures associated with neurodegenerative disease susceptibility. We found one HERV expression signature robustly associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis on chromosome 12q14 (MER61_12q14.2) and one robustly associated with multiple sclerosis on chromosome 1p36 (ERVLE_1p36.32a). A co-expression analysis suggested that these HERVs are involved in homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules.\nWe found HERV expression profiles robustly associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis susceptibility, highlighting novel risk mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disease, and offering potential new targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "From a game of darts to neurorehabilitation, the ability to explore and fine tune our movements is critical for success. Past work has shown that exploratory motor behaviour in response to reinforcement (reward) feedback is closely linked with the basal ganglia, while movement corrections in response to error feedback is commonly attributed to the cerebellum. While our past work has shown these processes are dissociable during adaptation, it is unknown how they uniquely impact exploratory behaviour. Moreover, converging neuroanatomical evidence shows direct and indirect connections between the basal ganglia and cerebellum, suggesting that there is an interaction between reinforcement-based and error-based neural processes. Here we examine the unique roles and interaction between reinforcement-based and error-based processes on sensorimotor exploration in a neurotypical population. We also recruited individuals with Parkinson's disease to gain mechanistic insight into the role of the basal ganglia and associated reinforcement pathways in sensorimotor exploration. Across three reaching experiments, participants were given either reinforcement feedback, error feedback, or simultaneously both reinforcement & error feedback during a sensorimotor task that encouraged exploration. Our reaching results, a re-analysis of a previous gait experiment, and our model suggests that in isolation, reinforcement-based and error-based processes respectively boost and suppress exploration. When acting in concert, we found that reinforcement-based and error-based processes interact by mutually opposing one another. Finally, we found that those with Parkinson's disease had decreased exploration when receiving reinforcement feedback, supporting the notion that compromised reinforcement-based processes reduces the ability to explore new motor actions. Understanding the unique and interacting roles of reinforcement-based and error-based processes may help to inform neurorehabilitation paradigms where it is important to discover new and successful motor actions.",

    "abstract": "Neural circuits consisting of neurons and glial cells help to establish all functions of the CNS. Microglia, the resident immunocytes of the CNS, are endowed with UDP-sensitive P2Y6 receptors (P2Y6Rs) which regulate phagocytosis/pruning of excessive synapses during individual development and refine synapses in an activity-dependent manner during adulthood. In addition, this type of receptor plays a decisive role in primary (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, neuropathic pain) and secondary (epilepsy, ischemic-, mechanical-, or irradiation-induced) neurodegeneration. A whole range of microglial cytokines controlled by P2Y6Rs, such as the interleukins IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), leads to neuroinflammation, resulting in neurodegeneration. Hence, small molecular antagonists of P2Y6Rs and genetic knockdown of this receptor provide feasible ways to alleviate inflammation-induced neurological disorders but might also interfere with the regulation of the synaptic circuitry. The present review aims at investigating this dual role of P2Y6Rs in microglia, both in shaping neural circuits by targeted phagocytosis and promoting neurodegenerative illnesses by fostering neuroinflammation through multiple transduction mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Repurposing drugs for neurodegenerative diseases using the nose-to-brain route of administration is an intriguing concept with potential benefits. The nose-to-brain route involves delivering drugs directly to the brain via the olfactory or trigeminal pathways, bypassing the blood-brain barrier, which can improve drug efficacy and reduce systemic side effects. Treatment of numerous neurodegenerative diseases such as Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases has been attempted using this route of administration. These drugs may include neuroprotective agents, anti-inflammatory drugs, antioxidants, or diseasemodifying therapies. Nanotheranostics, which integrates therapeutic and diagnostic functions in a nanosystem, improves treatment precision and efficacy. Repurposing nanotherapeutics as nanotheranostics for neurodegenerative diseases through the nose-to-brain route of administration holds great potential for both diagnosis and treatment. This review highlights the various mechanisms engaged in transporting nanocarriers from nose-to-brain and the proposed fate of these nanocarriers using different live imaging techniques. Additionally, the discussion covers the recent combinatorial therapeutic approaches and theranostic applications of various nanocarriers used for neurodegenerative diseases through the nose-to-brain. Toxicity to the CNS and nasal mucosa and regulatory considerations about these delivery systems are also deliberated. Overall, repurposed nanoparticles designed as nanotheranostic agents offer a versatile platform for precise diagnosis, targeted therapy, and personalized management of neurodegenerative diseases, holding great promise for improving patient care and advancing our understanding of these complex disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by the deterioration of dopamine-producing neurons, resulting in motor impairments like tremors and rigidity. While the precise cause remains elusive, genetic and environmental factors are implicated. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and protein misfolding contribute to the disease's pathology. Current therapeutics primarily aim at symptom alleviation, employing dopamine replacement and deep brain stimulation. However, the quest for disease-modifying treatments persists. Ongoing clinical trials explore novel approaches, such as neuroprotective agents and gene therapies, reflecting the evolving PD research landscape. This review provides a comprehensive overview of PD, covering its basics, causal factors, major pathways, existing treatments, and a nuanced exploration of ongoing clinical trials. As the scientific community strives to unravel PD's complexities, this review offers insights into the multifaceted strategies pursued for a better understanding and enhanced management of this debilitating condition.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder that impacts various systems, including the substantia nigra (SN) par compacta (SNpc) and extranigral regions like the spinal cord. The presence of persistent inflammation in the SN and spinal cord is associated with movement difficulties in PD. Atractylenolide-I (ATR-I) is a natural sesquiterpene recognized for its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. This research aimed to assess the impact of ATR-I treatment on motor function and inflammation in MPTP-induced subacute PD mice, particularly focusing on the role of ATR-I in spinal cord inflammation.\nThe motor functions of the mice were assessed using suspension and gait tests. Dopaminergic neuronal loss in the SNpc and microglial activation in both the SNpc and spinal cord were evaluated through immunofluorescence staining. The levels of inflammatory mediators in the spinal cord were measured using RT-qPCR analysis. The expressions of SIRT1 and PGC-1\u03b1 in the spinal cord were analyzed through Western blotting and RT-qPCR.\nATR-I treatment improved motor deficits in MPTP-induced mice. Moreover, ATR-I reduced the loss of dopamine neurons and microglial activation in the SNpc of MPTP-induced mice. Additionally, ATR-I suppressed spinal cord inflammation by decreasing microglial activation and the mRNA expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and iNOS in MPTP-induced mice. Interestingly, ATR-I also upregulated SIRT1 and PGC-1\u03b1 levels in the spinal cord of MPTP-induced mice.\nThese findings suggest that ATR-I exhibits anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in PD. The attenuation of spinal cord inflammation via the SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1 pathway may contribute to enhancing motor function, highlighting ATR-I as a potential therapeutic avenue for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex multisystem disorder clinically characterized by motor, non-motor, and premotor manifestations. Pathologically, PD involves neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, striatal dopamine deficiency, and accumulation of intracellular inclusions containing aggregates of \u03b1-synuclein. Recent studies demonstrate that PD is associated with dysregulated metabolic flux through the kynurenine pathway (KP), in which tryptophan is converted to kynurenine (KYN), and KYN is subsequently metabolized to neuroactive compounds quinolinic acid (QA) and kynurenic acid (KA). This multicenter study used highly sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass-spectrometry to compare blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) KP metabolites between 158 unimpaired older adults and 177 participants with PD. Results indicate that increased neuroexcitatory QA/KA ratio in both plasma and CSF of PD participants associated with peripheral and cerebral inflammation and vitamin B6 deficiency. Furthermore, increased QA tracked with CSF tau and severity of both motor and non-motor PD clinical dysfunction. Importantly, plasma and CSF kynurenine metabolites classified PD participants with a high degree of accuracy (AUC = 0.897). Finally, analysis of metabolite data revealed subgroups with distinct KP profiles, and these were subsequently found to display distinct PD clinical features. Together, these data further support the hypothesis that the KP serves as a site of brain and periphery crosstalk, integrating B-vitamin status, inflammation and metabolism to ultimately influence PD clinical manifestation.",

    "abstract": "Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is a complex of symptoms and signs comprising limb rigidity, bradykinesia, dystonia, myoclonus, apraxia, cortical sensory loss, and a variety of cognitive and language impairments. CBS is commonly seen in tauopathies. Striking asymmetry in clinical and imaging findings in CBS raises questions about potential triggers initiating neurodegeneration. The objective of this study was to investigate potential central or peripheral triggers preceding CBS symptoms.\nIn this retrospective observational study, we reviewed medical records of patients with CBS at our Parkinson's Disease Center and Movement Disorders Clinic, focusing on evidence of possible central or peripheral \"trigger\" occurring within a year before the onset of CBS. We also reviewed records of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) for comparison.\nOf the 72 patients with CBS, 15 (20.8%) reported potential focal triggers before the onset of CBS-related neurologic symptoms. By contrast, only 1 of 72 patients with PD (1.4%) had a documented trigger before the onset of PD-related symptoms (\nOur finding of relatively high frequency of focal triggers in CBS compared with PD suggests potential central or peripheral triggers initiating neurodegeneration, possibly explaining asymmetric clinical and imaging features in CBS. Further research is necessary to validate and explore this observation's implications for CBS pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Few estimates of the long-term health system costs of Parkinson disease by phase of disease are available. We estimated 10-year and phase-based net health system costs of Parkinson disease before and after case ascertainment.\nUsing population-based linked administrative databases from Ontario, Canada, we identified 43,149 community-dwelling persons with incident Parkinson disease aged 40 years and older between 2009 and 2018 using a validated algorithm. These individuals were matched 1:1 to controls without Parkinson disease based on demographics and a propensity score. We calculated phase-based, net health system costs from the provincial government perspective during the preascertainment (3 years before index), initial (1 year after index), early continuing (>1-6 years after index), later continuing (>6-10 years after index), and terminal (1 year before death, if applicable) phases (standardized to 2020 $CAD and calculated on an annual basis). By applying survival probabilities to monthly cost estimates, we also determined 10-year net health system costs, stratified by sex and age.\nAnnual mean net costs of Parkinson disease were lowest in the preascertainment phase ($212 CAD, 95% CI [$20-$404]), intermediate in the initial phase ($4,576 (95% CI [$4,217-$4,935]), and higher in the early continuing phase ($7,078, 95% CI [$6,717-$7,438]). The later continuing phase ($12,500, 95% CI [$12,060-$12,940]) and the terminal phase ($13,933, 95% CI [$13,123-$14,743]) showed the highest costs. The 10-year net cost of Parkinson disease was $82,153 (95% CI [$77,965-$86,341]) and was significantly higher in women ($89,773, 95% CI [$83,306-$96,240]) than in men ($76,469, 95% CI [$70,983-$81,953]) and older individuals ($92,197, 95% CI [$87,087-$97,307]), compared with younger individuals ($62,580, 95% CI [$55,346-$69,814]). Over the 10-year period, hospital, nursing home, and home care were the largest contributors to costs of Parkinson disease.\nHealth system costs of Parkinson disease are substantial, particularly in the later phases. Interventions to reduce avoidable use of hospital and nursing home services by persons living with Parkinson disease may provide better quality of life and be cost saving from the health system perspective.",

The preoperative evaluation, including imaging and frame placement, is detailed. The surgical procedure involves meticulous targeting and trajectory planning. Intraoperative stimulation is utilized for motor response assessment. Two temporary lesioning phases precede the final procedure at 75\u00b0C. The postoperative CT scan highlights the lesion site. Immediate tremor relief is observed postoperatively, with the effect persisting at the 1-month follow-up. Supporting readings underscore the efficacy and safety of CZi for tremor management.

We aimed to determine the impact of atrial fibrillation and/or flutter (AF/AFL) on adverse cardiac outcomes and mortality in patients with WPW syndrome.\nThis study identified a cohort of Military Health System patients with WPW syndrome from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2019. The cohort was divided into 2 subgroups by the presence or absence of AF/AFL. Cardiac composite outcome and mortality were assessed. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to assess the bivariate association between exposure and these 2 study outcomes. Cox proportional models were used to estimate the hazard ratios and 95% CIs associated with the cardiac composite outcome and mortality.\nOf 35,539 patients included in the study, 19,961 were female (56.2%), the mean (SD) age was 62.9 (18.0) years, and 5291 patients (14.9%) had AF/AFL. The cardiac composite outcome and mortality incidence rates per 100 person-years in the AF/AFL vs non-AF/AFL subgroups were 8.18 vs 4.90, and 4.09 vs 2.13, respectively (\nPatients with WPW syndrome and AF/AFL have a higher association with adverse cardiac outcomes and death.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a growing public health challenge associated with the aging population. Current diagnostic methods rely on motor symptoms and invasive procedures, making early detection difficult. This study established a transferable artificial intelligence (AI) model, Quest2Dx, to analyze health questionnaires to enable low-cost and non-invasive PD diagnosis. Quest2Dx tackles the common challenges of missing responses and required specific modeling for each questionnaire by developing a novel language modeling approach to allow the model transfer across different questionnaires and to enhance the interpretability. Evaluated on the PPMI and Fox Insight datasets, Quest2Dx achieved AUROCs of 0.977 and 0.974, respectively, significantly outperforming existing methods. Additionally, cross-questionnaire validation achieved AUROCs of 0.920 and 0.952, respectively, from PPMI to Fox Insight and vice versa. Quest2Dx also identified key predictors from the list of questions to provide further insights. The validated technology elucidates a promising path for PD screening in primary-care settings.",

    "abstract": "Although deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) induces motor benefits in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD), the size and duration of the effects of STN-DBS on motor axial (e.g., postural instability, trunk posture alterations) and gait impairments (e.g., freezing of gait - FOG) are still ambiguous. Physical therapy (PT) effectively complements pharmacological treatment to improve postural stability, gait performance, and other dopamine-resistant symptoms (e.g. festination, hesitation, axial motor dysfunctions, and FOG) in PwPD who are non-surgically treated. Despite the potential for positive adjuvant effects of PT following STN-DBS surgery, there is a paucity of science available on the topic. In such a scenario, gathering the opinion and expertise of leading investigators worldwide was pursued to study motor rehabilitation in PwPD following STN-DBS. After summarizing the few available findings through a systematic review, we identified clinical and academically experienced DBS clinicians (n=21) to discuss the challenges related to PT following STN-DBS. A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire was used and based on the results of the systematic review along with a Delphi method. Thirty-nine questions were submitted to the panel - half related to general considerations on PT following STN-DBS, half related to PT treatments. Despite the low-to-moderate quality, the few available rehabilitative studies suggested that PT could improve dynamic and static balance, gait performance and posture. Similarly, panellists strongly agreed that PT might help in improving motor symptoms and quality of life, and it may be possibly prescribed to maximize the effects of the stimulation. The experts agreed that physical therapists could be part of the multidisciplinary team taking care of the patients. Also, they agreed on prescribing of conventional PT, but not massage or manual therapy. Our results will inform the rehabilitation and the DBS community to engage, publish and deepen this area of research. Such efforts may spark guidelines for PT following STN-DBS.",

We present the clinical features, genetic testing - whole exome sequencing (WES), and neuropathological findings. The functional consequences of this aSyn variant were extensively investigated using biochemical, biophysical, and cellular assays.\nThe patient exhibited a complex neurodegenerative disease that included generalized myocloni, bradykinesia, dystonia of the left arm and apraxia. WES identified a novel heterozygous \nThe atypical neuropathological features observed, which are reminiscent of those observed for the G51D aSyn variant, suggest a causal role of the ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects millions globally, impacting movement. Prior research utilized deep learning for PD prediction, primarily focusing on medical images, neglecting the data's underlying manifold structure. This work proposes a multimodal approach encompassing both image and non-image features, leveraging contrastive cross-view graph fusion for PD classification. We introduce a novel multimodal co-attention module, integrating embeddings from separate graph views derived from low-dimensional representations of images and clinical features. This enables more robust and structured feature extraction for improved multi-view data analysis. Additionally, a simplified contrastive loss-based fusion method is devised to enhance cross-view fusion learning. Our graph-view multimodal approach achieves an accuracy of 91% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 92.8% in five-fold cross-validation. It also demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on non-image data compared to solely machine learning-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) have a higher susceptibility to aging-related degeneration, compared to midbrain dopaminergic cells present in the ventral tegmental area (VTA); the death of dopamine neurons in the SNc results in Parkinson\u00b4s disease (PD). In addition to increased loss by aging, dopaminergic neurons from the SNc are more prone to cell death when exposed to genetic or environmental factors, that either interfere with mitochondrial function, or cause an increase of oxidative stress. The oxidation of dopamine is a contributing source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but this production is not enough to explain the differences in susceptibility to degeneration between SNc and VTA neurons.\nIn this review we aim to highlight the intrinsic differences between SNc and VTA dopamine neurons, in terms of gene expression, calcium oscillations, bioenergetics, and ROS responses. Also, to describe the changes in the pentose phosphate pathway and the induction of apoptosis in SNc neurons during aging, as related to the development of PD.\nRecent work showed that neurons from the SNc possess intrinsic characteristics that result in metabolic differences, related to their intricate morphology, that render them more susceptible to degeneration. In particular, these neurons have an elevated basal energy metabolism, that is required to fulfill the demands of the constant firing of action potentials, but at the same time, is associated to higher ROS production, compared to VTA cells. Finally, we discuss how mutations related to PD affect metabolic pathways, and the related mechanisms, as revealed by metabolomics.",

    "abstract": "S100A8 (MRP8) and S100A9 (MRP14) are critical mediators of the inflammatory response; they are usually present as heterodimers because of the instability of homodimers. Studies have demonstrated that S100A8/A9 expression is significantly upregulated in several central nervous system (CNS) diseases. S100A8/A9 is actively released by neutrophils and monocytes; it plays a key role in regulating the inflammatory response by stimulating leukocyte recruitment and inducing cytokine secretion during inflammation. Additionally, S100A8/A9 can be used as a diagnostic biomarker for several CNS diseases and as a predictor of therapeutic response to inflammation-related diseases. In this work, we reviewed our current understanding of S100A8/A9 overexpression in inflammation and its importance in the development and progression of CNS inflammatory diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and stroke, and the functional roles and therapeutic applications of S100A8/A9 in these diseases. Finally, we discussed the current barriers and future research directions of S100A8/A9 in CNS diseases.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation serves as a critical pathological marker in a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including the formation of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) and Tau neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease, as well as \u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) aggregates in Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease-related dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). A significant proportion of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) exhibit TDP-43 aggregates. Moreover, a confluence of brain protein pathologies, such as A\u03b2, Tau, \u03b1-Syn, and TDP-43, has been identified in individual NDs cases, highlighting the intricate interplay among these proteins that is garnering heightened scrutiny. Importantly, protein aggregation is modulated by an array of factors, with burgeoning evidence suggesting that it frequently results from perturbations in protein homeostasis, influenced by the cellular membrane milieu, metal ion concentrations, post-translational modifications, and genetic mutations. This review delves into the pathological underpinnings of protein aggregation across various NDs and elucidates the intercommunication among disparate proteins within the same disease context. Additionally, we examine the pathogenic mechanisms by which diverse factors impinge upon protein aggregation, offering fresh perspectives for the future therapeutic intervention of NDs.",

    "abstract": "The structure, process and outcome (SPO) framework has been used to establish that improved structures of care influences an enhanced process of stroke care resulting in improved outcome. Although, both stroke and Parkinson's disease (PD) are neurological conditions that require prolonged period of care and rehabilitation, the SPO framework has not yet been used to describe the existing structures and processes of PD care and rehabilitation in Ghana.\nTo describe the current structures and processes of PD rehabilitation across the three healthcare levels (primary, secondary and tertiary) in the southern sector of Ghana.\nAn online cross-sectional descriptive survey design was used via REDCap. Fifty-two therapists, including department heads, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists from seven healthcare facilities were purposefully sampled and invited to complete the survey on structures and processes of PD rehabilitation. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v29.0. Comparative analysis was performed using Pearson's chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis test (H-test) as appropriate. Statistical significance was set at p\u2009<\u20090.05.\nForty-nine (94.2%) responses were received and four incomplete responses were excluded from analysis. Structure of rehabilitation: Most of the participants were physiotherapists (n\u2009=\u200936/45; 80.0%) and tertiary level professionals (n\u2009=\u200931/45; 68.9%). Only physiotherapy service was available across all the healthcare levels. Persons with PD were mostly referred for rehabilitation at Hoehn and Yahr stage III as reported by 55.6% (n\u2009=\u200920/36) of the therapists. Process of rehabilitation: Most therapists treated persons with PD two times weekly (n\u2009=\u200919/33; 57.6%) and on individual basis (n\u2009=\u200929/33; 87.9%). Only 9 (27.2%) and 7 (21.2%) therapists often used clinical guidelines or outcome measures respectively in managing PD and 93.9% of the therapists had no local protocols.\nThe structures and processes needed for PD rehabilitation exist but differ across the healthcare levels and among therapists. Physiotherapy was the most common rehabilitation service available at all levels of healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) resulting from inherited glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) deficiency. GD diagnosis relies on GBA1 activity assays, typically employing 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (4MU-\u03b2-Glc) as fluorogenic substrate. However, these assays suffer from background 4MU release by the non-lysosomal GBA2 and cytosolic GBA3 enzymes. Here we developed GBA1-selective fluorogenic substrates by synthesizing a series of 6-O-acyl-4MU-\u03b2-Glc substrates with diverse fatty acid tails. Because of chemical and enzymatic instability of the ester bonds, analogues of 6-O-palmitoyl-4MU-\u03b2-Glc (3) with different chemical linkages were synthesized. 6-O-alkyl-4MU-\u03b2-Glc 9, featuring an ether linkage, emerged as the most optimal GBA1 substrate, exhibiting both a low K",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, the greatest promise for treating severe and currently incurable systemic and neurodegenerative diseases has turned to agents capable of effectively degrading pathological amyloid deposits without causing side effects. Specifically, amyloid destruction observed in immunotherapy is hypothesized to occur through activation of proteolytic enzymes. This study examines poorly understood effects of an immune enzyme, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), on amyloids associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, lysozyme, insulin, and dialysis-related amyloidoses. The study establishes the universality of MMP9's effect on various amyloids, with its efficacy largely depending on the fibrillar cluster size. Irreversible amyloid degradation by MMP9 is attributed to the destruction of intramolecular interactions rather than intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the fibril backbone. This process results in the loss of ordered fiber structure without reducing aggregate size or increasing cytotoxicity. Thus, MMP9 can mitigate side effects of anti-amyloid therapy associated with the formation of low-molecular-weight degradation products that may accelerate fibrillogenesis and amyloid propagation between tissues and organs. MMP9 shows promise as a component of safe anti-amyloid drugs by enhancing the accessibility of binding sites through \"loosening\" amyloid clusters, which facilitates subsequent fragmentation and monomerization by other enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Brain health is intimately connected to fluid flow dynamics that cleanse the brain of potentially harmful waste material. This system is regulated by vascular dynamics, the maintenance of perivascular spaces, neural activity during sleep, and lymphatic drainage in the meningeal layers. However, aging can impinge on each of these layers of regulation, leading to impaired brain cleansing and the emergence of various age-associated neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Understanding the intricacies of fluid flow regulation in the brain and how this becomes altered with age could reveal new targets and therapeutic strategies to tackle age-associated neurological decline.",

    "abstract": "High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) allows non-invasive analysis of motor unit (MU) activity and recruitment. This study examines MU recruitment features as well as action potential using HD-sEMG in the suprahyoid muscles of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and assesses alterations caused by cervical percutaneous interferential current stimulation.\nElectrical activity of the suprahyoid muscles during tongue elevation was measured using HD-sEMG. Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was measured, then the modified entropy, coefficient of variation, correlation coefficient, and root mean square (RMS) were examined. For comparison, HD-sEMG was also conducted on healthy controls. In addition, this study assessed the impact of cervical percutaneous interferential current stimulation on HD-sEMG in patients with PD (Hoehn-Yahr stages 2-4) over 8\u00a0weeks.\nTwenty-two patients with PD (mean age 71.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.0, 7 females) and 14 healthy controls (mean age 74.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1, 7 females) were included. The RMS at 60\u00a0% MVC was significantly lower in patients with PD than in healthy controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). After cervical percutaneous interferential current stimulation, the correlation coefficients at 40\u00a0% and 60\u00a0% MVC significantly decreased (p\u00a0=\u00a00.040 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.048, respectively), and the RMS at 60\u00a0% MVC significantly increased (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035).\nHD-sEMG of the suprahyoid muscles showed characteristic findings in patients with PD and was able to detect subtle changes due to electrical stimulation intervention. Thus, HD-sEMG could be a promising tool for evaluating swallowing-related muscle conditions and interventions.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease is a highly complicated neurological disorder, with a key manifestation of loss of dopaminergic neurons. Despite the plethora of medicines that alleviate the symptoms, there is an urgent need for new treatments acting on the fundamental pathology of PD. Non-coding RNAs are becoming increasingly important in gene regulation and various cellular processes and are found to play a role in PD pathophysiology. This review analyzes the cross-talk of distinct ncRNAs with dopamine signaling. We attempt to constrain the various ncRNA networks that can activate dopamine production. First, we describe the deregulation of miRNAs that target dopamine receptors and have been implicated in PD. Next, we turn to the functions of lncRNAs in dopaminergic neurons and the connections to susceptibility genes for PD. Finally, we will analyze the novel circRNAs, such as ciRS-7, which may modulate dopamine-linked processes and serve as possible PD biomarkers. In this review, we describe recent progress in dopamine neuron revival to treat PD and the therapeutic potential of ncRNA. This review critically evaluates the available data, and we predict the role of some ncRNAs, such as PTBP1, to become candidate treatment targets in the future. Thus, this review aims to summarize the molecular causes for the deficit in dopamine signaling in PD and point to novel ncRNAs-linked therapeutic directions in neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic (DAnergic) dysfunction and imbalanced dopamine (DA) levels are known contributors to the pathogenesis of numerous psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Of the many identified risk factors for DA-associated disorders, nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A2 (NR4A2; or nuclear receptor related-1 protein (NURR1)), a transcription factor involved in DAnergic differentiation, has been associated with Parkinson's disease and attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). In zebrafish, transient loss of nr4a2 was previously shown to decrease tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and impair locomotion. To further characterize the roles of the two zebrafish nr4a2 paralogs, nr4a2a, and nr4a2b, we produced targeted loss-of-function mutants and examined DAnergic neuron regeneration, oxidative respiration, and behavioral traits. The loss of nr4a2a function more closely recapitulated Parkinsonian phenotypes and affected neurotrophic factor gene expression. Conversely, nr4a2b mutants displayed behavioral symptoms reminiscent of mice deficient in Nr4a2 with increased neurotrophic output. In contrast, nr4a2b mutants also displayed increased metabolic input from non-mitochondrial sources indicative of high cytosolic reactive oxygen species and perturbed mitochondrial function. The nr4a2a mutants also showed increased maximal respiration, which may suggest a compensatory mechanism to meet the metabolic requirements of DAnergic neuron health. Overall, the zebrafish mutants generated in this study helped uncover molecular mechanisms involved in DA-related disease pathologies, and in the regeneration of DAnergic neurons.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a non-motor symptom of Parkinson's Disease, affecting 75-95% of the patients. This symptom usually emerges before the clinical diagnosis, and patients with OD present with more severe forms of PD and need higher doses of therapy. It remains unknown whether OD is just a mere non-motor symptom or if it is a part of a series of pathological changes in different brain regions of the affected patients. We performed a systematic review to find the microstructural correlates of OD in people with PD. The systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science yielded ten eligible studies. Assessments in most included studies were inconclusive. However, we found variable brain regions and tracts associated with OD. The most repeated areas included the primary olfactory cortex, gyrus rectus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, corticospinal tract, uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, and cerebellar peduncle. Despite some limitations, we pointed out the microstructural correlates of OD, which were also present in areas other than the olfactory system. These findings imply that OD might be a manifestation of an unknown, greater pathology in the brain of patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) m.3243A>G mutation is one of the most common pathogenic mtDNA variants. The phenotypes associated with this mutation range from asymptomatic induviduals to well-defined clinical syndromes, or non-syndromic mitochondrial disorders. Variable clinical features in pediatric cases may cause difficulty in diagnosis. Kidney involvement in this mutation is uncommon and reported on a case-by-case basis. Here, we report on a patient with m.3243A>G mutation, who presented with short stature and proteinuria, and his family, who share the same genotype but exhibit different heteroplasmy levels in different tissues and variable phenotypes.\nA 15-year-old male patient was admitted to the pediatric endocrinology department with short stature. His examinations revealed nephrotic range proteinuria, hearing loss, impaired glucose tolerance, and Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome. From family history, it was learned that diabetes mellitus (DM) and progressive sensorineural hearing loss were common in this family. The patient's mother, who had chronic kidney disease, DM, and hearing loss, had died suddenly for an unknown reason. Considering the family history, a genetic analysis was performed for mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed a m.3243A>G mutation with 47% heteroplasmy in blood, 62% heteroplasmy in buccal cells, and 96% heteroplasmy in urothelial cells in our patient.\nShort stature without any other complaint and renal involvement are rare findings in m.3243A>G mutation. In patients presenting with proteinuria, in the presence of conditions affecting many systems such as endocrine system pathologies, hearing loss, and cardiac pathologies, and in the presence of individuals with a similar family history of multiple organ involvement, mitochondrial diseases should be considered, and examined from this perspective. Our case illustrates the value of a detailed medical and family history.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus, with its complex subfields, is linked to numerous neuropsychiatric traits. While most research has focused on its global structure or a few specific subfields, a comprehensive analysis of hippocampal substructures and their genetic correlations across a wide range of neuropsychiatric traits remains underexplored. Given the hippocampus's high heritability, considering hippocampal and subfield volumes (HASV) as endophenotypes for neuropsychiatric conditions is essential.\nWe analyzed MRI-derived volumetric data of hippocampal and subfield structures from 41,525 UK Biobank participants. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on 24 HASV traits were conducted, followed by genetic correlation, overlap, and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses with 10 common neuropsychiatric traits. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on HASV traits were also evaluated for predicting these traits.\nOur analysis identified 352 independent genetic variants surpassing a significance threshold of 2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nThese findings highlight the extensive distribution of pleiotropic genetic determinants between HASVs and neuropsychiatric traits. Moreover, they suggest a significant potential for effectively managing and intervening in these diseases during their early stages.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder and results from the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Pink1 and Parkin are proteins that function together in mitochondrial quality control, and when they carry loss-of-function mutations lead to familial forms of PD. While much research has focused on central nervous system alterations in PD, peripheral contributions to PD pathogenesis are increasingly appreciated. We report Pink1/Parkin regulate glycolytic and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from rats. Pink1/Parkin deficiency induces changes in the circulating lymphocyte populations, namely increased CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells and decreased CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells and B cells. Loss of Pink1/Parkin leads to elevated platelet counts in the blood and increased platelet-T cell aggregation. Platelet-lymphocyte aggregates are associated with increased thrombosis risk suggesting targeting the Pink1/Parkin pathway in the periphery might have therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need to identify predictive biomarkers of Parkinson's disease (PD) with cognitive impairment (PDCI) in order to individualize patient management, ensure timely intervention, and improve prognosis. The aim of this study was to screen for these biomarkers by comparing the plasma proteome and metabolome of PD patients with or without cognitive impairment. Proteomics and metabolomics analyses were performed on a discover cohort. A machine learning model was used to identify candidate protein and metabolite biomarkers of PDCI, which were validated in an independent cohort. The predictive ability of these biomarkers for PDCI was evaluated by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Moreover, we assessed the predictive ability of these proteins in combination with neuroimaging. In the discover cohort (n\u2009=\u2009100), we identified 25 protein features with best results in the machine learning model, including top-ranked PSAP and H3C15. The two-proteins were used for model construction, achieving an Area under the curve (AUC) of 0.951 in the train set and AUC of 0.981 in the test set. Similarly, the model gives a rank list of endogenous metabolite features, Glycocholic Acid and 6-Methylnicotinamide were two top features. Combining these two markers further got the AUC of 0.969 in train set and 0.867 in the test set. To validate the performance of the protein biomarkers, we performed targeted analysis of selected proteins (H3C15 and PSAP) and proteins likely associated with PDCI (NCAM2 and LAMB2) using parallel reaction monitoring in validation cohort (n\u2009=\u2009116). The AUC of the classifier built with H3C15 and PSAP is 0.813. Moreover, when combining H3C15, PSAP, NCAM2, and LAMB2, the model achieved AUC of 0.983 in the train set, AUC of 0.981 in the test set, and AUC of 0.839 in the validation set. Furthermore, we verified that these protein markers we discovered can improve the predictive effect of neuroimaging on PDCI: the classifier built with neuroimaging features had AUC of 0.833, which improved to 0.905 when combined with H3C15. Taken together, our integrated proteomics and metabolomics analysis successfully identified potential biomarkers for PDCI. Additionally, H3C15 showed promise in enhancing the predictive performance of neuroimaging for cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "One key limitation in developing effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of models accurately mimicking the complex physiopathology of the human disease. Humans accumulate with age the pigment neuromelanin inside neurons that synthesize catecholamines. Neurons reaching the highest neuromelanin levels preferentially degenerate in Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and apparently healthy aging individuals. However, this brain pigment is not taken into consideration in current animal models because common laboratory species, such as rodents, do not produce neuromelanin. Here we generate a tissue-specific transgenic mouse, termed tgNM, that mimics the human age-dependent brain-wide distribution of neuromelanin within catecholaminergic regions, based on the constitutive catecholamine-specific expression of human melanin-producing enzyme tyrosinase. We show that, in parallel to progressive human-like neuromelanin pigmentation, these animals display age-related neuronal dysfunction and degeneration affecting numerous brain circuits and body tissues, linked to motor and non-motor deficits, reminiscent of early neurodegenerative stages. This model could help explore new research avenues in brain aging and neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental and clinical data demonstrate a significant dysregulation of the gut microbiome in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). With an immense influence on all aspects of physiology, this dysregulation has potential to directly or indirectly contribute to disease pathology. Experimental models have bridged these associations toward defined contributions, identifying various microbiome-dependent impacts to PD pathology. These studies have laid the foundation for human translation, examining whether certain members of the microbiome and/or whole restoration of the gut microbiome community can provide therapeutic benefit for people living with PD. Here, we review recent and ongoing clinically-focused studies that use microbiome-targeted therapies to limit the severity and progression of PD. Fecal microbiome transplants, prebiotic interventions, and probiotic supplementation are each emerging as viable methodologies to augment the gut microbiome and potentially limit PD symptoms. While still early, the data in the field to date support continued cross-talk between experimental systems and human studies to identify key microbial factors that contribute to PD pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine system, resulting in progressive motor and nonmotor symptoms. Although most studies have focused on the basal ganglia network, recent evidence suggests that the zona incerta (ZI), a subthalamic structure composed of 4 neurochemically defined regions, is emerging as a therapeutic target in PD. This review summarizes the clinical and animal studies that indicate the importance of ZI in PD. Human clinical studies have shown that subthalamotomy or deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ZI alleviates muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, tremors and speech dysfunction in patients with PD. Researchers have also studied the impact of DBS of the ZI on nonmotor signs such as pain, anxiety, and depression. Animal studies combining optogenetics, chemogenetics, behavioral assays, and neural activity recordings reveal the functional roles of ZI GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in locomotion, gait, and coordination of the symptoms of PD, all of which are discussed in this review. Controversies and possible future studies are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Scientific research based on model organisms can help to understand the biology of Parkinson's Disease, the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Drosophila melanogaster mutant for the gene parkin, homologous to human's PARK2, exhibit well-characterized phenotypes including loss of dopaminergic neurons, lower survival and motor defects. Through the transcriptomic analysis of an exceptional case of reversible neurodegeneration in Drosophila, our group identified that the gene pretaporter, homologous to TXNDC5 of humans, was downregulated in the reversal phase. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the lack of expression of pretaporter will restrain phenotypes observed in Drosophila parkin mutants.\nAfter establishing by immunochemistry that Pretaporter is expressed in PPL1 dopaminergic neurons, we constructed pretaporter-parkin double mutants flies to investigate the hypothesis through immunohistochemistry, survival and climbing assays.\nIt was found that the loss-of-function mutation in pretaporter significatively restrains the phenotype caused by the loss-of-function mutation in parkin in several key aspects: it abolished the loss of PPL1 neurons normally seen in parkin mutant flies, promoted their survival in both sexes and reduced the decay in motor ability in parkin female flies. We propose that the absence of Pretaporter in parkin mutant flies prevents the death of dopaminergic neurons by rendering them resistant to Draper-mediated-phagocytosis.",

    "abstract": "While motor symptoms are the most well-known manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD), patients may also suffer from non-motor signs like cognitive impairments. The adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoRon (Adipo) has shown neuroprotective effects in preclinical studies. The objective of this study was to determine the potential benefits of chronic intranasal treatment of Adipo on motor function and cognitive performance in a hemiparkinsonian rat model caused by injecting 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the left forebrain bundle. After one week, PD rats were given either a vehicle or one of three dosages of Adipo (0.1, 1, and 10\u00a0\u03bcg) or levodopa (10\u00a0mg/kg orally) daily for 21 days. Recognition and spatial memory were determined using the novel object recognition test (NORT) and the Barnes maze test, respectively. The hippocampal tissues of the animals were harvested to examine oxidative stress status as well as the protein expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95). In hemiparkinsonian rats, motor impairments, recognition memory, and spatial memory were all improved by chronic intranasal Adipo at 1 and 10\u00a0\u03bcg. Furthermore, we found that unilateral 6-OHDA injection elevated hippocampal oxidative stress (ROS) while concurrently reducing total antioxidant capacity (TAC), BDNF, PSD-95, and antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx). However, Adipo 10\u00a0\u03bcg significantly reduced these biochemical alterations in the hippocampus of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Chronic intranasal Adipo ameliorated spatial and recognition memory deterioration in hemiparkinsonian rats, presumably by increasing hippocampal synaptic protein levels, reducing oxidative stress, and increasing BDNF.",

    "abstract": "According to Japanese law, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during the COVID-19 pandemic falls under Category 2, implying that it necessitates hospitalization, isolation, and significant government participation. The category of infection was lowered to Category 5 in May 2023, meaning that individuals were going back to live their lives as they did before the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore changes in the prevalence of non-motor symptoms over a longer four-year period, spanning before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe conducted a questionnaire survey between January and February in the following years: 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.\nThe Parkinson's fatigue scale score in 2021 (mean: 35.3) increased significantly in 2022 (49.84), 2023 (49.33), and 2024 (54.71) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). After adjusting for baseline score using a mixed linear model with random intercept, the Parkinson's fatigue scale was significantly increased by 15.9 points (95\u00a0% CI: 10.9 to 20.9) in 2022, 13.1 points (7.9-18.3) in 2023, and 16.9 points (11.3-22.6) in 2024 independently of all potential confounders including other non-motor symptoms.\nThe four years of longitudinal observation during the recurrent COVID-19 pandemic revealed that patients with PD experienced an increase in fatigue. Now, post-COVID-19 fatigue is attracting attention; however, the severity of fatigue may have already deteriorated during the period of recurrent COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Although neurodegenerative diseases are a leading cause of death, little is known about health care utilization and cost during the end-of-life (EoL) period or how it compares with that of other life-limiting conditions. We aimed to describe and compare resource utilization among US Medicare decedents with neurodegenerative diseases with decedents with cancer.\nWe conducted a retrospective study of Medicare Part A and B beneficiaries with Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who died in 2018. Decedents diagnosed with malignant brain tumors or pancreatic cancer served as non-neurodegenerative comparators. Descriptive analyses examined demographic and clinical characteristics in the last year of life. The probabilities and associated costs of emergency department (ED), inpatient, skilled nursing facility (SNF), and hospice utilization during the last 12 and 6 months of life were also compared between persons with neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, adjusting for sociodemographic factors and comorbidity burden.\nA total of 1,126,799 Medicare beneficiaries died in 2018, of which 357,926 had a qualifying diagnosis. Persons with neurodegenerative diseases were older and more frequently received Medicaid assistance than persons with brain or pancreatic cancer. In all groups, health care service utilization increased over the last year of life, and total costs were predominantly attributable to inpatient care. In the last 6 months of life, neurologist care was infrequent among patients with neurodegenerative disease (AD: 1.5%; PD: 8.6%; ALS: 32.0%). Persons with neurodegenerative diseases as compared to persons with malignant brain tumors also had greater odds of ED use (AD: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.17, 95% CI 1.11-1.23; PD: aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-1.25; ALS: aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.23), lower odds of hospitalization (AD: aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.60-0.68; PD: aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.61-0.69; ALS: aOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.30-0.37), and lower odds of hospice enrollment (AD: aOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.31-0.36; PD: aOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.31-0.36; ALS: aOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.36-0.46). The findings were similar in pancreatic cancer.\nPersons with neurodegenerative diseases in the United States are more likely to visit the ED and less likely to use inpatient and hospice services at EoL than persons with brain or pancreatic cancer. These group differences may stem from prognostic uncertainty and reflect inadequate EoL care practices, requiring further investigation to ensure more timely palliative care and hospice referrals.",

    "results": "A total of 1,126,799 Medicare beneficiaries died in 2018, of which 357,926 had a qualifying diagnosis. Persons with neurodegenerative diseases were older and more frequently received Medicaid assistance than persons with brain or pancreatic cancer. In all groups, health care service utilization increased over the last year of life, and total costs were predominantly attributable to inpatient care. In the last 6 months of life, neurologist care was infrequent among patients with neurodegenerative disease (AD: 1.5%; PD: 8.6%; ALS: 32.0%). Persons with neurodegenerative diseases as compared to persons with malignant brain tumors also had greater odds of ED use (AD: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.17, 95% CI 1.11-1.23; PD: aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-1.25; ALS: aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.23), lower odds of hospitalization (AD: aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.60-0.68; PD: aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.61-0.69; ALS: aOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.30-0.37), and lower odds of hospice enrollment (AD: aOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.31-0.36; PD: aOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.31-0.36; ALS: aOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.36-0.46).

    "abstract": "Digital self-management tools including mobile apps and wearables can enhance personalized care in Parkinson's disease, and incorporating patient and clinician feedback into their evaluation can empower users and nurture patient-clinician relationships, necessitating a review to assess the state of the art and refine their use.\nThis review aimed to summarize the state of the art of self-management systems used in Parkinson's disease management, detailing the application of self-management techniques and the integration of clinicians. It also aimed to provide a concise synthesis on the acceptance and usability of these systems from the clinicians' standpoint, reflecting both patient engagement and clinician experience.\nThe review was organized following the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews and PICOS frameworks. Studies were retrieved from PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore. Data was collected using a predefined form and then analyzed descriptively.\nOf the 15,231 studies retrieved, 33 were included. Five technology types were identified, with systems combining technologies being the most evaluated. Common self-management strategies included educational material and symptom journals. Only 11 studies gathered data from clinicians or reported evidence of clinician integration; out of those, six studies point out the importance of raw data availability, data visualization, and integrated data summaries.\nWhile self-management systems for Parkinson's disease are well-received by patients, the studies underscore the urgency for more research into their usability for clinicians and integration into daily medical workflows to enhance overall care quality.\nDigital tools, such as smartphone applications and wearable devices, could help people with Parkinson\u2019s disease manage their symptoms by using data and technology to provide support that is personalized to them and by supporting communication between patients and healthcare providers. This review studies current literature on these digital self-management systems for people with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Of the 33 studies included in our review, we found that many of these systems combine different types of digital technologies (for example, a mobile app and a wearable sensor). The most common strategies to help support patients with self-management included in these digital tools were providing educational health content and symptom diaries. Only a few studies have considered healthcare providers\u2019 perspectives on these systems. Those that did highlighted a need for better access to patient data, improved data presentation, and summaries of key health insights. While patients find digital self-management tools favorable, further research is needed to ensure they meet healthcare providers\u2019 professional needs and can fit easily into daily clinical routines, ultimately improving care for individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

    "abstract": "This work comprehends the development and characterization of a carbon black-based electrode modified with Au microflowers to increase its effect as a capacitance biosensor for the determination of PARK7/DJ-1. Due to its high surface-to-volume ratio and biocompatibility, Au particles are suitable for antibody binding, and by monitoring surface capacitance, it is possible to identify the immune-pair interaction. Au microflowers allowed the adequate immobilization of Parkinsonian-related proteins: PARK7/DJ-1 and its antibody. The protein is associated with several antioxidant mechanisms, but its abnormal concentrations or mutations can be the cause of the loss of dopaminergic neurons, leading to Parkinson's disease. The device was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry, revealing the flower-like structures and the electrochemically-interest enhancements they provide, such as increased heterogeneous electron transfer rate coefficient and electroactive area. The self-assembled monolayers of different molecules were optimized with the aid of 2",

Complementary and alternative medicine approaches have been utilized as adjuncts to conventional therapies for managing the symptoms and progression of PD. Natural\u00a0compounds have gained attention for their potential neuroprotective effects and ability to target various pathways involved in the pathogenesis of PD. This comprehensive review aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the molecular targets and mechanisms of natural compounds in various experimental models of PD. This review will also explore the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these compounds and assess the clinical studies investigating the impact of these natural compounds on individuals with PD. The insights shared in this review have the potential to pave the way for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies and interventions for PD.",

    "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in the maintenance of dopamine level and the survival of dopaminergic neurons, which may affect the functionality of brain structures responsible for motor and cognitive function. The aim of the study was to assess the association of individual and combined single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the rs6265 BDNF (Val66Met), rs397595 DAT (SLC6A3), and rs4680 COMT (Val158Met) genes with early\u2011onset of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Moreover, we assessed the association between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and the level of BDNF protein in the serum of patients with PD and controls. The study involved 163 patients with idiopathic PD divided into early onset (<55 years) and late\u2011onset (>55 years) groups and 91 healthy age\u2011matched people (Control). The SNP were determined using the TaqMan Real\u2011Time PCR method. Serum BDNF levels were determined by ELISA assay. The risk of developing early PD in people with the BDNF genotype AG increases threefold in comparison with the carriers of the BDNF genotype GG. In PD patients and healthy people with the BDNF genotypes AG and AA, a lower serum BDNF level was found compared to those with the BDNF genotype GG in both groups. The results of our study indicate that the presence of the Val66Met BDNF gene polymorphism is associated with reduced blood BDNF levels and an elevated risk of developing early\u2011onset PD. This effect appears to be more pronounced in men.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment (CI) is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). Multiple brain regions and their interactions are involved in PD associated CI. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology is a non-invasive method in investigating brain structure and inter-regional connections. In this study, by comparing cortical thickness, subcortical volume, and brain network topology properties in PD patients with and without CI, we aimed to understand the changes of brain structure and structural covariance network properties in PD associated CI.\nA total of 18 PD patients with CI and 33 PD patients without CI were recruited. Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr stage, Mini Mental State Examination Scale, Non-motor Symptom Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and Hamilton Depression Scale were assessed. All participants underwent structural 3T MRI. Cortical thickness, subcortical volume, global and nodal network topology properties were measured.\nCompared with PD patients without CI, the volumes of white matter, thalamus and hippocampus were lower in PD patients with CI. And decreased whole-brain local efficiency is associated with CI in PD patients. While the cortical thickness and nodal network topology properties were comparable between PD patients with and without CI.\nOur findings support the alterations of brain structure and disruption of structural covariance network are involved in PD associated CI, providing a new insight into the association between graph properties and PD associated CI.",

    "abstract": "Professor Klaus Fassbender is a distinguished neurologist from Germany, widely recognized for his groundbreaking contributions to the fields of neurology and neurodegenerative disease. His work has been pivotal in advancing our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as in refining therapeutic strategies for their treatment. His studies in cerebrovascular disease have elucidated the complex molecular and cellular processes involved in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, leading to the development of novel therapeutic interventions, often bridging the gap between laboratory discoveries and their application in clinical settings. Professor Klaus Fassbender is \"the father\" of the mobile stroke unit (MSU). With the \"time is brain\" concept in mind, he proposed and developed the MSU concept for the first time, allowing prehospital stroke imaging, diagnosis, and treatment directly at the site of emergency.\u00a0This concept reduced times between symptoms onset and treatment, resulting in an increased proportion of patients receiving treatment within \"the golden hour\" and leading to the improvement of functional outcomes at 90 days. Professor Fassbender's work has been instrumental in shaping contemporary approaches to diagnosing and managing stroke and neurodegenerative disease, making him a leading figure in modern neurology.",

    "abstract": "The search for neuroprotective treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) still relies largely on motor disability scales. A limitation of these tools is the strong influence of symptomatic dopaminergic treatment effects. Drawing on a wealth of published information, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of motor progression in PD and its relationships with dopaminergic therapy.\nWe searched Medline, Embase, and Central to identify 84 publications with adequate serial motor scores to calculate progression, expressed as an increase in the percentage of maximum disability.\nA random-effects model showed motor progression at 2.0% p.a. (95% CI 1.7-2.4%). There were no significant differences by baseline age, sample size, or observation period. However, untreated patients, in 8 publications, progressed at 4.5% p.a. compared to 1.6% p.a. in 76 studies containing individuals on dopaminergic drugs (\nThis survey suggests that accurate long-term measurements of motor progression to assess disease-modifying therapies can be conducted despite the sequential commencement of dopaminergic drugs and sample attrition over time. While study designs involving prodromal or untreated PD avoid confounding effects of symptomatic treatment, different assumptions about motor progression may be needed. A defined ",

    "abstract": "An essential aspect of motor learning is generalizing procedural knowledge to facilitate skill acquisition across diverse conditions. Here, we examined the development of generalized motor learning during initial practice-dependent learning, and how distinct components of learning are consolidated over longer timescales during wakefulness or sleep. In the first experiment, a group of young healthy volunteers engaged in a novel motor sequence task over 36\u2009h in a two-arm experimental design (either morning-evening-morning, or evening-morning-evening) aimed at controlling for circadian confounders. The findings unveiled an immediate, rapid generalization of sequential learning, accompanied by an additional long-timescale performance gain. Sleep modulated accuracy, but not speed, above and beyond equivalent wake intervals. To further elucidate the role of sleep across ages and under neurodegenerative disorders, a second experiment utilized the same task in a group of early-stage, drug-na\u00efve individuals with Parkinson's disease and in healthy individuals of comparable age. Participants with Parkinson's disease exhibited comparable performance to their healthy age-matched group with the exception of reduced performance in recalling motor sequences, revealing a disease-related cognitive shortfall. In line with the results found in young subjects, both groups exhibited improved accuracy, but not speed, following a night of sleep. This result emphasizes the role of sleep in skill acquisition and provides a potential framework for deeper investigation of the intricate relationship between sleep, aging, Parkinson's disease, and motor learning.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) is associated with a spectrum of nonmotor symptoms (NMS) that contribute as much to the burden of the disease as the more obvious motor abnormalities. There is a paucity of literature determining the association between NMS and the severity of IPD, especially in rural eastern parts of India.\nThis study explores the frequency of NMS in patients with IPD and determines the association between NMS and the severity of IPD.\nA cross-sectional observational study involving 65 serially enrolled IPD patients (diagnosed as per United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria) was conducted over a period of 18 months. The patients were evaluated for disease severity as per the Hoehn and Yahr scale (original) and were subsequently evaluated with a predesigned and validated Parkinson's Disease Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire. Pearson's Chi-squared test for independence of attributes or Fisher's exact test was used for comparison of categorical variables across the groups. Continuous variables were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test.\nThe most common presenting NMS of IPD was low mood (\nCommon presenting NMS include neuropsychiatric manifestations, autonomic symptoms, sleep-related symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations. Most of the NMS are significantly related to disease severity.",

    "abstract": "Propagation of neuronal \u03b1-synuclein aggregate pathology to the cortex and hippocampus correlates with cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) dementia and dementia with Lewy body disease. Previously, we showed accumulation of the parkin substrate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase interacting multifunctional protein-2 (AIMP2) in the temporal lobe of postmortem brains of patients with advanced PD. However, the potential pathological role of AIMP2 accumulation in the cognitive dysfunction of patients with PD remains unknown.\nWe performed immunofluorescence imaging to examine cellular distribution and accumulation of AIMP2 in brains of conditional AIMP2 transgenic mice and postmortem PD patients. The pathological role of AIMP2 was investigated in the AIMP2 transgenic mice by assessing Nissl-stained neuron counting in the hippocampal area and Barnes maze to determine cognitive functions. Potential secretion and cellular uptake of AIMP2 was monitored by dot blot analysis and immunofluorescence. The utility of AIMP2 as a new PD biomarker was evaluated by dot blot and ELISA measurement of plasma AIMP2 collected from PD patients and healthy control followed by ROC curve analysis.\nWe demonstrated that AIMP2 is toxic to the dentate gyrus neurons of the hippocampus and that conditional AIMP2 transgenic mice develop progressive cognitive impairment. Moreover, we found that neuronal AIMP2 expression levels correlated with the brain endothelial expression of AIMP2 in both AIMP2 transgenic mice and in the postmortem brains of patients with PD. AIMP2, when accumulated, was released from the neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y cells. Secreted AIMP2 was taken up by human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Consistent with the fact that AIMP2 can be released into the extracellular space, we showed that AIMP2 transgenic mice have higher levels of plasma AIMP2. Finally, ELISA-based assessment of AIMP2 in plasma samples from patients with PD and controls, and subsequent ROC curve analysis proved that high plasma AIMP2 expression could serve as a reliable molecular biomarker for PD diagnosis.\nThe pathological role in the hippocampus and the cell-to-cell transmissibility of AIMP2 provide new therapeutic avenues for PD treatment, and plasma AIMP2 combined with \u03b1-synuclein may improve the accuracy of PD diagnosis in the early stages.",

    "abstract": "We proposed a deep learning method using a convolutional neural network on time-series (TS) images to detect and differentiate affected body parts in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and freezing of gait (FOG) during 360\u00b0 turning tasks. The 360\u00b0 turning task was performed by 90 participants (60 people with PD [30 freezers and 30 nonfreezers] and 30 age-matched older adults (controls) at their preferred speed. The position and acceleration underwent preprocessing. The analysis was expanded from temporal to visual data using TS imaging methods. According to the PD vs. controls classification, the right lower third of the lateral shank (RTIB) on the least affected side (LAS) and the right calcaneus (RHEE) on the LAS were the most relevant body segments in the position and acceleration TS images. The RHEE marker exhibited the highest accuracy in the acceleration TS images. The identified markers for the classification of freezers vs. nonfreezers vs. controls were the left lateral humeral epicondyle (LELB) on the more affected side and the left posterior superior iliac spine (LPSI). The LPSI marker in the acceleration TS images displayed the highest accuracy. This approach could be a useful supplementary tool for determining PD severity and FOG.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a collection of small proteins with important roles in classical innate immunity, have been extensively studied in multiple organisms, particularly in Drosophila melanogaster. Advances in CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing have allowed individual AMP functions to be dissected, revealing specific and selective roles in host defense. Recent findings have also revealed many unexpected contributions of endogenous AMPs to neuronal functions and neurodegenerative diseases, and have shed light on the intersections between innate immunity and neurobiology. We explore the intricate relationships between AMPs and sleep regulation, memory formation, as well as traumatic brain injury and several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Understanding the diverse functions of AMPs opens new avenues for neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disease research and potential therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prominent motor disorder of adult-onset dementia connected to memory and other cognitive abilities. Individuals with this vicious neurodegenerative condition tend to have an elevated expression of Monoamine Oxidase-B (MAO-B) that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of aryalkylamines neurotransmitters with concomitant reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. This oxidative stress damages mitochondrial DNA and contributes to the progression of PD. To address this, we have developed a deep learning (DL)-based virtual screening protocol for the identification of promising MAO-B inhibitors using Convolutional neural network (ConvNet) based image classification technique by dealing with two unique kinds of image datasets associated with MACCS fingerprints. Following model building and prediction on the Maybridge library, our approach shortlisted the top 11 compounds at the end of molecular docking protocol. Further, the biological validation of the hits identified 4 compounds as promising MAO-B inhibitors. Among these, the compound RF02426 was found to have >50\u00a0% inhibition at 10\u00a0\u03bcM. Additionally, the study also underscored the utility of scaffold analysis as an effective way for evaluating the significance of structurally diverse compounds in data-driven investigations. We believe that our models are able to pick up diverse chemotype and this can be a starting scaffold for further structural optimization with medicinal chemistry efforts in order to improve their inhibition efficacy and be established as novel MAO-B inhibitors in the furture.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 19 (USP19) is a unique deubiquitinase (DUB), characterized by multiple variants generated by alternative splicing. Several variants bear a C-terminal transmembrane domain that anchors them to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Other than regulating protein stability by preventing proteasome degradation, USP19 has been reported to rescue substrates from ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) in a catalytic-independent manner, promote autophagy and address proteins to lysosomal degradation via endosomal microautophagy. USP19 has recently emerged as the protein responsible for the unconventional secretion of misfolded proteins including Parkinson's disease-associated protein \u03b1-synuclein. Despite mounting evidence that USP19 plays crucial roles in several biological processes, the underlying mechanisms are unclear due to lack of information on the physiological substrates of USP19. Herein, we used high-resolution quantitative proteomics to analyze changes in the secretome and cell proteome induced by loss of USP19 to identify proteins whose secretion or turnover is regulated by USP19. We found that ablation of USP19 induced significant proteomic alterations both in and out of the cell. Loss of USP19 impaired the release of several lysosomal proteins, including legumain (LGMN) and several cathepsins. In order to understand the underlaying mechanism, we dissected the USP19-regulated secretion of LGMN in several cell types. We found that LGMN was not a DUB substrate of USP19 and that its USP19-dependent release did not require their direct interaction. LGMN secretion occurred by a mechanism that involved the Golgi apparatus, autophagosome formation and lysosome function. This mechanism resembled the recently described \"lysosomal exocytosis\", by which lysosomal hydrolases are secreted, when ubiquitination of p62 is increased in cells lacking deubiquitinases such as USP15 and USP17. In conclusion, our proteomic characterization of USP19 has identified a collection of proteins in the secretome and within the cell that are regulated by USP19, which link USP19 to secretion of lysosomal proteins, including LGMN.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic networks determine brain function. Highly complex interconnected brain synaptic networks provide output even under fluctuating or pathological conditions. Relevant to the treatment of brain disorders, understanding the limitations of such functional networks becomes paramount. Here we use the example of Parkinson's Disease (PD) as a system disorder, with PD symptomatology emerging only when the functional reserves of neurons, and their interconnected networks, are unable to facilitate effective compensatory mechanisms. We have denoted this the \"threshold theory\" to account for how PD symptoms develop in sequence. In this perspective, threshold functions are delineated in a quantitative, synaptic, and cellular network context. This provides a framework to discuss the development of specific symptoms. PD includes dysfunction and degeneration in many organ systems and both peripheral and central nervous system involvement. The threshold theory accounts for and explains the reasons why parallel gradually emerging pathologies in brain and peripheral systems generate specific symptoms only when functional thresholds are crossed, like tipping points. New and mounting evidence demonstrate that PD and related neurodegenerative diseases are multisystem disorders, which transcends the traditional brain-centric paradigm. We believe that representation of threshold functions will be helpful to develop new medicines and interventions that are specific for both pre- and post-symptomatic periods of neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta region of the brain and accumulation of aggregated forms of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn), an intrinsically disordered protein, in the form of Lewy Bodies and Lewy Neurites. Substantial evidences point to the aggregated/fibrillar forms of \u03b1-Syn as a central event in PD pathogenesis, underscoring the modulation of \u03b1-Syn aggregation as a promising strategy for PD treatment. Consequently, numerous anti-aggregation agents, spanning from small molecules to polymers, have been scrutinized for their potential to mitigate \u03b1-Syn aggregation and its associated toxicity. Among these, small molecule modulators like osmoprotectants, polyphenols, cellular metabolites, metals, and peptides have emerged as promising candidates with significant potential in PD management. This article offers a comprehensive overview of the effects of these small molecule modulators on the aggregation propensity and associated toxicity of \u03b1-Syn and its PD-associated mutants. It serves as a valuable resource for identifying and developing potent, non-invasive, non-toxic, and highly specific small molecule-based therapeutic arsenal for combating PD. Additionally, it raises pertinent questions aimed at guiding future research endeavours in the field of \u03b1-Syn aggregation remodelling.",

    "abstract": "The nose-brain axis (NBA), a critical component of the body-brain axis, not only serves as a drug transport route for the treatment of brain diseases but also mediates changes such as neuroimmune disorders, which may be an important mechanism in the occurrence and development of some nasal or brain diseases. Despite its importance, there are substantial gaps that remain in our understanding of the characteristics of NBA-mediated diseases and of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the bidirectional NBA crosstalk. These gaps have limited the translational application of NBA-related research findings to some extent. Therefore, this review aims to address the conceptual framework of NBA and highlight its values in representative diseases by combining existing literature with new research results from our group. We hope that this paper will provide a basis for further in-depth research in this field, and facilitate the clinical translation of NBA.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have examined QT, JT interval, and ST-segment changes due to radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) in manifest Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in pediatric patients.\nThe study involved 27 patients (male-to-female, 13:14; age, 12 (5-16) years) who were diagnosed with WPW syndrome and underwent RFA in our hospital between 2009 and 2022. Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes were compared between the group with ventricular preexcitation due to an accessory pathway (manifest group, n\u00a0=\u00a016) and those without it (concealed group, n\u00a0=\u00a011).\nThe QT interval before RFA was significantly longer in the manifest group than in the concealed group (402 [362-482] vs. 344 [323-427]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The QT interval was significantly shortened in the manifest group before and after RFA (402 [362-482] vs. 360 [298-422] msec; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). At 1\u00a0month, the QT interval difference between the manifest and concealed groups disappeared (366 [305-437] vs. 335 [301-436] msec; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). ST-segment changes were found after RFA in 56\u00a0% (9/16) of the patients in the manifest group but not in the concealed group. ECG changes presenting the Brugada-pattern was found in one patient. One month later, ECG abnormalities persisted in only one patient.\nIn pediatric patients, the QT interval was prolonged in manifest WPW syndrome but shortened after RFA. In the manifest group, transient ST-segment change and T-wave abnormalities were often observed after RFA; however, the ECG normalized in approximately 1\u00a0month.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory-swallow coordination (RSC) frequently changes in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). Little is known about how these changes relate to impairments in swallowing safety (penetration and aspiration) and efficiency (pharyngeal residue). Therefore, the aims of this study were to assess the relationships between RSC, pharyngeal residue, penetration, and aspiration in PwPD.\nTwenty-four PwPD were recruited to undergo simultaneous assessment of RSC, swallowing safety, and swallowing efficiency. RSC was assessed using respiratory inductive plethysmography and nasal airflow and included measurements of respiratory pause duration, respiratory phase patterning, and lung volume during swallowing. Swallowing safety and efficiency were assessed using flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, analyzed using the Visual Analysis of Swallowing Efficiency and Safety, and included measurements of pharyngeal residue, penetration, and aspiration. All data were blindly analyzed, with 20% of the data repeated for interrater reliability assessment. Multilevel statistical models were used to examine the relationships between RSC and swallowing.\nA total of 812 swallows were analyzed from 24 participants. Only 33.4% of swallows exhibited the typical exhale-swallow-exhale pattern. Additionally, 95% of participants exhibited abnormal swallow function. More severe hypopharyngeal residue ratings were associated with inhaling before the swallow compared to exhaling before the swallow. Additionally, more severe events of penetration and aspiration were associated with (a) inhaling before the swallow compared to exhaling before the swallow, (b) inhaling after the swallow compared to exhaling after the swallow, and (c) longer swallow-related respiratory pause durations. Inhaling after the swallow exhibited the strongest relationship with impairments in swallowing safety when compared to all other RSC variables.\nRSC exhibited significant relationships with pharyngeal residue, penetration, and aspiration in these PwPD. Clinicians should attend to RSC when assessing swallowing in PwPD. Future research is needed to examine if training an exhale-swallow-exhale pattern can be used to improve disordered swallowing in PwPD.\nhttps://doi.org/10.23641/asha.27211770.",

RSC was assessed using respiratory inductive plethysmography and nasal airflow and included measurements of respiratory pause duration, respiratory phase patterning, and lung volume during swallowing. Swallowing safety and efficiency were assessed using flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, analyzed using the Visual Analysis of Swallowing Efficiency and Safety, and included measurements of pharyngeal residue, penetration, and aspiration. All data were blindly analyzed, with 20% of the data repeated for interrater reliability assessment. Multilevel statistical models were used to examine the relationships between RSC and swallowing.",

Additionally, 95% of participants exhibited abnormal swallow function. More severe hypopharyngeal residue ratings were associated with inhaling before the swallow compared to exhaling before the swallow. Additionally, more severe events of penetration and aspiration were associated with (a) inhaling before the swallow compared to exhaling before the swallow, (b) inhaling after the swallow compared to exhaling after the swallow, and (c) longer swallow-related respiratory pause durations. Inhaling after the swallow exhibited the strongest relationship with impairments in swallowing safety when compared to all other RSC variables.",

    "abstract": "Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) is implicated in both a rare, monogenic disorder (Gaucher disease, GD) and a common, multifactorial condition (Parkinson's disease, PD); hence, it is an urgent therapeutic target. To identify correctors of severe protein misfolding and trafficking obstruction manifested by the pathogenic L444P-variant of GCase, we developed a suite of quantitative, high-throughput, cell-based assays. First, we labeled GCase with a small proluminescent HiBiT peptide reporter tag, enabling quantitation of protein stabilization in cells while faithfully maintaining target biology. TALEN-based gene editing allowed for stable integration of a single HiBiT-",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing demand for the provision of speech language pathology (SLP) services via telehealth. Therefore, we systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials comparing telehealth to face-to-face provision of SLP services.\nWe searched Medline, Embase and Cochrane, clinical trial registries, and conducted a citation analysis to identify trials. We included randomized trials comparing similar care delivered live via telehealth (phone or video), to face-to-face. Primary outcomes included: % syllables stuttered (%SS) (for individuals who stutter); change in sound pressure levels monologue (for individuals with Parkinson's disease); and key function scores (for other areas). Where data were sufficient, mean differences were calculated.\nNine randomized controlled trials were included; eight evaluated video and one evaluated phone telehealth. Risk of bias was generally low or unclear, excepting blinding. There were no significant differences at any time-point up to 18 months for %SS (mean difference, MD 0.1, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.6, \nEvidence suggests that the telehealth provision of SLP services may be a viable alternative to their provision face-to-face, particularly to people who stutter and people with Parkinson's disease. The key limitation is the small number of randomized controlled trials, as well as evidence on the quality of life, well-being and satisfaction and economic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria play a crucial role in brain aging due to their involvement in bioenergetics, neuroinflammation and brain steroid synthesis. Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We investigated changes in the activities of the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes in normally aging baboon brains and determined how these changes relate to donor sex, morning cortisol levels, and walking speed. Using a novel approach, we assessed mitochondrial bioenergetics from frozen prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissues from a large cohort (60 individuals) of well-characterized aging baboons (6.6-22.8 years, approximately equivalent to 26.4-91.2 human years). Aging was associated with a decline in mitochondrial ETC complexes in the PFC, which was more pronounced when activities were normalized for citrate synthase activity, suggesting that the decline in respiration is predominantly driven by changes in the specific activity of individual complexes rather than changes in mitochondrial number. Moreover, when donor sex was used as a covariate, we found that mitochondrial respiration was preserved with age in females, whereas males showed significant loss of ETC activity with age. Males had higher activities of each individual ETC complex and greater lactate dehydrogenase activity relative to females. Circulating cortisol levels correlated only with complex II-linked respiration in males. We also observed a robust positive predictive relationship between walking speed and respiration linked to complexes I, III, and IV in males but not in females. This data reveals a previously unknown link between aging and bioenergetics across multiple tissues linking frailty and bioenergetic function. This study highlights a potential molecular mechanism for sexual dimorphism in brain resilience and suggests that in males changes in PFC bioenergetics contribute to reduced motor function with age.",

    "abstract": "Plasma membrane protein degradation and recycling is regulated by the endolysosomal system, wherein endosomes bud from the plasma membrane into the cytosol and mature into degradative lysosomes. As such, the endolysosomal system plays a critical role in determining the abundance of proteins on the cell surface, influencing cellular identity and function. Highly polarized cells, like neurons, rely on the endolysosomal system for axonal and dendritic specialization and synaptic compartmentalization. The importance of this system to neuronal function is reflected by the prevalence of risk variants in components of the system in several neurodegenerative diseases, ranging from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, our understanding of endocytic cargo and core endolysosomal machinery in neurons is limited, in part due to technical limitations. Here, we developed a toolkit for capturing EEA1-postive endosomes (Endo-IP) and TMEM192-positive lysosomes (Lyso-IP) in stem cell-derived induced neurons (iNeurons). We demonstrated its utility by revealing the endolysosomal protein landscapes for cortical-like iNeurons and stem cells. This allowed us to globally profile endocytic cargo, identifying hundreds of transmembrane proteins, including neurogenesis and synaptic proteins, as well as endocytic cargo with predicted SNX17 or SNX27 recognition motifs. By contrast, parallel lysosome profiling reveals a simpler protein repertoire, reflecting in part temporally controlled recycling or degradation for many endocytic targets. This system will facilitate mechanistic interrogation of endolysosomal components found as risk factors in neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction stands as one of the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in the initial stage of Parkinson's disease (PD). Nevertheless, the intricate mechanisms underlying olfactory deficits in Parkinson's disease still remain elusive.\nThis study collected rs-fMRI data from 30 PD patients [15 with severe hyposmia (PD-SH) and 15 with no/mild hyposmia (PD-N/MH)] and 15 healthy controls (HC). To investigate functional segregation, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) were utilized. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis was performed to explore the functional integration across diverse brain regions. Additionally, the graph theory-based network analysis was employed to assess functional networks in PD patients. Furthermore, Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to delve deeper into the relationship between the severity of olfactory dysfunction and various functional metrics.\nWe discovered pronounced variations in ALFF, ReHo, FC, and topological brain network attributes across the three groups, with several of these disparities exhibiting a correlation with olfactory scores.\nUsing fMRI, our study analyzed brain function in PD-SH, PD-N/MH, and HC groups, revealing impaired segregation and integration in PD-SH and PD-N/MH. We hypothesize that changes in temporal, frontal, occipital, and cerebellar activities, along with aberrant cerebellum-insula connectivity and node degree and betweenness disparities, may be linked to olfactory dysfunction in PD patients.",

We hypothesize that changes in temporal, frontal, occipital, and cerebellar activities, along with aberrant cerebellum-insula connectivity and node degree and betweenness disparities, may be linked to olfactory dysfunction in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Recent research has emphasized a significant correlation between microRNAs (miRNAs) and PD. To identify key research areas, provide a comprehensive overview of current research in various fields, and propose potential directions for future studies, a bibliometric analysis was conducted on the involvement of miRNAs in Parkinson's disease from 2014 to 2023.\nRelevant literature records were collected from the Web of Science Core Collection on February 29, 2024. Subsequently, the data underwent analysis using the Bibliometrix R package and VOSviewer (version 1.6.19).\nThe annual scientific publications on miRNAs and Parkinson's disease demonstrated an increasing trend, with an annual growth rate of 12.67%. China, the United States, and India emerged as the top three most productive countries/regions. The University of Barcelona had the highest annual publications, followed by Central South University and the Helmholtz Association. The \nThis study focused on identifying emerging trends and critical research topics in the bibliometric analysis of microRNAs related to Parkinson's disease. These findings highlight the diverse research landscape and evolving trend of miRNA-related research in PD. The field of miRNA research in Parkinson's disease is actively exploring the underlying mechanisms of miRNA function, identifying potential diagnostic markers, and developing innovative therapeutic strategies. The results of our study offer significant contributions to researchers' ability to track contemporary developments and guide the trajectory of future research in this domain.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Clinically, the therapeutic strategy of PD could only alleviate the symptoms. Nursing plays a crucial role in providing patient education, symptom management, and psychosocial support. This study aims to analyze the current state and prospects of research in the field of Parkinson's disease (PD) and its associated nursing care through bibliometric methods to explore the trends that May guide its future development.\nLiterature related to Parkinson's disease and nursing care was systematically searched by the Web of Science database from 1991 to 2023. Quantitative analysis of cooperative networks was conducted using bibliometric tools VOSviewer and CiteSpace.\nThe analysis covered 2,649 publications in the field of PD and nursing care, authored by 12,576 researchers from 3,869 institutions across 94 countries. The number of articles has steadily increased over the past 20\u2009years. In this research field, the United States and the United Kingdom emerged as leading countries, and Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen was positioned as an international hub. \nResearch in Parkinson's disease and nursing care is experiencing a period of rapid growth, with continuous expansion in research scope and depth of investigation. One of the trends identified is the increasing focus on quality of life and the management of dementia in PD patients, reflecting the importance of these areas in research. The study further suggests that future advancements in the field May rely significantly on strengthening international collaborations and addressing global disparities in resource distribution, particularly by promoting research inclusivity and cooperation among low-resource countries.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), demonstrate sex differences with regard to prevalence, age of onset, and motor manifestations. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common early and late manifestations of these disorders.\nWe aimed to describe sex differences in NPS across alpha-synucleinopathies.\nWe searched Web of Science Core collection databases to identify observational studies published between January 1, 2000, and June 1, 2022, reporting the prevalence or severity of NPS among individuals with a diagnosis of PD, PDD, or DLB. Prevalence and severity were pooled for each NPS according to sex using random-effects models.\nTwo-hundred-and-forty studies, representing 796,026 participants (45% females), were included in the meta-analysis. Female sex was associated with a higher prevalence of anxiety (OR\u2009=\u20091.60 [95% CI: 1.40, 1.82]), depression (OR\u2009=\u20091.56 [1.45, 1.67]), fatigue (OR\u2009=\u20091.21 [1.02, 1.43]), and psychotic symptoms (OR\u2009=\u20091.26 [1.14, 1.40]) and more severe anxiety (g\u2009=\u20091.35 [95% CI: 0.58, 2.13]), depression (g\u2009=\u20091.57 [1.05, 2.08]), and fatigue (g\u2009=\u20090.86 [0.41, 1.32]), while male sex was associated with a higher prevalence of apathy (OR\u2009=\u20090.77 [0.63, 0.93]), impulse control disorders (OR\u2009=\u20090.67 [0.55, 0.82]), REM sleep behavior disorder (OR\u2009=\u20090.54 [0.42, 0.70]), hypersomnolence (OR\u2009=\u20090.67 [0.56, 0.80]), and suicide (OR\u2009=\u20090.30 [0.20, 0.44]).\nNPS have different prevalences and severities in alpha-synucleinopathies according to sex.

    "abstract": "There is a substantial body of observational research indicating an association between hearing impairment and dementia, yet the causal relationship and underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. This study aims to investigate the causal relationship between hearing impairment and its subtypes with dementia and cognitive function using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.\nWe performed two-sample MR analysis to examine the causal effects of hearing impairment and its subtypes, including conductive and sensorineural hearing loss (CSHL), conductive hearing loss (CHL), sensorineural hearing loss (SHL), and sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SIHL), on six dementia phenotypes (overall dementia, Alzheimer's disease [AD], Lewy body dementia [DLB], frontotemporal dementia [FTD], Parkinson's disease dementia, and vascular dementia) and four cognitive functions. Additionally, multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was employed to investigate potential mediating mechanisms.\nGenetically determined CSHL was associated with an elevated risk of DLB (odds ratio [OR] 1.69; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.63; P\u2009=\u20090.021) and FTD (OR 1.66; 1.04 to 2.67; P\u2009=\u20090.035), but not AD (P\u2009=\u20090.958). Genetic predisposition to CHL was found to link with increased risks of AD (OR 1.07; 1.01 to 1.14; P\u2009=\u20090.031). Genetically determined SHL was causally associated with an elevated risk of semantic dementia (OR 3.81; 1.09 to 13.37; P\u2009=\u20090.037). Genetically predicted CHL and SIHL were both causally associated with lower general cognitive performance (\u03b2 -0.015 and -\u20090.043; P\u2009=\u20090.007 and 0.013) and fluid intelligence score (\u03b2 -0.045 and -\u20090.095; P\u2009=\u20090.037 and 0.040). In MVMR analysis, the causal relationship between hearing impairment and dementia was mediated by loneliness, depressed mood, and brain cortical volume, particularly the medial temporal lobe, but not by aging or ischemic stroke.\nOverall, the study provides evidence supporting a causal relationship between hearing impairment and increased risks of different types of dementia (including AD, FTD, and DLB), as well as poorer general cognitive function. These findings underscore the importance of addressing hearing impairment as a modifiable risk factor for dementia.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by clinical motor signs and non-motor symptoms that severely impact quality of life. There is an urgent need for therapies that might slow, halt or even reverse the progression of existing symptoms or delay the onset of new symptoms. Photobiomodulation is a therapy that has shown potential to alleviate some symptoms of Parkinson's disease in animal studies and in small clinical trials.\nTo assess long-term effectiveness of photobiomodulation therapy in a cohort of Parkinson's disease individuals after five years of continuing therapy.\nEight participants of the initial 12 in a previously published study agreed to be reassessed after five years. Seven of these participants had continued home-based, self-applied photobiomodulation therapy three times per week for five years. One participant had discontinued treatment after one year. Participants were assessed for a range of clinical motor signs, including MDS-UPDRS-III, measures of mobility and balance. Cognition was assessed objectively, and quality of life and sleep quality were assessed using self-reported questionnaires. A Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was used to evaluate change in outcome measures between baseline (before treatment) and after five years, with the alpha value set to 0.05.\nOf the seven participants who had continued photobiomodulation therapy, one had a preliminary diagnosis of multisystem atrophy and was excluded from the group analysis. For the remaining six participants, there was a significant improvement in walk speed, stride length, timed up-and-go tests, tests of dynamic balance, and cognition compared to baseline and nonsignificant improvements in all other measures, apart from MDS-UPDRS-III, which was unchanged and one measure of static balance (single leg stance, standing on the unaffected leg with eyes open) which declined. Five of six participants either improved or showed no decline in MDS-UPDRS-III score and most participants showed improvement or no decline in all other outcome measures. No adverse effects of the photobiomodulation therapy were reported.\nThis study provides a signal that photobiomodulation therapy might safely reduce important clinical motor signs and non-motor symptoms in some Parkinson's disease patients, with improvements maintained over several years. Home-based photobiomodulation therapy has the potential to complement standard therapies to manage symptoms and potentially delay Parkinson's symptom progression.\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, registration number ACTRN12618000038291p, registered on 12/01/2018.",

    "results": "Of the seven participants who had continued photobiomodulation therapy, one had a preliminary diagnosis of multisystem atrophy and was excluded from the group analysis. For the remaining six participants, there was a significant improvement in walk speed, stride length, timed up-and-go tests, tests of dynamic balance, and cognition compared to baseline and nonsignificant improvements in all other measures, apart from MDS-UPDRS-III, which was unchanged and one measure of static balance (single leg stance, standing on the unaffected leg with eyes open) which declined. Five of six participants either improved or showed no decline in MDS-UPDRS-III score and most participants showed improvement or no decline in all other outcome measures. No adverse effects of the photobiomodulation therapy were reported.",

    "abstract": "The attainable resolution of fluorescence microscopy has reached the subnanometer range, but this technique still fails to image the morphology of single proteins or small molecular complexes. Here, we expand the specimens at least tenfold, label them with conventional fluorophores and image them with conventional light microscopes, acquiring videos in which we analyze fluorescence fluctuations. One-step nanoscale expansion (ONE) microscopy enables the visualization of the shapes of individual membrane and soluble proteins, achieving around 1-nm resolution. We show that conformational changes are readily observable, such as those undergone by the ~17-kDa protein calmodulin upon Ca",

    "abstract": "L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is currently the preferred treatment for Parkinson's Disease (PD) and is considered the gold standard. However, prolonged use of L-DOPA in patients can result in involuntary movements known as Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), which includes uncontrollable dystonia affecting the trunk, limbs, and face. The role of \u0394FosB protein, a truncated splice variant of the FosB gene, in LID has been acknowledged, but its underlying mechanism has remained elusive. Here, using a mouse model of Parkinson's disease treated with chronic levodopa we demonstrate that serum response factor (SRF) binds to the FosB promoter, thereby activating FosB expression and levodopa induced-dyskinetic movements. Western blot analysis demonstrates a significant increase in SRF expression in the dyskinetic group compared to the control group. Knocking down SRF significantly reduced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMS) and \u0394FosB expression compared to the control. Conversely, overexpression of SRF led to an increase in \u0394FosB expression and worsened levodopa-induced dyskinesia. To shed light on the regulatory role of the Akt signaling pathway in this phenomenon, we administered the Akt agonist SC79 to PD mouse models via intraperitoneal injection, followed by L-DOPA administration. The expression of SRF, \u0394FosB, and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) significantly increased in this group compared to the group receiving normal saline to signify that these happen through Akt signaling pathway. Collectively, our findings identify a promising therapeutic target for addressing levodopa-induced dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates. \u03b1-synuclein forms droplets via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), followed by liquid-solid phase separation (LSPS) to form amyloids, how this process is physiologically-regulated remains unclear. \u03b2-synuclein colocalizes with \u03b1-synuclein in presynaptic terminals. Here, we report that \u03b2-synuclein partitions into \u03b1-synuclein condensates promotes the LLPS, and slows down LSPS of \u03b1-synuclein, while disease-associated \u03b2-synuclein mutations lose these capacities. Exogenous \u03b2-synuclein improves the movement defects and prolongs the lifespan of an \u03b1-synuclein-expressing NL5901 Caenorhabditis elegans strain, while disease-associated \u03b2-synuclein mutants aggravate the symptoms. Decapeptides targeted at the \u03b1-/\u03b2-synuclein interaction sites are rationally designed, which suppress the LSPS of \u03b1-synuclein, rescue the movement defects, and prolong the lifespan of C. elegans NL5901. Together, we unveil a Yin-Yang balance between \u03b1- and \u03b2-synuclein underlying the normal and disease states of PD and DLB with therapeutical potentials.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease manifests as neurological alterations within dendritic spines in the striatal and neocortical brain regions, where their functionality closely correlates with morphology. However, the impact of current pharmacotherapy on dendritic spine neuroplasticity, crucial for novel drug development in neurological and psychiatric disorders, remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of 6-OHDA intrastriatal bilateral lesions in male adult rats on behavior and dendritic spine neuroplasticity in striatal and cortical neurons. Furthermore, it evaluated the influence of chronic co-administration of pramipexole (PPX), a D3 receptor agonist, and rasagiline (Ras), a selective MAO-B inhibitor, on these alterations. Lesioned animals exhibited impaired balance behavior, with no improvement following PPX-Ras treatment. The 6-OHDA lesion decreased dendritic spine density in caudate putamen (CPU) spiny projection neurons (SPNs), a change unaffected by treatment, though PPX-Ras increased mushroom spines and reduced stubby spines in these neurons. In nucleus accumbens (NAcc) SPNs and prefrontal cortex layer 3 (PFC-3) pyramidal cells, dendritic spine density remained unaltered, but PPX-Ras decreased mushroom spines and increased bifurcated spines in the NAcc, while increasing mushroom spines and decreasing stubby spines in PFC-3 in lesioned rats. These findings emphasize the importance of dendritic spines as promising targets for innovative pharmacotherapies for Parkinson's disease.",

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the developing human ventral midbrain has identified four cell types expressing markers used to define correctly patterned mDA progenitors. Here, we use CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a fluorescent human embryonic stem cell line for the isolation of two potential mDA progenitors, Rgl1 and ProgM. We expect that by isolating specific mDA progenitor cell type/s and defining their function, it may be possible to develop more precise cell replacement strategies for PD.",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-syn), a crucial molecule in Parkinson's disease (PD), is known for its interaction with lipid membranes, which facilitates vesicle trafficking and modulates its pathological aggregation. Deciphering the complexity of the membrane-binding behavior of \u03b1-syn is crucial to understand its functions and the pathology of PD. Here, we used single-molecule imaging to show that \u03b1-syn forms multimers on lipid membranes with huge intermultimer distances. The multimers are characterized by self-limiting growth, manifesting in concentration-dependent exchanges of monomers, which are fast at micromolar concentrations and almost stop at nanomolar concentrations. We further uncovered movement patterns of \u03b1-syn's occasional trapping on membranes, which may be attributed to sparse lipid packing defects. Mutations such as E46K and E35K may disrupt the limit on the growth, resulting in larger multimers and accelerated amyloid fibril formation. This work emphasizes sophisticated regulation of \u03b1-syn multimerization on membranes as a critical underlying factor in the PD pathology.",

    "abstract": "The exploration of novel natural products for Parkinson's disease (PD) is a focus of current research, as there are no definitive drugs to cure or stop the disease. Campsis grandiflora (Thunb.) K. Schum (Lingxiaohua) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and the exact active constituents and putative mechanisms for treating PD are unknown. Through data mining and network pharmacology, apigenin (APi) was identified as the main active ingredient of Lingxiaohua, and key targets (TNF, AKT1, INS, TP53, CASP3, JUN, BCL2, MMP9, FOS, and HIF1A) of Lingxiaohua for the treatment of PD were discovered. The primary routes implicated were identified as PI3K/AKT, Apoptosis, TNF, and NF-\u03baB pathways. Subsequently, therapeutic potential of APi in PD and its underlying mechanism were experimentally evaluated. APi suppressed the release of mediators of inflammation and initiation of NF-\u03baB pathways in MES23.5 cells induced by MPP+. APi suppressed caspase-3 activity and apoptosis and elevated p-AKT levels in MES23.5 cells. Pretreatment with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, resulted in APi treatment blocking the activation of NF-\u03baB pathway and expression of inflammatory factors in MES23.5 cells by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. In conclusion, APi protects dopaminergic neurons by controlling the PI3K/AKT/NF-\u03baB pathway, giving novel insights into the pharmacological mechanism of Lingxiaohua in treating PD.",

    "abstract": "Motor symptoms such as tremor and bradykinesia can develop concurrently in Parkinson's disease; thus, the ideal home monitoring system should be capable of tracking symptoms continuously despite background noise from daily activities. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting symptom episodes in a free-living scenario, providing a higher level of interpretability to aid AI-powered decision-making. Machine learning models trained on wearable sensor data from scripted activities performed by participants in the lab and clinician ratings of the video recordings of these tasks identified tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia in the supervised lab environment with a balanced accuracy of 83%, 75%, and 81%, respectively, when compared to the clinician ratings. The performance of the same models when evaluated on data from subjects performing unscripted activities unsupervised in their own homes achieved a balanced accuracy of 63%, 63%, and 67%, respectively, in comparison to self-assessment patient diaries, further highlighting their limitations. The ankle-worn sensor was found to be advantageous for the detection of dyskinesias but did not show an added benefit for tremor and bradykinesia detection here.",

    "abstract": "Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase associated with the regulation of synaptic plasticity and centriole duplication. We identify PLK2 as a crucial early-response gene in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cells. Knockdown or inhibition of PLK2 remarkably attenuates LPS-induced expression of proinflammatory factors in microglial cells by suppressing the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta (IKK\u03b2)-nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB signaling pathway. We identify heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90\u03b1), a regulator of IKK\u03b2 activity, as a novel PLK2 substrate. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of HSP90\u03b1 abolishes PLK2-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity and microglial inflammatory activation. Furthermore, phosphoproteomic analysis pinpoints Ser252 and Ser263 on HSP90\u03b1 as novel phosphorylation targets of PLK2. Lastly, conditional knockout of PLK2 in microglial cells dramatically ameliorates neuroinflammation and subsequent dopaminergic neuron loss in an intracranial LPS-induced mouse Parkinson's disease (PD) model. The present study reveals that PLK2 promotes microglial activation through the phosphorylation of HSP90\u03b1 and subsequent activation of the IKK\u03b2-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Oligomeric forms of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) are critical in the formation of \u03b1-synuclein fibrils, exhibiting neurotoxic properties that are pivotal in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). A salient feature of this pathology is the disruption of the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to a perturbation in the ER's protein quality control mechanisms. The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins instigates ER stress. However, the onset of ER stress and the consequent activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Degradation (ERAD) pathways do not merely culminate in apoptosis when they fail to restore cellular homeostasis. More critically, this condition initiates a cascade of reactions involving ER-related structures and organelles, resulting in multifaceted cellular damage and, potentially, a feedback loop that precipitates neuroinflammation. In this review, we elucidate the interplay between UPR and ERAD, as well as the intricate crosstalk among the ER and other organelles such as mitochondria, lysosomes, and the Golgi apparatus, underscoring their roles in the neurodegenerative process.",

    "abstract": "Psychosis and cognitive decline often co-occur in Parkinson's Disease (PD), which complicates assessment.\nWe measured agreement between patients with PD and dementia (PDD) and care partners (CPs) in their independent evaluation of PD-related psychotic symptoms.\nWe compared responses to a PD psychosis rating scale (SAPS-PD) in 21 dyads of patients with PDD and cognitively normal CPs. We assessed the concordance of responses using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Following the psychosis assessment, the clinician used all available information and adjudicated who provided the most reliable responses.\nDyads demonstrated poor concordance in summary scores (ICC\u2009=\u20090.464). Six of the nine individual items had poor agreement. The clinician adjudicated the patient's response as the more reliable in 71.4% of cases.\nAlthough many psychotic symptoms are internal and not observable, in the context of PDD, both patient and CP inputs are valuable, but final adjudication favors patient responses.",

    "abstract": "Developmental stuttering, a multifactorial speech disorder with remarkable rate of spontaneous recovery pose challenges for gene discoveries. Exonic variants in GNPTAB, GNPTG, and NAGPA involved in lysosomal pathway and AP4E1, IFNAR1, and ARMC3-signaling genes reported till date explain only \u223c2.1% - 3.7% of persistent stuttering cases.\nWe aimed to identify additional genetic determinants of stuttering in a multiplex family by exome sequencing (n\u00a0=\u00a027) and further validation on additional extended family members (n\u00a0=\u00a021).\nWe employed hypothesis-free and pathway-based analyses.\nA novel heterozygous exonic variant NM_016256.4:c.322G\u00a0>\u00a0A in NAGPA with reduced penetrance and predicted pathogenicity segregated with the phenotype in a large subset of the family. Reanalysis to identify additional disease-causing variant(s) revealed exonic heterozygous variants each in RIMS2 and XYLT1 in severely affected members; and IGF2R variant in a small subset of the family. Furthermore, pathway-based analysis uncovered NM_022089.4:c.3529G\u00a0>\u00a0A in ATP13A2 (PARK9) in affected members; and variants in GNPTAB and GNPTG of minor significance in a few affected members.\nGenotype-phenotype correlation efforts suggest that the combined effect of gene variants at multiple loci or variants in a single gene in different subsets of the pedigree (genetic heterogeneity) may be contributing to stuttering in this family. More importantly, variants identified in ATP13A2, a Parkinson's disease gene also implicated in lysosomal dysfunction, and RIMS2 suggests for the first time a likely role of dopamine signaling in stuttering.\nScreening for these variants in independent stuttering cohorts would be astute.",

    "abstract": "Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to motor and non-motor symptoms. Atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS), including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and essential tremor (ET), present with overlapping clinical features, making differential diagnosis challenging. Conventional MRI has limitations in distinguishing PD from APS, necessitating advanced imaging techniques like diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for more accurate diagnosis. Objectives This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of DTI\u00a0in diagnosing PD\u00a0and APS, particularly assessing its ability to differentiate these conditions from each other compared to conventional MRI. Additionally, the study sought to determine if DTI could diagnose PD in cases where conventional MRI results were normal, thereby highlighting the potential role of DTI in enhancing diagnostic precision in neurodegenerative disorders. Methodology The study included 30 patients with clinically diagnosed PD or APS who underwent both conventional MRI and DTI. Data were collected retrospectively. Imaging was performed using a Philips Multiva 1.5-Tesla MRI scanner (Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands). DTI sequences were analyzed for fractional anisotropy (FA)\u00a0values in the substantia nigra, superior cerebellar peduncle, middle cerebellar peduncle, transverse pontine fibers, and dentate nucleus. The FA values were compared with established normal values, and the findings from DTI were correlated with clinical diagnoses and conventional MRI results. Results Among the 30 patients, 53.3% were clinically diagnosed with PD\u00a0and 46.7% with APS, including PSP and ET. Conventional MRI findings were normal in 46.7% of cases, indicating its limitations in detecting early or subtle changes in neurodegenerative disorders. In contrast, DTI identified abnormalities in 83.3% of cases, demonstrating its superior diagnostic sensitivity. DTI detected significant FA value reductions in the substantia nigra in PD patients (mean FA: 0.440), which is consistent with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons characteristic of PD. In PSP patients, the superior cerebellar peduncle showed marked FA reductions (mean FA: 0.523), correlating with the clinical features of PSP, such as bradykinesia and postural instability. ET was identified by reduced FA values in the superior cerebellar peduncle and dentate nucleus, distinguishing it from other forms of parkinsonism. DTI was particularly effective in cases where conventional MRI results were inconclusive or normal, identifying early-stage PD and differentiating it from APS with greater accuracy. The study demonstrated a sensitivity of 95.8% and specificity of 93.8% for DTI in differentiating PD from APS compared to conventional MRI. Conclusion This study highlights DTI as a superior imaging modality for the early diagnosis and differentiation of parkinsonian disorders, particularly when conventional MRI results are inconclusive. DTI's ability to detect significant microstructural changes in specific brain regions, evidenced by FA value reductions, enhances diagnostic accuracy. Incorporating DTI into routine clinical practice is essential for accurate differentiation between PD and APS, facilitating better patient management.",

    "abstract": "The hip fracture causes significant disabilities in many elderly people. Many studies around the world have identified various risk factors for the hip fracture. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the risk factors of hip fractures. This study is a systematic review of risk factors for hip fractures. All published papers in English and Persian languages on patients in Iran and other countries between 2002 - 2022 were examined. The search strategy used keywords matching the mesh, including : predictors, hip fracture, and disability. Articles were selected from international databases (PubMed, Proquest ,Web of Sience, Scopus, Google scholar and Persian(Sid,Magiran), and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias. The study has identified several factors that were significantly correlated with the risk of hip fracture, including age, cigarette and alcohol consumption, visual and hearing problems, low BMI levels, history of falling, weakness, and diseases such as stroke, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, arthritis, diabetes, dementia, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, liver and kidney diseases, bone density, osteoporosis, vertebral fracture, and hyperthyroidism. However, the study did not find any significant correlations between the consumption of calcium and vitamin D, history of fractures, cognitive disorders, schizophrenia, and household income, and the risk of hip fracture. The results of this study reveal the determining role of some risk factors in hip fracture in older persons. Therefore, it is recommended that health policy makers provide the possibility of early intervention for some changeable factors.",

    "abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a heterogenous condition, presenting with core clinical features of autonomic dysfunction, parkinsonism, and/or cerebellar ataxia. The presence of alpha-synuclein glial cytoplasmic inclusion is the hallmark of MSA. It shares a common pathological origin with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (DLB) and they are collectively grouped as \"synucleinopathies.\" The pathological synuclein protein is now well- recognized in skin biopsies of these patients. Besides the pathological findings, radiological investigation is a useful diagnostic tool. Brain MRI helps rule out other etiologies, and findings like the \"Hot-cross bun\" sign, \"putaminal atrophy,\" and \"infratentorial findings\" can assist with the diagnosis of MSA. Cardiac MIBG scan, autonomic testing, urodynamic studies can help differentiate MSA from other conditions. Although diagnostic tools are available for MSA diagnosis, clarity is needed on when to use these tests. We suggest a diagnostic algorithm to navigate the use of these tests. However, this algorithm is not intended to replace the use of current MDS diagnostic criteria of MSA.",

    "abstract": "Administering radiation therapy to individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) and psychiatric patients taking antipsychotics poses challenges, especially with whole breast irradiation (WBI) due to difficulty staying still (DSS). In such scenarios, intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT-IORT) provides an alternative. Although prior studies have shown its applicability in special cases where WBI may be contraindicated, there is a paucity of literature emphasizing its role in patients with ID and psychiatric conditions who have DSS. Therefore, our case series aims to highlight the applicability of administering TARGIT-IORT in such patients.\nFour breast cancer patients underwent lumpectomy and TARGIT-IORT. Among them, two patients had ID, with one experiencing a decreased range of motion. The other two had psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, both manifesting involuntary movements and DSS. Three patients had invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and one had invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). All patients undergoing TARGIT-IORT tolerated the procedure well. Notably, none of the patients exhibited evidence of disease on follow-up.\nOur study underscores the potential use of TARGIT-IORT as a viable treatment option for breast cancer patients with intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. Unlike traditional EBRT, TARGIT-IORT offers a single radiation dose, addressing challenges associated with compliance or DSS. Our findings demonstrate positive outcomes and tolerance, especially in patients where standard oncologic procedures are difficult to achieve. TARGIT-IORT could also benefit breast cancer patients with concurrent movement disorders like Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. Nonetheless, future studies are needed to reinforce its applicability for patients with DSS.",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology behind memory impairment in Parkinson's Disease Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI) is unclear. This study aims to investigate the hippocampal and cortical atrophy patterns in PD-MCI patients with different types of memory impairments, categorized as Retrieval Failure (RF) and Encoding Failure (EF).\nThe study included 16 healthy controls (HC) and 34 PD-MCI patients, divided into RF (N\u2009=\u200918) and EF (N\u2009=\u200916) groups based on their Verbal Memory Processes Test (VMPT) scores, including spontaneous recall, recognition, and Index of Sensitivity to Cueing (ISC). Hippocampal subfields and cortical thicknesses were measured using the FreeSurfer software for automatic segmentation.\nCompared to the HC group, the EF group exhibited significant atrophy in the left lateral occipital region and the right caudal middle frontal, superior temporal, and inferior temporal regions (p\u27e80.05). The RF group displayed significant atrophy in the left lateral occipital, middle temporal, and precentral regions, as well as the right pars orbitalis and superior frontal regions (p\u27e80.05). Hippocampal subfield analysis revealed distinct volume differences between HC-EF and RF-EF groups, with significant reductions in the CA1, CA3, and CA4 subregions in the EF group, but no differences between HC and RF groups (p\u2009>\u20090.05).\nGray matter atrophy patterns differ in PD-MCI patients with encoding and retrieval memory impairments. The significant hippocampal atrophy in the EF group, particularly in the CA subregions, highlights its potential role in disease progression and memory decline. Additionally, the convergence of atrophy in the lateral occipital cortex across both RF and EF groups suggests the involvement of the Parietal Memory Network (PMN) in PD-related memory impairment.",

    "abstract": "Pathological accumulation of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (aSYN) is a common feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanisms by which intracellular aSYN pathology contributes to dysfunction and degeneration of neurons in the brain are still unclear. A potentially relevant target of aSYN is the mitochondrion. To test this hypothesis, genetic and physiological methods were used to monitor mitochondrial function in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic and pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) cholinergic neurons after stereotaxic injection of aSYN pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) into the mouse brain.\naSYN PFFs were stereotaxically injected into the SNc or PPN of mice. Twelve weeks later, mice were studied using a combination of approaches, including immunocytochemical analysis, cell-type specific transcriptomic profiling, electron microscopy, electrophysiology and two-photon-laser-scanning microscopy of genetically encoded sensors for bioenergetic and redox status.\nIn addition to inducing a significant neuronal loss, SNc injection of PFFs induced the formation of intracellular, phosphorylated aSYN aggregates selectively in dopaminergic neurons. In these neurons, PFF-exposure decreased mitochondrial gene expression, reduced the number of mitochondria, increased oxidant stress, and profoundly disrupted mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production. Consistent with an aSYN-induced bioenergetic deficit, the autonomous spiking of dopaminergic neurons slowed or stopped. PFFs also up-regulated lysosomal gene expression and increased lysosomal abundance, leading to the formation of Lewy-like inclusions. Similar changes were observed in PPN cholinergic neurons following aSYN PFF exposure.\nTaken together, our findings suggest that disruption of mitochondrial function, and the subsequent bioenergetic deficit, is a proximal step in the cascade of events induced by aSYN pathology leading to dysfunction and degeneration of neurons at-risk in PD.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral immunity and neuroinflammation interact with each other and they play important roles in the pathophysiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). There have been very few real-world reports on the relationship between peripheral immune inflammation and motor phenotypes of IPD. This study aimed to investigate the potential correlation between peripheral inflammatory indicators and motor subtypes in patients with IPD.\nThis observational, prospective case-control study examined patients with IPD and healthy controls (HC) matched for age and sex between September 2021 and July 2023 at the Affiliated Huaian No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. The levels of peripheral inflammatory indicators were collected from each patient with IPD and HCs. Differences in the levels of peripheral inflammatory indicators among groups were compared. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to explore the inflammatory mechanism underlying the motor subtype of IPD.\nA total number of 94 patients with IPD were recruited at the Affiliated Huaian No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between September 2021 and July 2023, including 49 males and 45 females, and 37 healthy volunteers matched for age and sex were also enrolled as the control group. Of the 94 patients with IPD, 42.6% performed as the TD motor subtype and 57.4% performed as the AR motor subtype. NLR and the plasma levels of IL-1\u03b2and TNF-\u03b1 in the IPD group were higher than those in the HC group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The disease duration, Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) stage, NLR, and the levels of IL-1\u03b2 in the AR group were higher than those in the TD group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Additionally, IL-1\u03b2 plasma levels and NLR were positively correlated with disease duration, H-Y stage, movement disorder society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III motor score, and AR subtype. The binary logistic regression model revealed that the plasma level of IL-1\u03b2 was mildly associated with the AR motor subtype and NLR was strongly associated with the AR motor subtype. The combination of NLR and IL-1\u03b2 showed better performance in identifying the AR motor subtype.\nNLR is strongly associated with the AR motor subtype in IPD, and peripheral immunity is probably involved in the pathogenesis of AR motor subtype in IPD.",

    "abstract": "The Phase II trial of Anti-alpha-Synuclein Antibody in Early Parkinson's Disease (PASADENA) is an ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of prasinezumab in early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD). During the double-blind period, prasinezumab-treated individuals showed less progression of motor signs (Movement Disorders Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part\u2009III) than placebo-treated individuals. We evaluated whether the effect of prasinezumab on motor progression, assessed as a change in MDS-UPDRS Part\u2009III score in the OFF and ON states, and MDS-UPDRS Part\u2009II score, was sustained for 4\u2009years from the start of the trial. We compared participants enrolled in the PASADENA open-label extension study with those enrolled in an external comparator arm derived from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative observational study. The PASADENA delayed-start (n\u2009=\u200994) and early-start (n\u2009=\u2009177) groups showed a slower decline (a smaller increase in score) in MDS-UPDRS Part\u2009III scores in the OFF state (delayed start, -51%; early start, -65%), ON state (delayed start, -94%; early start, -118%) and MDS-UPDRS Part\u2009II (delayed start, -48%; early start, -40%) than did the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative external comparator (n\u2009=\u2009303). This exploratory analysis, which requires confirmation in future studies, suggested that the effect of prasinezumab in slowing motor progression in PD may be sustained long term.

    "abstract": "IMPHY000797 derivatives have been well known for their efficacy in various diseases. Moreover, IMPHY000797 derivatives have been found to modulate such genes involved in multiple neurological disorders. Hence, this study seeks to identify such genes and the probable molecular mechanism that could be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The study utilized various biological tools such as DisGeNET, STRING, Swiss target predictor, Cytoscape, AutoDock 4.2, Schrodinger suite, ClueGo, and GUSAR. All the reported genes were obtained using DisGeNET, and further, the common genes were incorporated into the STRING to get the KEGG pathway, and all the data was converted to a protein/pathway network via Cytoscape. The clustering of the genes was performed for the gene-enriched data using two-sided hypergeometrics (p-value). The binding affinity of the IMPHY000797 was verified with the highest regulated 25 proteins via utilizing the \"Monte Carlo iterated search technique\" and the \"Emodel and Glide score\" function. Three thousand five hundred eighty-three genes were identified for Parkinson's disease and 31 genes for IMPHY000797 compound, among which 25 common genes were identified. Further, the \"FOXO-signaling pathway\" was identified to be a modulated pathway. Among the 25 proteins, the highest modulated genes and highest binding affinity were exhibited by SIRT3, FOXO1, and PPARGC1A with the compound IMPHY000797. Further, rat toxicity analysis provided the efficacy and safety of the compound. The study was required to identify the probable molecular mechanism, which needs more confirmation from other studies, which is still a significant hit-back.",

    "abstract": "Profiling metagenomes against databases allows for the detection and quantification of microorganisms, even at low abundances where assembly is not possible. We introduce sylph, a species-level metagenome profiler that estimates genome-to-metagenome containment average nucleotide identity (ANI) through zero-inflated Poisson k-mer statistics, enabling ANI-based taxa detection. On the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation II (CAMI2) Marine dataset, sylph was the most accurate profiling method of seven tested. For multisample profiling, sylph took >10-fold less central processing unit time compared to Kraken2 and used 30-fold less memory. Sylph's ANI estimates provided an orthogonal signal to abundance, allowing for an ANI-based metagenome-wide association study for Parkinson disease (PD) against 289,232 genomes while confirming known butyrate-PD associations at the strain level. Sylph took <1\u2009min and 16\u2009GB of random-access memory to profile metagenomes against 85,205 prokaryotic and 2,917,516 viral genomes, detecting 30-fold more viral sequences in the human gut compared to RefSeq. Sylph offers precise, efficient profiling with accurate containment ANI estimation even for low-coverage genomes.",

    "abstract": "Lewy bodies (LBs), \u03b1-synuclein-enriched intracellular inclusions, are a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology, yet a cellular model for LB formation remains elusive. Recent evidence indicates that immune dysfunction may contribute to the development of PD. In this study, we found that induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human dopaminergic (DA) neurons form LB-like inclusions after treatment with \u03b1-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFFs) but only when coupled to a model of immune challenge (interferon-\u03b3 or interleukin-1\u03b2 treatment) or when co-cultured with activated microglia-like cells. Exposure to interferon-\u03b3 impairs lysosome function in DA neurons, contributing to LB formation. The knockdown of LAMP2 or the knockout of GBA in conjunction with PFF administration is sufficient for inclusion formation. Finally, we observed that the LB-like inclusions in iPSC-derived DA neurons are membrane bound, suggesting that they are not limited to the cytoplasmic compartment but may be formed due to dysfunctions in autophagy. Together, these data indicate that immune-triggered lysosomal dysfunction may contribute to the development of PD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders that affect the quality of human life of millions of people throughout the world. The probability of getting affected by this disease increases with age, and it is common among the elderly population. Early detection can help in initiating medications at an earlier stage. It can significantly slow down the progression of this disease, assisting the patient to maintain a good quality of life for a more extended period. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based brain imaging is an area of active research that is used to diagnose PD disease early and to understand the key biomarkers. The prior research investigations using MRI data mainly focus on volume, structural, and morphological changes in the basal ganglia (BG) region for diagnosing PD. Recently, researchers have emphasized the significance of studying other areas of the human brain for a more comprehensive understanding of PD and also to analyze changes happening in brain tissue. Thus, to perform accurate diagnosis and treatment planning for early identification of PD, this work focuses on learning the onset of PD from images taken from whole-brain MRI using a novel 3D-convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) deep learning architecture. The conventional 3D-Resent deep learning model, after various hyper-parameter tuning and architectural changes, has achieved an accuracy of 90%. In this work, a novel 3D-CNN architecture was developed, and after several ablation studies, the model yielded results with an improved accuracy of 93.4%. Combining features from the 3D-CNN and 3D ResNet models using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) resulted in 95% accuracy. For further enhancements of the model performance, feature fusion with optimization was employed, utilizing various optimization techniques. Whale optimization based on a biologically inspired approach was selected on the basis of a convergence diagram. The performance of this approach is compared to other methods and has given an accuracy of 97%. This work represents a critical advancement in improving PD diagnosis techniques and emphasizing the importance of deep nested 3D learning and bio-inspired feature selection.",

    "abstract": "The primary pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, a critical midbrain region. In vitro models based on DA neurons provide a powerful platform for investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of PD and testing novel therapeutic strategies. A deep understanding of DA neuron development, including the signalling pathways and transcription factors involved, is essential for advancing PD research. This article first explores the differentiation and maturation processes of DA neurons in the midbrain, detailing the relevant signalling pathways. It then compares various in vitro models, including primary cells, immortalized cell lines, and stem cell-based models, focusing on the advantages and limitations of each. Special attention is given to the role of immortalized and stem cell models in PD research. This review aims to guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate model for their specific research goals. Ethical considerations and clinical implications of using stem cells in PD research are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact sites (MERCS) function as transient signaling platforms that regulate essential cellular functions. MERCS are enriched in specific proteins and lipids that connect mitochondria and the ER together and modulate their activities. Dysregulation of MERCS is associated with several human pathologies including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and cancer. BCL-2 family proteins can locate at MERCS and control essential cellular functions such as calcium signaling and autophagy in addition to their role in mitochondrial apoptosis. Moreover, the BCL-2-mediated apoptotic machinery was recently found to trigger cGAS-STING pathway activation and a proinflammatory response, a recognized hallmark of these diseases that requires mitochondria-ER interplay. This review underscores the pivotal role of MERCS in regulating essential cellular functions, focusing on their crosstalk with BCL-2 family proteins, and discusses how their dysregulation is linked to disease.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are often accompanied by dementia, motor dysfunction, or disability. Caring for these patients imposes a significant psychological and financial burden on families. Until now, there are no effective methods for the treatment of NDs. Among them, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most common. Recently, studies have revealed that the overexpression of certain genes may be linked to the occurrence of AD and PD. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are a powerful tool for gene silencing because they can specifically bind to and cleave target mRNA. However, the intrinsic properties of naked siRNA and various physiological barriers limit the application of siRNA in the brain. Nanotechnology is a promising option for addressing these issues. Nanoparticles are not only able to protect siRNA from degradation but also have the advantage of crossing various physiological barriers to reach the brain target of siRNA. In this review, we aim to introduce diverse nanotechnology used for delivering siRNA to treat AD and PD. Finally, we will briefly discuss our perspectives on this promising field.",

    "abstract": "The multifaceted nature of the neurodegenerative diseases, as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) with several interconnected etiologies, and the absence of effective drugs, led herein to the development and study of a series of multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs). The developed RIV-IND hybrids, derived from the conjugation of an approved anti-AD drug, rivastigmine (RIV), with melatonin analogues, namely indole (IND) derivatives, revealed multifunctional properties, by associating the cholinesterase inhibition of the RIV drug with antioxidant activity, biometal (Cu(II), Zn(II), Fe(III)) chelation properties, inhibition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) aggregation (self- and Cu-induced) and of monoamine oxidases (MAOs), as well as neuroprotection capacity in cell models of AD and PD. In particular, two hybrids with hydroxyl-substituted indoles (5a2 and 5a3) could be promising multifunctional compounds that inspire further development of novel anti-neurodegenerative drugs.",

    "abstract": "The common structural interpretation of diffusion color-encoded (DCE) maps assumes that the brain is aligned with the gradients of the MRI machine. This is seldom achieved in the field, leading to incorrect red (R), green (G) and blue (B) DCE values for the expected orientation of fiber bundles. We studied the virtual reorientation of gradients according to the anterior commissure - posterior commissure (ACPC) system on the RGB derivatives.\nWe measured mean \u00b1 standard deviation of average, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of RGB derivatives, before (rO) and after (acpcO) gradient reorientation, in one healthy-subject group with head routinely positioned (HS-routine), and in two patient groups, one with essential tremor (ET-Opti), and one with Parkinson's disease (PD-Opti), with head position optimized according to ACPC before acquisition. We studied the pitch, roll and yaw angles of reorientation, and we compared rO and acpcO conditions, and groups (ad hoc statistics).\nPitch (maximum in the HS-routine group) was greater than roll and yaw. After reorientation of gradients, in the HS-routine group, DCE average increased, and Stddev, skewness and kurtosis decreased; R, G and B average increased, and R and B skewness and kurtosis decreased. By contrast, in the ET-Opti group and the PD-Opti group, R, G and B, average and Stddev increased, and skewness and kurtosis decreased. In both rO and acpcO conditions, in the ET-Opti and PD-Opti groups, average and standard deviation were higher, while skewness and kurtosis were lower.\nDCE map interpretability depends on brain orientation. Reorientation realigns gradients with the anatomic and physiologic position of the head and brain, as exemplified.",

    "abstract": "Indian Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients are severely underrepresented in terms of genetic studies and little is known about the frequency of variants and their impact on motor and nonmotor symptoms (NMS).\nThis retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in PD patients undergoing treatment at a tertiary care hospital from India. Patients were advised genetic testing if they had (i) age at onset (AAO) of motor symptoms at or before 50 years (EOPD), (ii) positive family history of PD, parkinsonism or dystonia. All patients underwent whole exome sequencing and potentially pathogenic variants were identified.\nClinical and genetic data were available for 230 (163 males, 70.4\u00a0%) patients. Thirty-five pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in various PD genes were identified in 47 patients resulting in a yield of 20.4\u00a0%. In the remaining, 82 patients had either variants of uncertain significance or had variants in genes not associated with parkinsonism and 101 patients did not have any non-benign variants. Patients with genetically mediated PD had a lower AAO and statistically greater frequency of dystonia (36.2\u00a0%), postural instability (29.8\u00a0%) and mood disorder (29.8\u00a0%) and a higher Hoehn and Yahr score (2.9). Among the 47 patients, 11 patients had PARK-PRKN, six patients had PARK-PLA2G6, and 22 patients had PARK-GBA1.\nAround one-fifth of early-onset PD can have an underlying monogenetic cause. PARK-GBA1, PARK-PRKN and PARK-PLA2G6 are the commoner causes of genetically mediated PD in India. Patients with genetic cause had an earlier age at onset, and more frequent dystonia, postural instability and dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "Chitosan nanoparticles have emerged as a promising therapeutic platform for treating neurological disorders due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ease of functionalization. One of the significant challenges in treating neurological conditions is overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which restricts the effective delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. Addressing this barrier is crucial for the successful treatment of various neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, migraine, psychotic disorders, and brain tumors. Chitosan nanoparticles offer several advantages: they enhance drug absorption, protect drugs from degradation, and enable targeted delivery. These properties open new possibilities for non-invasive therapies for neurological conditions. Numerous studies have highlighted the neuroprotective potential of chitosan nanoparticles, demonstrating improved outcomes in animal models of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Additionally, surface modifications of these nanoparticles allow for the attachment of specific ligands or molecules, enhancing the precision of drug delivery to neuronal cells. Despite these advancements, several challenges persist in the clinical translation of chitosan nanoparticles. Issues such as large-scale production, regulatory hurdles, and the need for further research into long-term safety must be addressed. This review explores recent advancements in the use of chitosan nanoparticles for managing neurological disorders and outlines potential future directions in this rapidly evolving field of research.",

    "abstract": "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), an FDA-approved treatment for movement disorders such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), is increasingly used for various neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Bahadori et al. highlighted a significant increase in Body Mass Index (BMI) among patients post-DBS, with most participants having PD. The study, however, noted moderate heterogeneity (I\u00b2 = 67.566%) without thoroughly addressing its potential causes or proposing strategies to mitigate it. The review's limited patient diversity and short follow-up period also challenge its generalizability and long-term implications. In addition to BMI changes, DBS has been linked to motor, cognitive, and psychiatric side effects. Patients undergoing subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation, for example, face risks of motor complications, including speech and gait issues, while cognitive declines, particularly in verbal fluency and executive function, are also concerning. Psychiatric side effects such as depression, anxiety, and psychosis further complicate treatment outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of personalized treatment strategies, preoperative assessments, and ongoing patient education to minimize adverse effects and optimize the therapeutic potential of DBS.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis presents a significant global health challenge. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms underlying these conditions remain elusive, with current treatments primarily addressing symptoms rather than root causes. Emerging evidence suggests that gut permeability and the kynurenine pathway are involved in the pathogenesis of these neurological conditions, offering promising targets for novel therapeutic and preventive strategies. Gut permeability refers to the intestinal lining's ability to selectively allow essential nutrients into the bloodstream while blocking harmful substances. Various factors, including poor diet, stress, infections, and genetic predispositions, can compromise gut integrity, leading to increased permeability. This condition facilitates the translocation of toxins and bacteria into systemic circulation, triggering widespread inflammation that impacts neurological health via the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex communication network between the gut and the central nervous system. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiota, can increase gut permeability and systemic inflammation, exacerbating neuroinflammation-a key factor in neurological disorders. The kynurenine pathway, the primary route for tryptophan metabolism, is significantly implicated in this process. Dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway in the context of inflammation leads to the production of neurotoxic metabolites, such as quinolinic acid, which contribute to neuronal damage and the progression of neurological disorders. This narrative review highlights the potential and progress in understanding these mechanisms. Interventions targeting the kynurenine pathway and maintaining a balanced gut microbiota through diet, probiotics, and lifestyle modifications show promise in reducing neuroinflammation and supporting brain health. In addition, pharmacological approaches aimed at modulating the kynurenine pathway directly, such as inhibitors of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, offer potential avenues for new treatments. Understanding and targeting these interconnected pathways are crucial for developing effective strategies to prevent and manage neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Controlling the polymorphic assemblies of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) oligomers is crucial to reroute toxic protein aggregation implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). One potential mediator is the interaction of \u03b1S tetramers with cell membranes, which may regulate the dynamic balance between aggregation-prone disordered monomers and aggregation-resistant helical tetramers. Here, we model diverse tetramer-cell interactions and compare the structure-function relations at the supramolecular-biological interface with available experimental data. The models predict preferential interaction of compact \u03b1S tetramers with highly charged membrane surfaces, which may further stabilize this aggregation-resistant conformer. On moderately charged membranes, extended structures are preferred. In addition to surface charge, curvature influences tetramer thermodynamic stability and aggregation, with potential for selective isolation of tetramers ",

    "abstract": "When re-learning a motor skill, practicing a variety of treatment targets promotes error processing and the exploration of motor control strategies, which initially disrupts accuracy during training (motor performance), but ultimately enhances generalization, retention, and transfer (motor learning). Cough skill training (CST) is feasible and efficacious to improve cough strength; however, previous studies have used the same practice target during training.\nOur goal was to examine the impact of CST with variable practice on motor performance, motor learning, and respiratory system adaptations.\nThe study was a prospective three-visit single group design. Twenty individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and concomitant dysphagia and dystussia completed two sessions of CST involving three randomized practice targets. Cough, lung volume, and airway clearance outcomes were assessed before and after treatment sessions with long-term retention evaluated after 1\u2009month.\nPeak expiratory flow rate improved after CST with variable practice for voluntary single (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.35\u2009L/s) and sequential (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.22\u2009L/s) cough, which were maintained after 1\u2009month without treatment. The ability to expel material from the upper airway demonstrated a small magnitude of improvement (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-1.87%). During CST, participants altered lung volume based on the treatment target and lung volume decreased during reflex cough after completing CST.\nIndividuals with PD demonstrated improvements in several aspects of motor learning after two sessions of CST with variable practice. Increasing lung volume may not be an implicit strategy to upregulate voluntary cough strength in this treatment paradigm. The findings support the need for larger investigations exploring the potential benefits of this CST approach.",

    "abstract": "Poor sleep quality might contribute to the risk and progression of neurodegenerative disorders via deficient cerebral waste clearance functions during sleep. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we explore the link between enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), a putative marker of sleep-dependent glymphatic clearance, with sleep quality and motor symptoms in Parkinson`s disease (PD) patients. T2-weighted MRI images of 20 patients and 17 healthy control subjects were estimated visually for PVS in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO). The patient group additionally underwent a single-night polysomnography. Readouts included polsyomnographic sleep features and slow-wave activity (SWA), a quantitative EEG marker of sleep depth. Associations between PVS counts, PD symptoms (MDS-UPDRS scores) and sleep parameters were evaluated using correlation and regression analyses. Intra- and inter-rater reproducibility was assessed with weighted Cohen`s kappa coefficient. BG and CSO PVS counts in both patients and controls did not differ significantly between groups. In patients, PVS in both brain regions were negatively associated with SWA (1-2Hz) (BG: r(15)=-0.58, padj=0.015 and CSO: r(15)=-0.6, padj=0.015). Basal ganglia PVS counts were positively associated with motor symptoms of daily living (IRR=1.05, CI [1.01, 1.09], p=0.007, padj=0.026) and antidepressant use (IRR=1.37, CI [1.05, 1.80], p=0.021, padj=0.043) after controlling for age. Centrum Semiovale PVS counts in patients were positively associated with a diagnosis of REM sleep behaviour disorder (IRR=1.39, CI [1.06 , 1.84]), p=0.018, padj=0.11). These results add evidence that sleep deterioration may play a role in impairing glymphatic clearance via altered perivascular function, potentially contributing to disease severity in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Methylation, a key epigenetic modification, is essential for regulating gene expression and protein function without altering the DNA sequence, contributing to various biological processes, including gene transcription, embryonic development, and cellular functions. Methylation encompasses DNA methylation, RNA methylation and histone modification. Recent research indicates that DNA methylation is vital for establishing and maintaining normal brain functions by modulating the high-order structure of DNA. Alterations in the patterns of DNA methylation can exert significant impacts on both gene expression and cellular function, playing a role in the development of numerous diseases, such as neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases as well as cancer. Our current understanding of the etiology of neurological diseases emphasizes a multifaceted process that includes neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory, and neurovascular events. Epigenetic modifications, especially DNA methylation, are fundamental in the control of gene expression and are critical in the onset and progression of neurological disorders. Furthermore, we comprehensively overview the role and mechanism of DNA methylation in in various biological processes and gene regulation in neurological diseases. Understanding the mechanisms and dynamics of DNA methylation in neural development can provide valuable insights into human biology and potentially lead to novel therapies for various neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "Copper (Cu) is a vital micronutrient necessary for proper development and function of mammalian cells and tissues. Cu mediates the function of redox active enzymes that facilitate metabolic processes and signaling pathways. Cu levels are tightly regulated by a network of Cu-binding transporters, chaperones, and small molecule ligands. Extensive research has focused on the mammalian Cu homeostasis (cuprostasis) network, and pathologies which result from mutations and perturbations. There are roles for Cu-binding proteins as transcription factors (Cu-TFs) and regulators that mediate metal homeostasis through the activation or repression of genes associated with Cu handling. Emerging evidence, suggests that Cu and some Cu-TFs may be involved in the regulation of targets related to development-expanding the biological roles of Cu-binding proteins. Cu and Cu-TFs are implicated in embryonic and tissue-specific development alongside the mediation of the cellular response to oxidative stress and hypoxia. Cu-TFs are also involved in the regulation of targets implicated in neurologic disorders, providing new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for diseases such as Parkinson's disease, prion disease, and Friedreich's ataxia. This review provides a critical analysis of the current understanding of the role of Cu and cuproproteins in transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "The development of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for neurological disorders is an important goal in modern neurology, and the associated challenges are similar in many chronic neurological conditions. Major advances have been made in the multiple sclerosis (MS) field, with a range of DMTs being approved for relapsing MS and the introduction of the first DMTs for progressive MS. By contrast, people with Parkinson disease (PD) still lack such treatment options, relying instead on decades-old therapeutic approaches that provide only\u00a0symptomatic relief. To address this unmet need, an in-person symposium was held in Toronto, Canada, in November 2022 for international researchers and experts in MS and PD to discuss strategies for advancing DMT development. In this Roadmap article, we highlight discussions from the symposium, which focused on therapeutic targets and preclinical models, disease spectra and subclassifications, and clinical trial design and outcome measures. From these discussions, we propose areas for novel or deeper exploration in PD using lessons learned from therapeutic development in MS. In addition, we identify challenges common to the PD and MS fields that need to be addressed to further advance the discovery and development of effective DMTs.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) experience reduced voice intensity and dysphagia. Organs related to voice production and swallowing are structurally and neurologically intertwined. Thus, instrumental voice assessment may be useful in identifying voice impairments that can show swallowing disorders. Timely assessment of swallowing disorders may prevent the occurrence of malnutrition, dehydration, pneumonia, and death.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between voice intensity and swallowing function in PD.\n30 participants with PD were recruited. Motor disability was evaluated by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III; voice intensity was assessed by PRAAT software during sustained /a/ and 1\u00a0min of monologue. The Penetration Aspiration Scale, the Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale, and the Videofluoroscopic Dysphagia Scale were used to assess swallowing during videofluoroscopy. Spearman correlation coefficients, logistic, and linear models were used to analyze data.\nVoice intensity correlated with swallowing: as voice intensity decreased, swallowing function deteriorated (Spearman coefficients from -0.42 to -0.72 across scales), and this holds even when adjusted for MDS-UPDRS motor scores. Swallowing impairment is 56 times more likely (p<0.01) when the voice intensity is below the normal cut-off score (60 dB) with a positive predictive value of 93%.\nReduction in voice intensity is indicative of a higher risk of swallowing dysfunction. Thus, an instrumental voice analysis seems to be a non-invasive, lowcost, easy-to-use tool to identify people with PD in need of an assessment to allow for timely swallowing management and reduction of complications caused by dysphagia.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) into amyloid fibrils, a key process in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies, is influenced by a range of factors such as charged biopolymers, chaperones, and metabolites. However, the specific impacts of different biopolymers on \u03b1-syn fibril structure are not well understood. In our work, we found that different polyanions and polycations, such as polyphosphate (polyP), polyuridine (polyU), and polyamines (including putrescine, spermidine, and spermine), markedly altered the fibrillation kinetics of \u03b1-syn in vitro. Furthermore, seeding assay revealed distinct cross-seeding capacities across different biopolymer-induced \u03b1-syn fibrils, suggesting the formation of structurally distinct strains under different conditions. Utilizing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we further examined the detailed structural configuration of \u03b1-syn fibrils formed in the presence of these biopolymers. Notably, we found that while polyamines do not change the atomic structure of \u03b1-syn fibrils, polyU and polyP induce the formation of distinct amyloid fibrils, exhibiting a range of structural polymorphs. Our work offers valuable insights into how various charged biopolymers affect the aggregation process and the resultant structures of \u03b1-syn fibrils, thereby enhancing our understanding of the structural variations in \u03b1-syn fibrils across different pathological conditions.",

    "abstract": "to determine the effects of aerobic training in randomized controlled clinical trials on functional capacity, motor symptoms, and oxygen consumption in individuals with PD through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.\nPUBMED, Web of Science, CINAHL, SciELO, and Medline databases were searched to identify published studies until September 2023.\nRandomized controlled clinical trials that evaluated the long-term effect of aerobic exercise in individuals with PD were included.\nTwo independent reviewers extracted the data, assessed the risk of bias and the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). In case of disagreement, a third reviewer was consulted.\n13 studies were included in the systematic review and the number of participants was 588 with an average age of 66.2 years (57 to 73 years). The study's exercise intervention lasted between 6 to 70 weeks, with most studies lasting 10-12 weeks, with three sessions/week and an average duration of 47 minutes/session. The meta-analysis revealed that aerobic exercise is effective in enhancing maximal oxygen uptake (SMD 0.42 [CI95%\u202f=\u202f0.18, 0.66; p\u202f=\u202f0.0007]) and functional capacity (SMD 0.48 [CI95%\u202f=\u202f0.24-0.71; p < 0.0001]). In addition, aerobic exercise can reduce the UPDRS III (mean difference -2.48 [CI95%\u202f=\u202f-3.16, -1.81; p < 0.00001]) score in individuals with PD.\nAerobic exercise training conducted 2 to 3 times a week, with different intensities (low to high) can be an effective intervention for enhancing functional capacity, maximizing oxygen uptake, and reducing the UPDRS scores in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).",

Gp I was used as the control group, and the remaining animals received MnCl\nZC and/or PUN reversed the depletion of monoamines in the brain and decreased acetyl choline esterase activity, which primarily adjusted the animals' behavior and motor coordination. ZC and PUN restored the balance between glutamate/\u03b3-amino butyric acid content and markedly improved the brain levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 and decreased glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta activity. ZC and PUN also inhibited inflammatory and oxidative markers, including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, Toll-like receptor 4, nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 and caspase-1. Bcl-2-associated X-protein and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2) can significantly modify caspase-3 expression. ZC and/or PUN ameliorated PD in rats by decreasing the levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (p-protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), glucose-regulated protein 78, and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)) and enhancing the levels of an autophagy marker (Beclin-1).\nZC and/or PUN mitigated the progression of PD through their potential neurotrophic, neurogenic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic activities and by controlling ER stress through modulation of the PERK/CHOP/Bcl-2 pathway.",

    "results": "ZC and/or PUN reversed the depletion of monoamines in the brain and decreased acetyl choline esterase activity, which primarily adjusted the animals' behavior and motor coordination. ZC and PUN restored the balance between glutamate/\u03b3-amino butyric acid content and markedly improved the brain levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 and decreased glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta activity. ZC and PUN also inhibited inflammatory and oxidative markers, including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, Toll-like receptor 4, nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 and caspase-1. Bcl-2-associated X-protein and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2) can significantly modify caspase-3 expression. ZC and/or PUN ameliorated PD in rats by decreasing the levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (p-protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), glucose-regulated protein 78, and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)) and enhancing the levels of an autophagy marker (Beclin-1).",

    "abstract": "An accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains challenging and the exact cause of the disease is unclean. The aims are to identify hub genes associated with the complement system in PD and to explore their underlying molecular mechanisms. Initially, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and key module genes related to PD were mined through differential expression analysis and WGCNA. Then, differentially expressed CSRGs (DE-CSRGs) were obtained by intersecting the DEGs, key module genes and CSRGs. Subsequently, MR analysis was executed to identify genes causally associated with PD. Based on genes with significant MR results, the expression level and diagnostic performance verification were achieved to yield hub genes. Functional enrichment and immune infiltration analyses were accomplished to insight into the pathogenesis of PD. qRT-PCR was employed to evaluate the expression levels of hub genes. After MR analysis and related verification, CD93, CTSS, PRKCD and TLR2 were finally identified as hub genes. Enrichment analysis indicated that the main enriched pathways for hub genes. Immune infiltration analysis found that the hub genes showed significant correlation with a variety of immune cells (such as myeloid-derived suppressor cell and macrophage). In the qRT-PCR results, the expression levels of CTSS, PRKCD and TLR2 were consistent with those we obtained from public databases. Hence, we mined four hub genes associated with complement system in PD which provided novel perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Stimulation of a specific site in the dorsolateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) was recently associated with slower motor progression in Parkinson's Disease (PD), based on the deep brain stimulation (DBS) in early-stage PD pilot clinical\u00a0trial. Here, subject-level visualizations are presented of this early-stage PD dataset to further describe the relationship between active contacts and motor progression. This study also evaluates whether stimulation of the sweet spot and connectivity model associated with slower motor progression is also\u00a0associated with improvements in long-term motor outcomes in patients with advanced-stage PD.\nActive contacts of the early-stage PD cohort (N\u2009=\u200914) were analyzed alongside the degree of two-year motor progression. Sweet spot and connectivity models derived from the early-stage PD cohort were then used to determine how well they can estimate the variance in\u00a0long-term motor outcomes in an independent STN-DBS cohort of advanced-stage PD patients (N\u2009=\u200929).\nIn early-stage PD, proximity of stimulation to the dorsolateral STN was\u00a0associated with slower motor progression. In advanced-stage PD, stimulation proximity to the early PD connectivity model and sweet spot were associated with better long-term motor outcomes (R\u2009=\u20090.60, P\u2009<\u20090.001; R\u2009=\u20090.37, P\u2009=\u20090.046, respectively).\nResults suggest stimulation of a specific site in the dorsolateral STN is\u00a0associated with both slower motor progression and long-term motor improvements in PD.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms in particular impair health-related quality of life (QoL) of patients with Parkinson's disease and atypical Parkinsonian syndromes. For this reason, various scales have been developed for detection of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as the Scale for evaluation of neuropsychiatric disorders in Parkinson's disease (SEND-PD).\nFirst, the objective of this study was to explore the interrelation between the SEND-PD and clinical parameters in patients with Parkinson's disease and thus confirm its validity. In addition, the applicability in a well-defined cohort of patients with atypical Parkinsonian syndromes was investigated for the very first time.\nA clinically well-defined cohort of 122 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 55 patients with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and 33 patients with Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) were analyzed. First, the SEND-PD was correlated with established disease-specific scores in patients with PD. Next, the results of the SEND-PD were compared between the different Parkinsonian syndromes.\nThe SEND-PD showed a strong significant correlation with several scores, especially the UPDRS I (Rho = 0.655) and GDS-15 (Rho = 0.645). Depressive burden was significantly higher in MSA patients in comparison to the PD patient cohort (PD, 3.8 \u00b1 3.3; MSA, 5.45 \u00b1 3.87), while PSP patients showed significantly less psychotic (PD 1.6 \u00b1 2.1; PSP 0.6 \u00b1 0.9) and impulse control disorders (PD 0.3 \u00b1 1.0; PSP 0.02 \u00b1 0.1).\nThe SEND-PD is a useful, brief and highly applicable screening tool for neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD, but not in atypical Parkinsonism, as their unique neuropsychiatric symptom composition is not fully captured.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) who undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery could benefit from remote programming (RP), which has proven to be both effective and economical. However, there is limited research on PwPD with DBS implants who have completed all programming sessions exclusively through remote means (full remote programming, FRP). This case report documents the experiences of five PwPD who underwent FRP, with four demonstrating improvements in motor symptoms, quality of life, and medication reduction. A total of 22 postoperative programming sessions were conducted, all via RP. FRP integrates RP with online consultations. Our findings contribute preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility and safety of FRP in the postoperative care of PwPD with DBS implants.",

    "abstract": "One of the unifying pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the presence of misfolded, aggregated, and often phosphorylated forms of the protein \u03b1-synuclein in neurons. \u03b1-Synuclein pathology appears in select populations of neurons throughout various cortical and subcortical regions, and little is currently known about why some neurons develop pathology while others are spared. Here, we utilized subcellular-resolution imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (IST) in a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses wild-type human \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn-tg) to evaluate patterns of selective neuronal vulnerability to \u03b1-synuclein pathology. By performing post-IST immunofluorescence for \u03b1-synuclein phosphorylated at Ser129 (pSyn), we identified cell types in the cortex and hippocampus that were vulnerable or resistant to developing pSyn pathology. Next, we investigated the transcriptional underpinnings of the observed selective vulnerability using a set of custom probes to detect genes involved in \u03b1-synuclein processing and toxicity. We identified expression of the kinase:substrate pair ",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the feasibility of employing a pre-trained deep learning wave-to-vec model for speech-to-text analysis in individuals with speech disorders arising from Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA publicly available dataset containing speech recordings including the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) staging, Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part I, UPDRS Part II scores, and gender information from both healthy controls (HC) and those diagnosed with PD was utilized. Employing the Wav2Vec model, a speech-to-text analysis method was implemented on PD patient data. Tasks conducted included word letter classification, word match probability assessment, and analysis of speech waveform characteristics as provided by the model's output.\nFor the dataset comprising 20 cases, among individuals with PD, the H&Y score averaged 2.50\u00b10.67, the UPDRS II-part 5 score averaged 0.70\u00b11.00, and the UPDRS III-part 18 score averaged 0.80\u00b10.98. Additionally, the number of words derived from decoded text subsequent to speech recognition was evaluated, resulting in mean values of 299.10\u00b116.79 and 259.80\u00b193.39 for the HC and PD groups, respectively. Furthermore, the calculated degree of agreement for all syllables was based on the speech process. The accuracy for the reading sentences was observed to be 0.31 and 0.10, respectively.\nThis study aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of wave-to-vec in enhancing speech-to-text analysis for patients with speech disorders.

    "abstract": "Polymethyl methacrylate, commonly known as bone cement, is widely used for implant fixation in orthopedic and trauma surgery due to its excellent adhesive properties and biocompatibility. However, complications such as bone cement extrusion, although rare, can lead to significant morbidity. We present the case of an 86-year-old Hispanic female who presented to the emergency department (ED) with tachycardia, hypertension, and respiratory distress. Her medical history included Parkinson's disease, hiatal hernia, osteoarthritis, colon cancer, and a complex post-hip fracture surgical history. Despite being bedridden, she had been previously in stable health. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a significant hiatal hernia, minimal remaining left lung tissue, a right lung nodule, hydronephrosis, and a large radiopaque mass in the right pelvis extending from the acetabular area. This radiopaque mass was later determined to be bone cement, with a portion extruding into the bladder. The patient was diagnosed with sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection and hyponatremia; a urology consultation recommended a conservative approach to avoid potential antibiotic resistance. This case report highlights a rare complication of total hip arthroplasty involving bone cement extrusion into the bladder, which led to hydronephrosis and a urinary tract infection (UTI). Although such complications can be asymptomatic, they should be considered in patients with a history of arthroplasty.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregates. The A53T missense point mutation occurs in autosomal dominant familial PD and has been found to promote the aggregation of \u03b1-syn. To investigate the role of the A53T mutation in PD, researchers have developed various mouse models with this mutation.\nWe therefore conducted a comprehensive characterization of the tg(THY1-SNCA*A53T)M53Sud mouse model (hA53Ttg mice) for its motor and pathological features.\nhA53Ttg mice were tested for motor impairments in a series of motor tests at 2, 4 or 6\u2009months of age. Human \u03b1-syn and \u03b1-syn pSer129, as well as GFAP and Iba1 signal were labeled and quantified in the cortex, hippocampus, and brainstem. Neurofilament light chain (NF-L) levels were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. \nBehavioral tests revealed early muscle weakness and motor impairments that progressed with age. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated elevated levels of human \u03b1-syn and \u03b1-syn pSer129 in all evaluated brain regions. \u03b1-syn pSer129 labeling further revealed fiber-like structures in the cortex of older animals. Neuroinflammation was observed in an age-dependent manner. Biochemical evaluation revealed elevated NF-L levels in the plasma and CSF. Overall, our findings highlight the value of hA53Ttg mice in modeling PD-associated pathologies that closely resemble those observed in PD patients.\nOur results thus suggest that hA53Ttg mice are a useful tool for studying the underlying mechanisms of PD.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders necessitate comprehensive palliative care due to their progressive and irreversible nature. Limited studies have explored the comprehensive assessment needs of this population. This present study is designed to develop a checklist for evaluating the palliative care needs of individuals with motor neuron disease (MND) and Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe checklist was created through an extensive literature review and discussions with stakeholders in neuropalliative. Feedback from six field experts led to the finalisation of the checklist, which comprised 53 items addressing the unique biopsychosocial needs of MND and PD. Sixty patient-caregiver dyads receiving treatment in a tertiary referral care centre for neurology in south India completed the checklist.\nPeople with MND had more identified needs with speech, swallowing, and communication, while people with PD reported needs in managing tremors, reduced movements, and subjective feelings of stiffness. People denying the severity of the illness was found to be a major psychosocial issue. The checklist addresses the dearth of specific tools for assessing palliative care needs in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly MND and PD. By incorporating disease-specific and generic items, the checklist offers a broad assessment of patients' multidimensional needs.\nThis study contributes to the area of neuropalliative care by developing the neuropalliative care needs checklist (NPCNC) as a valuable tool for assessing the needs of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases. Future research should focus on refining and validating the NPCNC with larger and more diverse groups, applicability in different contexts, and investigating its sensitivity to changes over time.",

    "abstract": "The rising prevalence of multimorbidity and functional dependence in community-dwelling older adults contribute to the demand for home care services. Evidence on how chronic conditions, especially multimorbidity, affect dependence levels among older adults with functional dependence in a socio-cultural context is much needed to inform policy, workforce, aged care service development to meet the care needs of this population.\nThis study aimed to determine the association between chronic conditions, multimorbidity and dependence levels among Chinese community-dwelling older adults with functional dependence.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,235 community-dwelling older adults with functional dependence in Hunan province, China, from June to October 2018. Data on socio-demographic factors, cognitive function, vision and hearing conditions, activities of daily living (ADLs), and health conditions were collected, and binary logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between chronic conditions, multimorbidity and dependence levels, with adjustments for relevant covariates.\nAmong the participants, 62.9% had multimorbidity. Parkinson's disease, stroke, COPD, hypertension, mood and psychotic disorders (Anx/Sch/Dep) were significantly associated with high levels of functional dependence. After adjusting for demographic variables, cognitive function, vision, and hearing conditions, we observed a significant relationship between multimorbidity and higher functional dependence, but this association became insignificant when including certain chronic diseases closely associated with high-level dependence. Study revealed that Parkinson's disease and stroke notably increase dependency risk across seven ADL domains, demonstrating their extensive impact on daily functioning.\nThe prevalence of multimorbidity among Chinese community-dwelling older adults with functional dependence is very high. The association of multimorbidity with functional dependence is mediated by specific chronic conditions. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting an integrated care model that combines medical and social care, with a particular emphasis on managing multimorbidity and critical chronic conditions that lead to severe functional dependence to preventing and diminish the onset of disabilities.",

    "abstract": "Higher physical activity levels have been suggested as a potential modifiable risk factor for lowering the risk of incident Parkinson's disease (PD). This study uses objective measures of physical activity to investigate the role of reverse causation in the observed association.\nTo investigate the association between accelerometer-derived daily step count and incident PD, and to assess the impact of reverse causation on this association.\nThis prospective cohort study involved a follow-up period with a median duration of 7.9 years, with participants who wore wrist-worn accelerometers for up to 7 days.\nThe study was conducted within the UK Biobank, a large, population-based cohort.\nThe analysis included 94,696 participants aged 43-78 years (56% female) from the UK Biobank who provided valid accelerometer data and did not have prevalent PD.\nDaily step counts were derived using machine learning models to determine the median daily step count over the monitoring period.\nThe primary outcome was incident PD, identified through hospital admission and death records. Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between daily step count and incident PD, with adjustments for various covariates and evaluation of reverse causation by splitting follow-up periods.\nDuring a median follow-up of 7.9 years (IQR: 7.4-8.4), 407 incident PD cases were identified. An inverse linear association was observed between daily step count and incident PD. Participants in the highest quintile of daily steps (>12,369 steps) had an HR of 0.41 (95% CI 0.31-0.54) compared to the lowest quintile (<6,276 steps; HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.84-1.19). A per 1,000 step increase was associated with an HR of 0.92 (95% CI 0.89-0.94). However, after excluding the first six years of follow-up, the association was not significant (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-1.01).\nThe observed association between higher daily step count and lower incident PD is likely influenced by reverse causation, suggesting changes in physical activity levels occur years before PD diagnosis. While step counts may serve as a predictor for PD, they may not represent a modifiable risk factor. Further research with extended follow-up periods is warranted to better understand this relationship and account for reverse causation.",

    "abstract": "Multiple scientific studies, mostly performed within European populations, have unraveled many of the genetic factors associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) etiologies, improving our understanding of the molecular pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of these conditions. However, there is increasing evidence that the genetic architecture of these diseases differs across ancestral populations. This raises concerns about the efficacy of therapeutic interventions crafted around genetic targets prevalent only in European ancestry populations. Such interventions neglect potentially distinctive etiological profiles, including Latino, Black/African American, and East Asian populations. In the current study, we explore Population Attributable Risk (PAR) in AD and PD etiologies and assess the proportion of disease attributed to specific genetic factors across diverse populations. Leveraging data from genome-wide association studies across four ancestries, we explore distinct and universal therapeutic targets across diverse populations. Multi-ancestral genetics research is critical to the development of successful therapeutics and treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. By offering insights into genetic disparities, we aim to inform more inclusive and effective therapeutic strategies, advancing personalized healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Using data from UK Biobank, SAIL Biobank, and FinnGen, we conducted an unbiased, population-scale study to: 1) Investigate how 155 endocrine, nutritional, metabolic, and digestive system disorders are associated with AD and PD risk prior to their diagnosis, considering known genetic influences; 2) Assess plasma biomarkers' specificity for AD or PD in individuals with these conditions; 3) Develop a multi-modal classification model integrating genetics, proteomics, and clinical data relevant to conditions affecting the gut-brain axis. Our findings show that certain disorders elevate AD and PD risk before AD and PD diagnosis including: insulin and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, noninfective gastro-enteritis and colitis, functional intestinal disorders, and bacterial intestinal infections, among others. Polygenic risk scores revealed lower genetic predisposition to AD and PD in individuals with co-occurring disorders in the study categories, underscoring the importance of regulating the gut-brain axis to potentially prevent or delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. The proteomic profile of AD/PD cases was influenced by comorbid endocrine, nutritional, metabolic, and digestive systems conditions. Importantly, we developed multi-modal prediction models integrating clinical, genetic, proteomic and demographic data, the combination of which performs better than any single paradigm approach in disease classification. This work aims to illuminate the intricate interplay between various physiological factors involved in the gut-brain axis and the development of AD and PD, providing a multifactorial systemic understanding that goes beyond traditional approaches.",

    "abstract": "Subcortical brain structures are involved in developmental, psychiatric and neurological disorders. We performed GWAS meta-analyses of intracranial and nine subcortical brain volumes (brainstem, caudate nucleus, putamen, hippocampus, globus pallidus, thalamus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala and, for the first time, the ventral diencephalon) in 74,898 participants of European ancestry. We identified 254 independent loci associated with these brain volumes, explaining up to 35% of phenotypic variance. We observed gene expression in specific neural cell types across differentiation time points, including genes involved in intracellular signalling and brain ageing-related processes. Polygenic scores for brain volumes showed predictive ability when applied to individuals of diverse ancestries. We observed causal genetic effects of brain volumes with Parkinson's disease and ADHD. Findings implicate specific gene expression patterns in brain development and genetic variants in comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders, which could point to a brain substrate and region of action for risk genes implicated in brain diseases.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (DYS) adversely affects the quality of life of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, few studies have focused on the relationship between DYS and sleep and electroencephalography (EEG). Our study aimed to establish the objective physiological indicators assessed by polysomnography (PSG) that are associated with DYS in PD patients.\nWe enrolled 122 patients with PD, divided into two groups: PD with DYS (n\u2009=\u200927) and PD without DYS group (non-DYS, n\u2009=\u200995). The demographics and clinical characteristics and sleep assessment in the two groups were collected. More importantly, overnight six-channel PSG parameters were compared in the two groups. We also compared different bands and brain regions of average power spectral density within each group.\nCompared with the non-DYS group, the DYS group tended to have a significantly higher percentage of nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREM). Gender, levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (min), and the NREM percentage were positively correlated with the occurrence of DYS. After adjusting for gender, disease duration, LEDD, taking amantadine or not, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), NREM%, N3%, and REM (min), the percentage of NREM sleep (p\u2009=\u20090.035), female (p\u2009=\u20090.002), and LEDD (p\u2009=\u20090.005), and REM sleep time (min) (p\u2009=\u20090.012) were still associated with DYS. There was no significant difference in whole-night different bands of average power spectral density between two groups. There was no significant difference in normalized average power spectral density of slow wave activity (SWA) (0.5-2\u2009Hz, 0.5-4\u2009Hz, and 2-4\u2009Hz) of early and late NREM sleep in the DYS group. Dynamic normalized average power spectral density of SWA of low-frequency (0.5-2\u2009Hz) reduction in the frontal region (p\u2009=\u20090.013) was associated with DYS in logistic regression after adjusting for confounding factors.\nPD patients with DYS have substantial sleep structure variations. Higher NREM percentage and less REM percentage were observed in PD patients with DYS. Dynamic normalized average power spectral density of low-frequency (0.5-2\u2009Hz) SWA reduction in the frontal area could be a new electrophysiological marker of DYS in PD.",

    "abstract": "To demonstrate adequate skin adhesion of a new once-daily rotigotine transdermal patch (ROT-TDS) compared to the originator product (reference) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nPharmacokinetic bioequivalence (PK BE) was assessed with the 4 mg/24h patches in healthy adults in a single-/multiple-dose, crossover trial. The trial investigating skin adhesion in PD patients (stable dose \u2265 8 mg/day rotigotine) was performed with the 8 mg/24h patches as a multiple-dose, crossover trial (4 alternating once-daily patch applications). Skin status (seborrhea, sweating) was characterized at screening. Adhesion was assessed 5 minutes after application and 5 minutes before removal of each patch. Systemic safety and skin irritation/sensitization were monitored.\nROT-TDS was bioequivalent to the reference product in the PK BE trial in 48 randomized healthy subjects. In the skin adhesion trial in 43 randomized PD patients, the cumulative mean percentage of adhesion (90% CI) at the end-of-dosing interval was 92.948% (90.156 - 95.740%) for ROT-TDS and 90.471% (87.574 - 93.367%) for the reference. For ROT-TDS, 80.23% of patches were \u2265 90% adhered at the end-of-dosing interval, while this was the case for 67.44% of the reference patches. Safety and skin tolerability of both products were comparable; the most frequent treatment-related adverse event was application-site pruritus for both treatments at comparable extent.\nROT-TDS - with shown BE to the originator reference product - displayed similar safety and local tolerability as the reference product in patients with PD. The results show a trend to improved skin adhesion of the new patch compared to the reference in the target population.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a typical symptom of both neurodegenerative and certain other diseases. In connection with these different pathologies, the etiology and neurological and metabolic changes associated with cognitive impairment must differ. Until these characteristics and differences are understood in greater detail, pharmacological treatment of the different forms of cognitive impairment remains suboptimal. Neurotransmitter receptors, including neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), dopamine receptors, and glutamine receptors, play key roles in the functions and metabolisms of the brain. Among these, the role of nAChRs in the development of cognitive impairment has attracted more and more attention. The present review summarizes what is presently known concerning the structure, distribution, metabolism, and function of nAChRs, as well as their involvement in major cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, schizophrenia, and diabetes mellitus. As will be discussed, the relevant scientific literature reveals clearly that the \u03b14\u03b22 and \u03b17 nAChR subtypes and/or subunits of the receptors play major roles in maintaining cognitive function and in neuroprotection of the brain. Accordingly, focusing on these as targets of drug therapy can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of cognitive disorders such as AD and schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "In addition to their motor symptoms, almost all Parkinson's disease patients report non-motor symptoms (NMS) and, in the later course of the disease, non-motor fluctuations as well. These NMS encompass e.g. neuropsychiatric, gastrointestinal, urogenital, cardiovascular symptoms and pain. For a long time, these symptoms received no or at best very little attention, but there is a growing trend towards their recognition and treatment. Despite this progress, significant gaps remain, particularly due to the sometimes-limited expertise among neurologists regarding these symptoms. The clinical need to consequently treat these NMS raises the question of whether Movement Disorder specialists should and can address them sufficiently or if additional consultant physicians have to be enrolled. Therefore, our objective is to establish benchmarking criteria to outline a potential way forward. Ideally, Movement Disorder specialists should take on greater responsibility when treating non-motor PD symptoms, integrating diagnostic and therapeutic pathways from other medical disciplines where feasible.",

    "abstract": "Selective vulnerability offers a conceptual framework for understanding neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, where specific neuronal types are selectively affected and adjacent ones are spared. However, the applicability of this framework to neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those characterized by atypical social behaviors, such as autism spectrum disorder, remains uncertain. Here we show that an embryonic disturbance, known to induce social dysfunction in male mice, preferentially impaired the gene expression crucial for neural functions in parvocellular oxytocin (OT) neurons-a subtype linked to social rewards-while neighboring cell types experienced a lesser impact. Chemogenetic stimulation of OT neurons at the neonatal stage ameliorated social deficits in early adulthood, concurrent with cell-type-specific sustained recovery of pivotal gene expression within parvocellular OT neurons. Collectively, our data shed light on the transcriptomic selective vulnerability within the hypothalamic social behavioral center and provide a potential therapeutic target through specific neonatal neurostimulation.",

The chapter covers neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as several psychiatric disorders, namely schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and major depressive disorder. This chapter also addresses other types of neurological dysfunctions, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. EVs can cross the blood brain barrier, and thus brain EVs may be detected in more accessible peripheral tissue, such as circulating blood. Alterations in EV composition and contents can therefore impart valuable clues into the molecular etiology of these disorders, and serve biomarkers regarding disease prevalence, progression and treatment. EVs can also be used to carry drugs and biomolecules into brain tissue, considered as a promising drug delivery agent for neurological diseases. Therefore, although this area of research is still in its early development, it offers great potential in further elucidating and in treating neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Cells, pathogens, and other systems release extracellular vesicles (EVs). The particles promote intercellular communication and contain proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA. Initially considered to be cellular waste in the twentieth century, EVs were becoming recognized for their function in biological communication and control. EVs are divided into many subtypes: exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. Exosomes form in the late endosome/multivesicular body and are released when the compartments fuse with the plasma membrane. Microvesicles are generated by direct budding of the plasma membrane, whereas apoptotic bodies are formed after cellular apoptosis. The new guideline for EVs that describes alternate nomenclature for EVs. The particles modulate the immune response by affecting both innate and adaptive immunity, and their specific the structure allows them to be used as biomarkers to diagnose a variety of diseases. EVs have a wide range of applications, for example, delivery systems for medications and genetic therapies because of their ability to convey specific cellular material. In anti-tumor therapy, EVs deliver therapeutic chemicals to tumor cells. The EVs promote transplant compatibility and reduce organ rejection. Host-parasite interactions, therapeutic and diagnostic for cancer, cardiovascular disease, cardiac tissue regeneration, and the treatment of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The study of EVs keeps on expanding, revealing new functions and beneficial options.

    "abstract": "Motor subtypes in Parkinson's Disease (PD) are unstable over time, limiting mechanistic insights and biomarker discovery. We focused on Rest Tremor (RT) as a symptom to test for phenotype stability and link it to specific circuits and disease mechanisms. Using the PPMI cohort data over 5\u00a0years we found that RT is more stable than classical Tremor-Dominant definitions, a stability also seen for RT response to therapy. At time of diagnosis, the population of therapy-resistant RT patients was enriched with a brain-first PD profile as predicted by a-Synuclein origin site and connectome (SOC) model. Resistant-RT patients have lower gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms, lower prevalence of probable REM-Sleep behaviour disorder, and higher dopaminergic asymmetry compared to therapy-responsive or no tremor patients. Treating RT as a distinct phenomenon revealed a relative phenotypic stability with treatment response being linked to different patterns of disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and osteoporosis are prevalent chronic conditions that impact a significant proportion of the aging population. Observational and longitudinal studies consistently demonstrate that individuals with PD face an elevated risk of osteoporosis and reduced bone mineral density compared to control groups. However, there is currently no experimental evidence demonstrating the impact of dopaminergic neuron degeneration on bone metabolism. In the present study, we used a male rat model of PD induced by unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the left medial forebrain bundle (MFB) to evaluate the effect of dopaminergic neuron lesion on certain parameters of bone metabolism. To confirm the dopaminergic neuron lesion, cylinder and Rotarod tests were applied to rats injected with 6-OHDA or vehicle. Osteocyte density and viability were determined through histology and TUNEL assay. Western Blot and immunohistochemistry analysis were performed to investigate whether dopaminergic degeneration influences the expression of some apoptotic markers (Caspase 3 and Cytochrome C) and some osteogenic markers (ALP, OCN, and RUNX2). Our findings show that the dopaminergic lesion resulting from the injection of 6-OHDA was successfully confirmed through behavioral tests. Furthermore, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons induced by 6-OHDA leads to apoptosis of osteocytes associated with a significant reduction in the tissue expression of the studied osteogenic markers. Thus, our study provides evidence that 6-OHDA-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons leads to osteocyte apoptosis, which may contribute to the development of some signs of osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "Successful execution of normal activities in various populations warrants the performance of dual tasks (DTs). DTs involve motor and cognitive tasking with the involvement of various brain areas. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been used for regulating the excitability of brain cortical regions. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the available scientific evidence on the effects of tDCS combined with concurrent DT walking on mobility, gait and cognition in older adults (OAs) with and without Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe PubMed, PEDro, Cochrane Library, Embase and Web databases of Science were searched for relevant articles published from their beginning until date. Randomized controlled trials were retrieved, and their methodological quality and risk of bias were evaluated using the PEDro scale and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool respectively. Qualitative and quantitative synthesis were used to analyze the data.\nFive studies were included in the review. The results revealed that in individuals with PD, active tDCS with concurrent DT walking has more potential to significantly improve DT cost to gait speed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and the proportion of correct responses during DT time up and go test (TUG)\nThe effects of tDCS combined with concurrent DT walking or training on cognitive, gait and mobility outcomes in OAs with or without PD can be better explained by the DTW training itself. However, tDCS could produce some specific effects in particular outcomes and scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Integrating domain knowledge into deep learning models can improve their effectiveness and increase explainability. This study aims to enhance the classification performance of electrocardiograms (ECGs) by customizing specific guided mechanisms based on the characteristics of different cardiac abnormalities.\nTwo novel guided attention mechanisms, Guided Spatial Attention (GSA) and CAM-based spatial guided attention mechanism (CGAM), were introduced. Different attention guidance labels were created based on clinical knowledge for four ECG abnormality classification tasks: ST change detection, premature contraction identification, Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) classification, and atrial fibrillation (AF) detection. The models were trained and evaluated separately for each classification task. Model explainability was quantified using Shapley values.\nGSA improved the F1 score of the model by 5.74%, 5%, 8.96%, and 3.91% for ST change detection, premature contraction identification, WPW classification, and AF detection, respectively. Similarly, CGAM exhibited improvements of 3.89%, 5.40%, 8.21%, and 1.80% for the respective tasks. The combined use of GSA and CGAM resulted in even higher improvements of 6.26%, 5.58%, 8.85%, and 4.03%, respectively. Moreover, when all four tasks were conducted simultaneously, a notable overall performance boost was achieved, demonstrating the broad adaptability of the proposed model. The quantified Shapley values demonstrated the effectiveness of the guided attention mechanisms in enhancing the model's explainability.\nThe guided attention mechanisms, utilizing domain knowledge, effectively directed the model's attention, leading to improved classification performance and explainability. These findings have significant implications in facilitating accurate automated ECG classification.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to target messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and promoting their degradation or blocking their translation. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. There is increasing evidence to suggest that miRNAs play a role in the pathogenesis of PD. Studies have identified several miRNAs that are dysregulated in the brains of PD patients, and animal models of the disease. MiRNA expression dysregulation contributes to the onset and progression of PD by modulating neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and protein aggregation genes. Moreover, miRNAs have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for PD. This review elucidates the changes in miRNA expression profiles associated with PD, emphasising their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and detailing specific miRNAs implicated in PD and their downstream targets.

    "abstract": "Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA). Mammalian DGK comprise ten isozymes (\u03b1-\u03ba) that regulate a wide variety of physiological and pathological events. Recently, we revealed that DGK isozymes use saturated fatty acid (SFA)/monosaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-containing and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6)-containing DG species, but not phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover-derived 18:0/20:4-DG. For example, DGK\u03b4, which is involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, preferentially uses SFA/MUFA-containing DG species, such as 16:0/16:0- and 16:0/18:1-DG species, in high glucose-stimulated skeletal muscle cells. Moreover, DGK\u03b4, which destabilizes the serotonin transporter (SERT) and regulates the serotonergic system in the brain, primarily generates 18:0/22:6-PA. Furthermore, 16:0/16:0-PA is produced by DGK\u03b6 in Neuro-2a cells during neuronal differentiation. We searched for SFA/MUFA-PA- and 18:0/22:6-PA-selective binding proteins (candidate downstream targets of DGK\u03b4) and found that SFA/MUFA-PA binds to and activates the creatine kinase muscle type, an energy-metabolizing enzyme, and that 18:0/22:6-PA interacts with and activates Praja-1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase acting on SERT, and synaptojanin-1, a key player in the synaptic vesicle cycle. Next, we searched for SFA/MUFA-DG-generating enzymes upstream of DGK\u03b4. We found that sphingomyelin synthase (SMS)1, SMS2, and SMS-related protein (SMSr) commonly act as phosphatidylcholine (PC)-phospholipase C (PLC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-PLC, generating SFA/MUFA-DG species, in addition to SMS and ceramide phosphoethanolamine synthase. Moreover, the orphan phosphatase PHOSPHO1 showed PC- and PE-PLC activities that produced SFA/MUFA-DG. Although PC- and PE-PLC activities were first described 70-35 years ago, their proteins and genes were not identified for a long time. We found that DGK\u03b4 interacts with SMSr and PHOSPHO1, and that DGK\u03b6 binds to SMS1 and SMSr. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that there are previously unrecognized signal transduction pathways that include DGK isozymes and generate and utilize SFA/MUFA-DG/PA or 18:0/22:6-DG/PA but not PI-turnover-derived 18:0/20:4-DG/PA.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral cytokine levels may affect specific brain volumes. Few studies have examined this possible relationship.\nIn a case-control study, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) voxel-based morphological analysis techniques to examine the relationship between gray matter volume changes and cognitive, motor and emotional dysfunction as well as between gray matter volume changes and peripheral blood cytokine levels.\nA total of 134 subjects, comprising 66 PD patients and 68 healthy controls, were recruited. Peripheral venous blood was collected to measure the concentrations of 12 cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1. All the subjects also underwent MRI, where 3D-T1-weighted MR images were used for the analysis. In addition, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores were assessed in PD patients. Statistical parameter mapping 12 software was used for the statistical analysis of the images.\nCompared with control patients, PD patients presented decreased gray matter volume (GMV) in the bilateral frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, insula, and right cerebellar lobule VIII. Regional GMV in the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and cerebellum was correlated with MoCA, MMSE, UPDRS, HAMA, and HAMD scores in PDs. In addition, the regional GMV in PDs was correlated with the concentrations of cytokines, including IL-4, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1. The IL-6 concentration was negatively correlated with the UPDRS-IV score.\nPD patients exhibit gray matter atrophy in a wide range of brain regions, which are symmetrically distributed and mainly concentrated in the frontal and temporal lobes, and these changes may be linked to motor disorders and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Cytokine concentrations in peripheral blood are correlated with regional gray matter volume in PDs, and the IL-6 level affects gray matter volume in the left precentral gyrus and the manifestation of motor complications.",

    "abstract": "PINK1 and Parkin mutations lead to the early onset of Parkinson's disease. PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of ubiquitin (Ub), ubiquitin-like protein (NEDD8), and ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain of Parkin activate autoinhibited Parkin E3 ligase. The mechanism of various phospho-Ubls' specificity and conformational changes leading to Parkin activation remain elusive. Herein, we show that compared to Ub, NEDD8 is a more robust binder and activator of Parkin. Structures and biophysical/biochemical data reveal specific recognition and underlying mechanisms of pUb/pNEDD8 and pUbl domain binding to the RING1 and RING0 domains, respectively. Also, pUb/pNEDD8 binding in the RING1 pocket promotes allosteric conformational changes in Parkin's catalytic domain (RING2), leading to Parkin activation. Furthermore, Parkinson's disease mutation K211N in the RING0 domain was believed to perturb Parkin activation due to loss of pUb binding. However, our data reveal allosteric conformational changes due to N211 that lock RING2 with RING0 to inhibit Parkin activity without disrupting pNEDD8/pUb binding.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety and depression are common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) but remain under-recognized and under-treated.\nTo evaluate functional outcomes associated with baseline anxiety or depression and effects related to the initiation of new psychiatric treatment.\nWe analyzed 7\u2009years of data from patients with de novo PD enrolled in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Longitudinal regression models evaluated the association between baseline anxiety and depression with Schwab and England (SE) and MDS-UPDRS total scores over time. Cox proportional hazard models assessed effects of baseline anxiety and depression on time to initiation of dopaminergic therapy. Piecewise linear regression models examined the association of treatment initiation for anxiety and depression with SE and MDS-UPDRS.\n490 participants with baseline depression and anxiety data were included. Anxiety and depression were associated with lower SE (anxiety: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-1.31, P\u2009=\u20090.038, depression: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-1.96, P\u2009=\u20090.012, co-morbid: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-2.70, P\u2009=\u20090.003) and higher MDS-UPDRS scores (anxiety: \u03b2\u2009=\u20095.37, P\u2009<\u20090.001, depression: \u03b2\u2009=\u20099.17, P\u2009<\u20090.001, co-morbid: \u03b2\u2009=\u200910.50, P\u2009<\u20090.001) longitudinally. Anxiety was associated with faster time to dopamine replacement therapy initiation (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03-1.66, P\u2009=\u20090.03). 16 participants with anxiety initiated treatment for anxiety, which was associated with subsequent lower levodopa daily dose (slope change\u2009=\u2009-218.49, P\u2009=\u20090.018). 10 participants with depression initiated treatment of depression, which was associated with reduced MDS-UPDRS total scores (slope change\u2009=\u2009-8.3, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and higher SE scores (slope change\u2009=\u20095.99, P\u2009=\u20090.004).\nAnxiety and depression at PD onset are associated with multiple negative longitudinal trajectories. However, preliminary findings suggest that anxiety and depression treatment may be linked with improved motor and non-motor outcomes.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that rare cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology may cause corticobasal or posterior cortical atrophy syndromes, and that cases with advanced AD may develop parkinsonism.

The patient improved, but only mildly, to standard treatment for PD motor symptoms. The neuropathological examination identified AD changes, and no evidence to support a concomitant diagnosis of PD.\nThe absence of alpha-synucleinopathy, coupled with the patient's dementia history and AD changes in neuropathological examination, indicated the diagnosis of AD and no supplementary explanation. Neuronal loss with neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in the brainstem, substantia nigra, and locus coeruleus likely contributed to Parkinsonism features.",

    "abstract": "Beta band oscillations in the sensorimotor cortex and subcortical structures, such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal pallidum (GPi), are closely linked to motor control. Recent research suggests that low-beta (14.5-23.5\u00a0Hz) and high-beta (23.5-35\u00a0Hz) cortico-STN coherence arise through distinct networks, possibly reflecting indirect and hyperdirect pathways. In this study, we sought to probe whether low- and high-beta coherence also exhibit different functional roles in facilitating and inhibiting movement. Twenty patients with Parkinson's disease who had deep brain stimulation electrodes implanted in either STN or GPi performed a classical go/nogo task while undergoing simultaneous magnetoencephalography and local field potentials recordings. Subjects' expectations were manipulated by presenting go- and nogo-trials with varying probabilities. We identified a lateral source in the sensorimotor cortex for low-beta coherence, as well as a medial source near the supplementary motor area for high-beta coherence. Task-related coherence time courses for these two sources revealed that low-beta coherence was more strongly implicated than high-beta coherence in the performance of go-trials. Accordingly, average pre-stimulus low-beta but not high-beta coherence or spectral power correlated with overall reaction time across subjects. High-beta coherence during unexpected nogo-trials was higher compared to expected nogo-trials at a relatively long latency of 3\u00a0s after stimulus presentation. Neither low- nor high-beta coherence showed a significant correlation with patients' symptom severity at baseline assessment. While low-beta cortico-subcortical coherence appears to be related to motor output, the role of high-beta coherence requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Previous research revealed differences in cerebellar white matter integrity by disease stages, indicating a compensatory role in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the temporal evolution of cerebellar white matter microstructure in patients with PD (PwPD) remains unclear.\nTo unravel temporal evolution of cerebellar white matter and its dopaminergic correlates in PD.\nWe recruited 124 PwPD from the PPMI study. The participants were divided into two subsets: Subset 1 (n\u00a0=\u00a041) had three MRI scans (baseline, 2\u00a0years, and 4\u00a0years), and Subset 2 (n\u00a0=\u00a0106) had at least two MRI scans at baseline, 1\u00a0year, and/or 2\u00a0years. Free water-corrected diffusion metrics were used to measure the microstructural integrity in cerebellar peduncles (CP), the main white matter tracts connecting to and from the cerebellum. The ACAPULCO processing pipeline was used to assess cerebellar lobules volumes. Linear mixed-effect models were used to study longitudinal changes. We also examined the relationships between microstructural integrity in CP, striatal dopamine transporter specific binding ratio (SBR), and clinical symptoms.\nMicrostructural changes in CP showed a non-linear pattern in PwPD. Free water-corrected fractional anisotropy (FAt) increased in the first two years but declined from 2 to 4\u00a0years, while free water-corrected mean diffusivity exhibited the opposite trend. The initial increased FAt in CP correlated with cerebellar regional volume atrophy, striatal dopaminergic SBR decline, and worsening clinical symptoms, but this correlation varied across disease stages.\nOur findings suggest a non-linear evolution of microstructural integrity in CP throughout the course of PD, indicating the adaptive structural reorganization of the cerebellum simultaneously with progressive striatal dopaminergic degeneration in PD.",

Free water-corrected fractional anisotropy (FAt) increased in the first two years but declined from 2 to 4\u00a0years, while free water-corrected mean diffusivity exhibited the opposite trend.

    "abstract": "REM Sleep Behavioral Disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia marked by the maintenance of muscle tone during REM sleep. Evidence has placed RBD as one of the possible prodromal stages of Parkinson's Disease (PD), but data on the proportion of people with PD who have had symptoms of RBD are limited. This study aimed to investigate the history of symptoms compatible with RBD in a population with PD. The sample was composed by 73 patients with clinically diagnosed PD being followed up at a reference outpatient setting, compared to 73 age- and sex-matched individuals with no PD. The evaluation of symptoms compatible with RBD was performed using the Brazilian version of the RBD Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ). The prevalence of symptoms compatible with RBD was 65\u00a0% for PD and 10.09\u00a0% for controls. The RBDSQ score was significantly higher in the PD group (6.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.35) in comparison to the control group (2.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23). The odds ratio for presenting previous RBD-compatible symptoms was 12.09 in favor of positive PD cases. PD diagnosis has the following diagnostic properties in relation to presenting RBD symptoms: sensitivity of 0.65, specificity of 0.86, positive predictive value of 0.82 and negative predictive value of 0.71. In conclusion, the proportion of PD patients showing RBD symptoms is high, corroborating the expected neuroprogression of the disease on a case-control design comprising outpatient PD cases. Clinical practitioners should include evaluations of RBD-compatible symptoms during the PD assessment and, if positive, forward to a sleep specialist.",

    "abstract": "More than 60% of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) cases are of uncertain variants.\nThe aim was to elucidate novel genetic contribution to PKD.\nA total of 476 probands with uncertain genetic causes were enrolled for whole-exome sequencing. A method of case-control analysis was applied to identify the candidate genes. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording was applied to verify the electrophysiological impact of the identified variants. A mouse model with cerebellar heterozygous knockout of the candidate gene was developed via adeno-associated virus injection, and dystonia-like phenotype inducement and rotarod tests were performed. In vivo multiunit electrical recording was applied to investigate the change in neural excitability in knockout mice.\nHeterozygous variants of potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J member 10 (KCNJ10) clustered in PKD patients were compared with those in the control groups. Fifteen variants were detected in 16 of 522 probands (frequency\u2009=\u20093.07%). Patients with KCNJ10 variants tended to have a milder manifestation compared to those with PRRT2 (proline-rich transmembrane protein 2) variants. KCNJ10 variants partially altered the transmembrane location of inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 (Kir4.1). The Kcnj10 expression is consistent with the natural course of PKD. Variants resulted in different degrees of reduction in cell Kir4.1 currents, and mice with heterozygous conditional knockout of Kcnj10 in the cerebellum presented dystonic posture, together with poor motor coordination and motor learning ability in rotarod tests. The firing rate of deep cerebellar nuclei was significantly elevated in Kcnj10-cKO mice.\nWe identified heterozygous variants of KCNJ10 in PKD. Impaired function of Kir4.1 might lead to abnormal neuronal excitability, which attributed to PKD. \u00a9 2024 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

Patients with KCNJ10 variants tended to have a milder manifestation compared to those with PRRT2 (proline-rich transmembrane protein 2) variants. KCNJ10 variants partially altered the transmembrane location of inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 (Kir4.1). The Kcnj10 expression is consistent with the natural course of PKD. Variants resulted in different degrees of reduction in cell Kir4.1 currents, and mice with heterozygous conditional knockout of Kcnj10 in the cerebellum presented dystonic posture, together with poor motor coordination and motor learning ability in rotarod tests. The firing rate of deep cerebellar nuclei was significantly elevated in Kcnj10-cKO mice.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a spectrum of conditions characterized by the gradual deterioration of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system. While their origins are multifaceted, emerging data underscore the pivotal role of impaired mitochondrial functions and endolysosomal homeostasis to the onset and progression of pathology. This article explores whether mitochondrial dysfunctions act as causal factors or are intricately linked to the decline in endolysosomal function. As research delves deeper into the genetics of neurodegenerative diseases, an increasing number of risk loci and genes associated with the regulation of endolysosomal and autophagy functions are being identified, arguing for a downstream impact on mitochondrial health. Our hypothesis centers on the notion that disturbances in endolysosomal processes may propagate to other organelles, including mitochondria, through disrupted inter-organellar communication. We discuss these views in the context of major neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and their relevance to potential therapeutic avenues.",

    "abstract": "Mitophagy neutralizes mitochondrial damage, thereby preventing cellular dysfunction and apoptosis. Defects in mitophagy have been strongly implicated in age-related\u00a0neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. While mitophagy decreases throughout the lifespan of short-lived model organisms, it remains unknown whether such a decline occurs in the aging mammalian brain-a question of fundamental importance for understanding cell type- and region-specific susceptibility to neurodegeneration. Here, we define the longitudinal dynamics of basal mitophagy and macroautophagy across neuronal and non-neuronal cell types within the intact aging mouse brain in vivo. Quantitative profiling of reporter mouse cohorts from young to geriatric ages reveals cell- and tissue-specific alterations in mitophagy and macroautophagy between distinct subregions and cell populations, including dopaminergic neurons, cerebellar Purkinje cells, astrocytes, microglia and interneurons. We also find that healthy aging is hallmarked by the dynamic accumulation of differentially acidified lysosomes in several neural cell subsets. Our findings argue against any widespread age-related decline in mitophagic activity, instead demonstrating dynamic fluctuations in mitophagy across the aging trajectory, with\u00a0strong implications for ongoing theragnostic development.",

    "abstract": "Exogenous gaseous formaldehyde (FA) is recognized as a significant indoor air pollutant due to its chemical reactivity and documented mutagenic and carcinogenic properties, particularly in its capacity to damage DNA and impact human health. Despite increasing attention on the adverse effects of exogenous FA on human health, the potential detrimental effects of endogenous FA in the brain have been largely neglected in current research. Endogenous FA have been observed to accumulate in the aging brain due to dysregulation in the expression and activity of enzymes involved in FA metabolism. Surprisingly, excessive FA have been implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and brain cancers. Notably, FA has the ability to not only initiate\u00a0DNA double strand breaks but also induce the formation of crosslinks of DNA-DNA, DNA-RNA, and DNA-protein, which further exacerbate the progression of these brain diseases. However, recent research has identified that FA-resistant gene exonuclease-1 (EXO1) and FA scavengers can potentially mitigate FA toxicity, offering a promising strategy for mitigating or repairing FA-induced DNA damage. The present review offers novel insights into the impact of FA metabolism on brain ageing and the contribution of FA-damaged DNA to the progression of neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota changes and brain-gut-axis (BGA) dysregulation are common in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Probiotics and prebiotics are emerging as a potential therapeutic approach for PD patients. The aim of this paper was to assess the neurological and gastroenterological effects in PD patients with constipation after the administration of a synbiotic product, with a focus on behavioral and cognitive symptoms. We enrolled patients with stable PD who met diagnostic criteria for functional constipation and/or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation according to Rome IV Criteria. Patients received a synbiotic treatment (Enterolactis Duo, containing the probiotic strain Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DG and the prebiotic fiber inulin) for 12\u00a0weeks. A neurological and a gastroenterological evaluation were collected before and after the treatment. In addition, 16S rRNA gene profiling and short chain fatty acid quantification were performed to characterize the microbial ecosystem of fecal samples collected before (n\u2009=\u200922) and after (n\u2009=\u20099) the synbiotic administration. 30 patients were consecutively enrolled. After treatment, patients performed better in MDS-UPDRS part 1 (p\u2009=\u20090.000), SCOPA-AUT (p\u2009=\u20090.001), TAS-20 (p\u2009=\u20090.014), HAM-D (p\u2009=\u20090.026), DIFt (p\u2009=\u20090.003), PAS-A (p\u2009=\u20090.048). Gastroenterological evaluations showed improvements in PAC-SYM score (p\u2009<\u20090.001), number of complete bowel movement (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and BSFS (p\u2009<\u20090.001). After the synbiotic administration, we observed a significant increase in the abundance of the order Oscillospirales, as well as the Oscillospiraceae family and the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii within this order in fecal samples. Synbiotic treatment demonstrates potential efficacy in ameliorating non-motor features in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Although many researchers of Parkinson's disease (PD) have shifted their focus from the central nervous system (CNS) to the peripheral blood, a significant knowledge gap remains between PD severity and the peripheral immune response. In the current study, we aimed to map the peripheral immunity atlas in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PD patients and healthy controls using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Our study employed scRNA-seq analysis to map the peripheral immunity atlas in PD by profiling PBMCs from PD-Early, PD-Late patients and matched controls. By enlarging the blood sample size, we validated the roles of NK cells in numerous immune-related biological processes. We also detected the infiltration of NK cells into the cerebral motor cortex as the disease progressed, using human brain sections, and elucidated the communication between the periphery and CNS and its implications for PD. As a result, cell subpopulation atlases in PBMCs from PD patients and healthy controls along with differentially expressed genes in NK cells were identified by scRNA-seq analysis, representing 6 major immune cell subsets among which NK cells declined in the progression of PD. We further validated NK cell reduction in increasing samples and found that they participated in numerous immune-related biological processes and infiltration into the cerebral motor cortex as the disease proceeded, evidencingd the close communication between the peripheral immune response and CNS. Strikingly, XCL2 positively correlated with PD severity, with good predictive performance of PD and specific expression in subclusters C2 and C5 of NK cells. All these findings delineated the critical role of peripheral immune response mediated by NK cells in the pathogenesis of PD. NK cell-specific XCL2 could be used as a diagnostic marker for treating PD. The indispensable function of NK cells and NK cell-specific molecular biomarkers highlighted the implication of the peripheral immune response in PD progression.

    "abstract": "Frailty is recognized as an important predictor of neurointerventional outcomes. MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy is a treatment option for patients with refractory essential tremor (ET) and tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (TdPD). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether frailer MRgFUS thalamotomy patients had worse tremor outcomes or more complications.\nThe authors performed a cohort analysis of patients treated with MRgFUS between 2020 and 2023. Inclusion criteria were unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy for ET or TdPD with available follow-up data (minimum 3-month follow-up). Frailty was assessed using the 11-item modified frailty index (mFI-11), which includes 11 medical comorbidities. Tremor outcomes were assessed using the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor Part B. Complications assessed included disturbances of sensation, speech and swallowing, balance and gait, and strength.\nIn total, 169 eligible patients were identified, including 135 (79.9%) ET and 34 (20.1%) TdPD patients. Frailty did not result in significant differences in tremor outcomes in the combined (p = 0.833), ET (p = 0.902), or TdPD (p = 0.501) cohort, or in any adverse events at the last follow-up (all p > 0.05). The combined mean follow-up was 10.3 \u00b1 5.8 months (range 3-24 months), with cohort-specific mean follow-ups of 10.8 \u00b1 6.0 months for ET and 8.6 \u00b1 4.6 months for TdPD. Between the ET and TdPD cohorts, no significant differences existed in age, sex, handedness, side treated, skull density ratio, number of sonications, peak and average temperatures, energy delivered, BMI, or American Society of Anesthesiologists classification. For medical comorbidities, only hypertension was significantly different (65.9% ET, 47.1% TdPD; p = 0.043). The ET patients were significantly frailer overall, with 20.7% ET and 35.3% TdPD patients considered robust (mFI-11 score of 0), 14.8% ET and 32.4% TdPD patients prefrail (mFI-11 score of 1), 25.9% ET and 8.8% TdPD patients frail (mFI-11 score of 2), and 38.5% ET and 23.5% TdPD patients severely frail (mFI-11 score \u2265 3) (p = 0.007).\nIncreasing frailty is not associated with worse outcomes, suggesting that MRgFUS may be appropriate even for frailer patients. ET patients are frailer than TdPD patients selected for MRgFUS.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are not fully understood, which hinders the development of effective therapies. Research indicates that lower levels of biochemical indicators like bilirubin, vitamin D, and cholesterol may elevate the risk of PD. However, clinical studies on abnormal levels of biochemical indicators in PD patients' circulation are inconsistent, leading to ongoing debate about their association with PD. Here, we investigate the genetic correlation between 40 biochemical indicators and PD using a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to uncover potential causal relationships. Data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were utilized, with genetic variations from specific lineages serving as instrumental variables (IVs). The methodology followed the STROBE-MR checklist and adhered to the three principal assumptions of MR. Statistical analyses employed methods including inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode. Biochemical indicators including albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) showed significant associations with PD risk. Elevated levels of albumin (OR\u2009=\u20091.246, 95% CI 1.006-1.542, P\u2009=\u20090.043) and SHBG (OR\u2009=\u20091.239, 95% CI 1.065-1.439, P\u2009=\u20090.005) were linked to higher PD risk. Conversely, increased CRP levels (OR\u2009=\u20090.663, 95% CI 0.517-0.851; P\u2009=\u20090.001) could potentially lower PD risk. The robustness of the results was confirmed through various MR analysis techniques, including assessments of directional pleiotropy and heterogeneity using MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO methods. This study systematically reveals, for the first time at the genetic level, the relationship between 40 biochemical indicators and PD risk. Our research verifies the role of inflammation in PD and provides new genetic evidence, further advancing the understanding of PD pathogenesis. The study shows a positive correlation between albumin and SHBG with PD risk and a negative correlation between CRP and PD risk. This study identifies for the first time that SHBG may be involved in the onset of PD and potentially worsen disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative movement disorder. Most PD patients are looked after by caregivers who are close to them regardless of their relationship. Caregivers may experience a notable impact on their mental health as they dedicate a significant amount of time to the patient while observing the progression of the disease.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the level of burden, depression, anxiety, and stress among caregivers of PD patients.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional analysis between July and September 2023 among caregivers of PD patients following in the Movement Disorders Clinic at King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and through the Saudi Parkinson's Society. The data collection was done anonymously through an electronic self-administered questionnaire. Caregiver burden was assessed by using the validated Arabic version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) scale, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) was used to assess the presence and level of anxiety and depression.\nThere were 118 caregivers (53.39% female, 33.9% aged between 35- 45 years, and 73.73% were sons/daughters) caring for 118 patients (57.63%, male, 38.98% aged between 66- 76). The ZBI score was highest among sibling caregivers. Moreover, burden scores were higher among those who provided care more frequently than others.\nOur study revealed that PD caregivers face a high risk of care burden, especially those who are siblings and spend longer periods in patient care. Additionally, female caregivers reported higher rates of depression, anxiety, and stress.\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a serious condition that affects movement, and most PD patients are cared for by someone close to them, such as a family member. This caregiving can significantly impact the mental health of the caregiver, who often spends a lot of time caring for the patient and witnessing the disease\u2019s progression. We studied caregivers of PD patients at the Movement Disorders Clinic at King Khalid University Hospital and through the Saudi Parkinson\u2019s Society from July to September 2023. Caregivers completed an anonymous electronic questionnaire, and we measured caregiver burden using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and assessed anxiety and depression using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). Our study included 118 caregivers (53.39% female, most aged 35\u2013 45 years, and 73.73% were sons or daughters) caring for 118 PD patients (57.63% male, most aged 66\u2013 76 years). Caregivers who were siblings or cared for the patient daily had higher burden scores, and female caregivers had higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress compared to males. Our study revealed that PD caregivers face a high risk of care burden, especially those who are siblings and spend longer periods in patient care, and that female caregivers exhibited an elevated risk of experiencing depression, anxiety, or stress.",

    "abstract": "Speech impairments are common with Parkinson's disease (reported prevalence 68%), increasing conversational demands, reliance on family and social withdrawal.\nThe PD COMM trial compared the clinical and cost-effectiveness of two speech and language therapy approaches: Lee Silverman Voice Treatment LOUD and National Health Service speech and language therapy for the treatment of speech or voice problems in people with Parkinson's disease to no speech and language therapy (control) and against each other.\nPD COMM is a phase III, multicentre, three-arm, unblinded, randomised controlled trial. Participants were randomised in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to control, National Health Service speech and language therapy or Lee Silverman Voice Treatment LOUD via a central computer-generated programme, using a minimisation procedure with a random element, to ensure allocation concealment. Mixed-methods process and health economic evaluations were conducted.\nUnited Kingdom outpatient and home settings.\nPeople with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, with self-reported or carer-reported speech or voice problems. We excluded people with dementia, laryngeal pathology and those within 24 months of previous speech and language therapy.\nThe Lee Silverman Voice Treatment LOUD intervention included maximum effort drills and high-effort speech production tasks delivered over four 50-minute therapist-led personalised sessions per week, for 4 weeks with prescribed daily home practice. National Health Service speech and language therapy content and dosage reflected local non-Lee Silverman Voice Treatment speech and language therapy practices, usually 1 hour, once weekly, for 6 weeks. Trained, experienced speech and language therapists or assistants provided interventions. The control was no speech and language therapy until the trial was completed.\nPrimary outcome: Voice Handicap Index total score at 3 months. Secondary outcomes: Voice Handicap Index subscales, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39; Questionnaire on Acquired Speech Disorders; EuroQol-5D-5L; ICEpop Capabilities Measure for Older Adults; Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire - Carers; resource utilisation; and adverse events. Assessments were completed pre-randomisation and at 3, 6 and 12 months post randomisation.\nThree hundred and eighty-eight participants were randomised to Lee Silverman Voice Treatment LOUD (\nThe number of participants recruited to the trial did not meet the pre-specified power.\nPeople that had access to Lee Silverman Voice Treatment LOUD described a significantly greater reduction in the impact of their Parkinson's disease-related speech problems 3 months after randomisation compared to people that had no speech and language therapy. There was no evidence of a difference between National Health Service speech and language therapy and those that received no speech and language therapy. Lee Silverman Voice Treatment LOUD resulted in a significantly lower impact of voice problems compared to National Health Service speech and language therapy 3 months after randomisation which was still present after 12 months; however, Lee Silverman Voice Treatment LOUD was not found to be cost-effective.\nImplementing Lee Silverman Voice Treatment LOUD in the National Health Service and identifying alternatives to Lee Silverman Voice Treatment LOUD for those who cannot tolerate it. Investigation of less costly alternative options for Lee Silverman Voice Treatment delivery require investigation, with economic evaluation using a preference-based outcome measure that captures improvement in communication.\nThis study is registered as ISRCTN12421382.\nThis award was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (NIHR award ref: 10/135/02) and is published in full in \nMost people with Parkinson\u2019s disease develop difficulties with their speech and voice. Communicating becomes difficult. This affects their relationships, work, social life and how they feel about themselves. Our PD COMM trial compared two types of speech and language therapy to find out if they helped the speech and voice problems people with Parkinson\u2019s have. We measured changes in the way their voice and speech problems affected their lives and how much therapy cost the National Health Service and families. Everyone taking part had speech or voice problems because of their Parkinson\u2019s disease. People could not take part if they had dementia, evidence of laryngeal pathology or previous laryngeal surgery or received speech and therapy for Parkinson\u2019s disease in the last 2 years. People who agreed to take part joined one of three groups, which were alike except for the therapy they received. A computer decided which group they joined by chance. National Health Service speech and language therapy Lee Silverman Voice Treatment LOUD No speech and language therapy for 12 months The 388 people who took part came from 41 outpatient clinics in Scotland, England and Wales. Most were older men. The people that received Lee Silverman Voice Treatment LOUD felt better about their speech and voice after 3 months compared to people in the other groups. A year later, they still felt better about it. People that received National Health Service therapy had no benefit compared to people with no access to therapy. Analysis of cost-effectiveness indicated that Lee Silverman Voice Treatment LOUD did not offer value for money and the intervention cost more because more speech and language therapy time was needed to deliver it. Our next question is to ask how we can provide Lee Silverman Voice Treatment LOUD in a way that costs less, for example, using therapy assistants and computer packages or at home. Clear speech and language therapy approaches for people with Parkinson\u2019s disease and speech or voice problems should be tested in trials that measure changes in people\u2019s lives.",

    "abstract": "In the last few years, a plethora of biomarkers have been proposed for the differentiation of Parkinson's disease (PD) from its mimics. Most of them consist of complex measures, often based on expensive technology, not easily employed outside research centers. MRI measures have been widely used to differentiate between PD and other parkinsonism. However, these measurements were often performed manually on small brain areas in small patient cohorts with intra- and inter-rater variability. The aim of the current review is to provide a comprehensive and updated overview of the literature on biomarkers commonly used to differentiate PD from its mimics (including parkinsonism and tremor syndromes), focusing on parameters derived by simple qualitative or quantitative measurements that can be used in routine practice. Several electrophysiological, sonographic and MRI biomarkers have shown promising results, including the blink-reflex recovery cycle, tremor analysis, sonographic or MRI assessment of substantia nigra, and several qualitative MRI signs or simple linear measures to be directly performed on MR images. The most significant issue is that most studies have been conducted on small patient cohorts from a single center, with limited reproducibility of the findings. Future studies should be carried out on larger international cohorts of patients to ensure generalizability. Moreover, research on simple biomarkers should seek measurements to differentiate patients with different diseases but similar clinical phenotypes, distinguish subtypes of the same disease, assess disease progression, and correlate biomarkers with pathological data. An even more important goal would be to predict the disease in the preclinical phase.",

    "abstract": "Recently, it is discovered PF4 is a cognitive enhancer that improved the cognitive abilities of younger mice and gave older animals their middle-aged acuity back. PF4 works by reducing inflammation during the aging process. As we all known, aging is undoubtedly the main risk factor of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, inflammation has been extensively investigated and attracted even more interest. Therefore, the aim of the proposal is to highlight the worth of PF4 in inflammaging of neurodegenerative diseases, which might provide a potential therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "Primary cilia (PC) are microtubules-based, independent antennal-like sensory organelles, that are seen in most vertebrate cells of different types, including astrocytes and neurons. They send signals to cells to control many physiological and cellular processes by detecting changes in the extracellular environment. Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disease that progresses over time, is primarily caused by a gradual degradation of the dopaminergic pathway in the striatum nigra, which results in a large loss of neurons in the substantia nigra compact (SNpc) and a depletion of dopamine (DA). PD samples have abnormalities in the structure and function of PC. The alterations contribute to the cause, development, and recovery of PD via influencing signaling pathways (SHH, Wnt, Notch-1, \u03b1-syn, and TGF\u03b2), genes (MYH10 and LRRK2), defective mitochondrial function, and substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. Thus, restoring the normal structure and physiological function of PC and neurons in the brain are effective treatment for PD. This review summarizes the function of PC in neurodegenerative diseases and explores the pathological mechanisms caused by PC alterations in PD, in order to provide references and ideas for future research.",

    "abstract": "The existing literature on neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) reveals a common pathological feature: the accumulation of misfolded proteins. However, the heterogeneity in disease onset mechanisms and the specific brain regions affected complicates the understanding of the diverse clinical manifestations of individual NDDs. Dementia, a hallmark symptom across various NDDs, serves as a multifaceted denominator, contributing to the clinical manifestations of these disorders. There is a compelling hypothesis that therapeutic strategies capable of mitigating misfolded protein accumulation and disrupting ongoing pathogenic processes may slow or even halt disease progression. Recent research has linked disease-associated microglia to their transition into a senescent state-characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest-in aging populations and NDDs. Although senescent microglia are consistently observed in NDDs, few studies have utilized animal models to explore their role in disease pathology. Emerging evidence from experimental rat models suggests that disease-associated microglia exhibit characteristics of senescence, indicating that deeper exploration of microglial senescence could enhance our understanding of NDD pathogenesis and reveal novel therapeutic targets. This review underscores the importance of investigating microglial senescence and its potential contributions to the pathophysiology of NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Additionally, it highlights the potential of targeting microglial senescence through iron chelation and senolytic therapies as innovative approaches for treating age-related NDDs.",

    "abstract": "Glucose is the brain's main fuel source, used in both energy and molecular production. Impaired glucose metabolism is associated with adult and pediatric neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, and progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs). PMEs, a group of neurological disorders typical of childhood and adolescence, account for 1% of all epileptic diseases in this population worldwide. Diffuse glucose hypometabolism is observed in the brains of patients affected by PMEs such as Lafora disease (LD), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian (DRPLA) atrophy, Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD), and myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRFs). PMEs also include neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), a subgroup in which lysosomal and autophagy dysfunction leads to progressive loss of vision, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline. We examine the role of impaired glucose metabolism in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in the NCLs. Our literature review, which includes findings from case reports and animal studies, reveals that glucose hypometabolism is still poorly characterized both ",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation (PA) is a critical phenomenon associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Recent studies have suggested that factors like aggregation-prone regions (APRs) and \u03b2-strand interactions are crucial in understanding such behavior. While experimental methods have provided valuable insights, there has been a shift towards computational strategies, particularly machine learning, for their efficacy and speed. The challenge, however, lies in effectively incorporating structural information into these models. This study constructs a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to predict PA scores with the expanded and refined Protein Data Bank (PDB) and AlphaFold2.0 dataset. We employed AGGRESCAN3D 2.0 to calculate PA propensity and to enhance the dataset, we systematically separated multi polypeptide chains within PDB data into single polypeptide chains, removing redundancy. This effort resulted in a dataset comprising 302\u2009032 unique PDB entries. Subsequently, we compared sequence similarity and obtained 22\u2009774 ",

    "abstract": "Mentha aquatica L., or water mint, is an important member of the Mentha genus, and has long been used in traditional medicine, mainly to treat respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Nevertheless, although over the years many studies have shown that it's potential grows beyond this use, a review that highlights M. aquatica L.'s true potential is still lacking. Thus, the main purpose of the present article is to provide a thorough and multidisciplinary critical review of M. aquatica L., including its phytochemical characterization, main bioactivities, and current marketed cosmetic products. Many compounds have been identified as part of M. aquatica L. composition, such as terpenes, phenolic acids, phenols, and terpenoids, which have been linked to a vast therapeutic potential, namely anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, antiobesity, and hepatoprotection bioactivities, with additional anticancer potential for several types of tumors (breast, lung, and skin), and psycho and neuroactive potential in depression, or Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. Additionally, it has been proven to be suitable for cosmetic application since several cleansing, hydrating, protecting, and/or odor masking products containing it are already available, with the main functions attributed to M. aquatica including refreshing/cooling effects, calming/soothing/relaxing effects, and purifying effects, properties closely related to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant bioactivities. Hence, M. aquatica is an extremely versatile plant, with its extracts and essential oils having great therapeutic and cosmetic potential. With many marketed cosmetic products, future studies should focus on this plant's medicinal aspects, so that 1 day it can be part of therapeutic regimens.",

    "abstract": "Although recent meta-analyses have shown that the association between physical activity (PA) and the risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD) is influenced by gender differences, a growing number of studies are revealing the general applicability of this association across genders. This study aimed to reassess the association and dose-response relationship between PA and PD risk in populations.\nA systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases was conducted in this study from inception to February 1, 2024, without language restrictions. Stratified analyses were conducted to explore the association between PA and PD risk, combining multivariate-adjusted effect estimates via random-effects models, and to validate the dose-response relationship between the two.\nThis study included 21 observational studies, comprising 13 cohort studies and 8 case-control studies. The pooled analysis revealed that PA significantly reduced the risk of developing PD [relative risk (RR)\u2009=\u20090.77, 95% CI 0.70-0.85]. In addition, the dose-response analysis revealed both linear and nonlinear associations, with linear results indicating a 9% reduction in PD risk for every 10 MET-h/wk increase in PA. The study also demonstrated that the protective effect of PA against PD was significant for both sexes. Moreover, no statistically significant effects of PA on preventing PD were observed in individuals with a BMI\u2009>\u200926 (RR\u2009=\u20090.35, 95% CI 0.12-1.02) or in Asian populations (RR\u2009=\u20090.78, 95% CI 0.60-1.01); however, the trends suggest potential protective effects, warranting further investigation. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings.\nThis meta-analysis produced substantial evidence to reaffirm the protective effect of high PA on PD across various population groups and the inverse dose-response relationship with PD risk, and to validate the protective effect of PA among different demographic groups.",

    "results": "This study included 21 observational studies, comprising 13 cohort studies and 8 case-control studies. The pooled analysis revealed that PA significantly reduced the risk of developing PD [relative risk (RR)\u2009=\u20090.77, 95% CI 0.70-0.85]. In addition, the dose-response analysis revealed both linear and nonlinear associations, with linear results indicating a 9% reduction in PD risk for every 10 MET-h/wk increase in PA. The study also demonstrated that the protective effect of PA against PD was significant for both sexes. Moreover, no statistically significant effects of PA on preventing PD were observed in individuals with a BMI\u2009>\u200926 (RR\u2009=\u20090.35, 95% CI 0.12-1.02) or in Asian populations (RR\u2009=\u20090.78, 95% CI 0.60-1.01); however, the trends suggest potential protective effects, warranting further investigation. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings.",

    "abstract": "Despite the association between spinal cord injury (SCI) and various neurological diseases, the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in SCI is not elucidated yet. Especially, the role of SCI severity and injury level in the risk of PD development is not investigated. Based on the nation-wide cohort data the Korean National Health Insurance Service between 2010 and 2018, we investigated the incidence of PD in 7,182 patients with SCI compared with 24,844 age- and sex-matched controls. Adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. We compared the risk of PD based on the degree of disability (without disability, mild, severe) and SCI level (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar). During the mean follow-up duration of 4.31 years, patients with SCI had a higher risk of PD compared with matched controls. The PD risk was greater among patients with SCI with disability than in those without disability, especially those with mild disability. Additionally, cervical-level injury was associated with the highest risk in patients with SCI without disability, while thoracic-level injury was associated with the highest risk in those with disability. Our study found patients with SCI have increased risk of PD, particularly those with disability and thoracic-level injuries.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is linked to an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Parkinson disease (PD), yet several uncertainties still remain and the extent to which the associations could be explained by BD-related medications (antipsychotics, lithium, and antiepileptics) was unknown. This study included 501,233 UK Biobank participants (mean [standard deviation] age, 56.5 [8.10]\u2009years; 54.4% women), free of dementia and PD at baseline. After a median 13.8\u2009year follow-up, 9422 cases of dementia and 3457 PD cases were identified. Participants with BD had a significantly higher risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.52, 95% CI 2.00-3.19) and PD (adjusted HR 2.88, 95% CI 2.03-4.08). Findings suggest that up to two-thirds of the association of neurodegenerative diseases with BD may be mediated by BD-related medications. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of VNS in a lateral lesioned mice model of PD. Excluding controls, experimental mice received cuff electrode implantation on the left vagus nerve and 6-hydroxydopamine administration into the bilateral striatum. After ten days, electrical stimulation was delivered for 11 consecutive days onto PD animals. Behavioral tests were performed after stimulation. The expression of TH, Iba-1, GFAP, adrenergic receptors and cytokines in the SN and striatum was detected by immunofluorescence or western blotting. The activity of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) was also measured. Our results suggest that VNS improved behavioral performance in rod rotation, open field tests and pole-climbing tests in PD mice, accompanied by a decrease in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SN and increased TH expression in the striatum. Neuroinflammation-related factors, such as GFAP, Iba-1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were also suppressed in PD mice after VNS compared to those without treatment. Furthermore, the proportion of c-Fos-positive noradrenergic neurons in the LC increased when animals received VNS. Additionally, the expression of the adrenergic receptor of \u03b11BR was also upregulated after VNS compared to PD mice. In conclusion, VNS has potential as a novel PD therapy for neuroprotective effects, and indicate that activation of norepinephric neurons in LC may plays an important role in VNS treatment for PD.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence supports the link between peripheral inflammation and impairment of neurologic functions, including mood and cognitive abilities. The pathogenic event connecting peripheral inflammation and brain dysfunction is represented by neuroinflammation, a pathogenic phenomenon that provides an important contribution to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline also in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's diseases, as well as in Multiple Sclerosis. It is driven by resident brain immune cells, microglia and astrocytes, that acquire an activated phenotype in response to proinflammatory molecules moving from the periphery to the brain parenchyma. Although a huge progress has been made in clarifying cellular and molecular mechanisms bridging peripheral and central inflammation, a clear picture has not been achieved so far. Therefore, experimental models are of crucial relevance to clarify knowledge gaps in this regard. Many findings demonstrate that systemic inflammation induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is able to trigger neuroinflammation. Therefore, LPS-administration is widely considered a useful tool to study this phenomenon. On this basis, the present review will focus on in vivo studies based on acute and subacute effects of systemic administration of LPS, with special attention on the state of art of microglia and astrocyte response to peripheral challenge.",

Although alterations in sleep macrostructure have been reported in persons with neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), it is unknown whether there is a relationship between alterations in microstructure (sleep spindles) and global cognitive deficits in this disease.\nTo explore the association between the macro and microstructure of sleep (sleep spindles) and the general cognitive state in persons with PD.\nThirty-three patients with idiopathic PD underwent a one-night polysomnography (PSG) and a global cognitive assessment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. PSG-based macrostructural sleep values and quantification and spectral estimation of sleep spindles were obtained.\nWe found increases in total sleep time, latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and percentage of N1 stage, as well as a decrease in percentage of REM sleep and sleep efficiency compared to values reported in healthy adults. Compared to expected values, a decrease in the number of sleep spindles was found at frontal regions. Participants with cognitive impairment showed an even lower count of sleep spindles, as well as an increase in the amplitude of underlying sigma (12-16\u00a0Hz) waves (fast spindles). When exploring MoCA subdomains, we found a consistent relationship between the number and amplitude of sleep spindles and attention capacity.\nDecreased number and increased amplitude of sleep spindles are linked to cognitive impairment in persons with PD, especially in attention capacity. Therefore, sleep spindles characteristics could serve as prognostic indicators of cognitive deterioration in PD.",

    "abstract": "Gulf War illness (GWI) is characterized by a constellation of symptoms, including, but not limited to, diarrhea, fatigue, and memory problems that affect Gulf War veterans. Currently, there are no objective biomarkers for GWI. Previous studies have identified differences in optical coherence tomography (OCT) metrics between individuals with GWI symptoms and those without. However, there are limited data on how these metrics change over time. Therefore, in this current study, we conducted a prospective case-control investigation to determine if OCT metrics show longitudinal changes in those affected by GWI.\nWe conducted a prospective study with 100 Gulf War-era veterans at the Miami Veterans Affairs Hospital from November 2018 to February 2022. Inclusion criteria required service during 1990-1991, with both deployed and nondeployed veterans included. Exclusions were based on factors like active infection, unmanaged psychotic disorders, significant head injuries, severe neurological disorders, and eye pathologies affecting OCT imaging. All participants provided informed consent, and the study was institutional review board-approved and conducted per the Declaration of Helsinki and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guidelines. GWI symptoms were assessed using the modified Kansas questionnaire, categorizing veterans into groups based on GWI symptoms presence and deployment status. Data on demographics, comorbidities, medications, and medical and ocular diagnoses were collected. Participants underwent OCT imaging at 2 time points, 1\u2009year apart, with macular, retinal nerve fiber layer, and ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer (GCL-IPL) thicknesses measured. Additionally, blood samples were collected and cytokine levels measured at baseline. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, t-tests, and multivariable regression models. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 28.0.\nLogistic regression demonstrated that post-traumatic stress disorder (odds ratio [OR]: 8.18, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.327-28.851, P\u2009=\u2009.001) and a lower baseline macular thickness in the outer nasal segment (OR: 0.959, 95% CI: 0.924-0.994, P\u2009=\u2009.023) remained significantly associated with GWI symptoms. The model also found that individuals with GWI symptoms were more likely to have an increase in inner temporal GCL-IPL layer thickness over a 1-year period (OR: 1.187, 95% CI: 0.974-1.447, P\u2009=\u2009.089). When analysis was conducted only among those deployed, only baseline interleukin (IL) 1a (OR\u2009=\u20091.24, CI\u2009=\u20091.019-1.52, P\u2009=\u2009.03) and interleukin-10 (OR\u2009=\u20090.95, CI\u2009=\u20090.91-0.99, P\u2009=\u2009.02) levels remained significantly associated with GWI symptoms.\nBaseline OCT measures, especially a thinner outer nasal macula, were associated with GWI symptoms. Longitudinally, individuals with GWI symptoms had greater thickening of their inferotemporal GCL compared to those without symptoms. When the model was re-examined in deployed veterans, OCT measures (at baseline and longitudinally) no longer remained significantly related with GWI symptoms and instead baseline levels of plasma inflammatory cytokine markers, IL1a and IL10, were most closely related to symptoms. Our longitudinal study builds on our previous retrospective and cross-sectional work on identifying ocular biomarkers in GWI. Across the studies, macular thinning at baseline and inferotemporal GCL-IPL thickening have been noted between cases and controls. Some of these findings share correlates with OCT biomarkers identified in conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Multiple Sclerosis. This is significant as it may help contextualize future research and help us develop better models of GWI.",

    "abstract": "Rhythmic auditory cueing (RAC) using an isochronous metronome is an effective approach to immediately enhance spatiotemporal aspects of gait for people with Parkinson disease (PwPD). Whereas entraining to RAC typically occurs subconsciously via cerebellar pathways, the use of metronome frequencies that deviate from one's typical cadence, such as those used in rehabilitation, may require conscious awareness. This heightened awareness may increase cognitive load and limit the persistence of gait training gains. Here, we explore the immediate effects of incorporating an implicit motor learning approach (i.e., error-based recalibration) to gait training with RAC. Twenty older adults (10 with PD and 10 controls) were asked to match their footfalls to both isochronous and subtly varying metronomes while walking on a treadmill and overground. Our findings revealed intriguing differences between treadmill and overground walking. During treadmill walking to a slower metronome frequency, both groups reduced their cadence and increased step lengths, but did not make the necessary adjustments to match the subtly varying metronome. During overground walking, both groups modified their cadence in response to a 3-4% change in metronome frequency (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Both metronomes yielded evidence of implicit and explicit retention during overground and treadmill walking. Furthermore, during overground walking the PD group showed greater implicit retention of cadence changes following the varying metronome, compared to the isochronous metronome. Our results suggest that incorporating implicit motor learning approaches to gait training during a single session of overground walking may enhance short term implicit retention of gait behaviors for PwPD.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a well-recognized and debilitating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). Degradation in the cortical cholinergic system is thought to be a key contributor. Both postmortem and in vivo cholinergic positron emission tomography (PET) studies have provided valuable evidence of cholinergic system changes in PD, which are pronounced in PD dementia (PDD). A growing body of literature has employed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a noninvasive, more cost-effective alternative to PET, to examine cholinergic system structural changes in PD. This review provides a comprehensive discussion of the methodologies and findings of studies that have focused on the relationship between cholinergic basal forebrain (cBF) integrity, based on T1- and diffusion-weighted MRI, and cognitive function in PD. Nucleus basalis of Meynert (Ch4) volume has been consistently reduced in cognitively impaired PD samples and has shown potential utility as a prognostic indicator for future cognitive decline. However, the extent of structural changes in Ch4, especially in early stages of cognitive decline in PD, remains unclear. In addition, evidence for structural change in anterior cBF regions in PD has not been well established. This review underscores the importance of continued cross-sectional and longitudinal research to elucidate the role of cholinergic dysfunction in the cognitive manifestations of PD. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Most patients with isolated rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) progress to a parkinsonian alpha-synucleinopathy. However, time to phenoconversion shows great variation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether cholinergic and dopaminergic dysfunction in iRBD patients was associated with impending phenoconversion.\nTwenty-one polysomnography-confirmed iRBD patients underwent baseline \nFollow-up was accomplished in 17 patients. Eight patients progressed to either Parkinson's disease (n\u2009=\u20094) or dementia with Lewy bodies (n\u2009=\u20094), while nine remained non-phenoconverters. Compared with non-phenoconverters, 8-year phenoconverters had lower mean \nThese findings suggest that cortical cholinergic dysfunction, particularly within the parietal cortex, could be a biomarker candidate for predicting short-term phenoconversion in iRBD patients. This study aligns with previous reports suggesting dopaminergic dysfunction is associated with forthcoming phenoconversion.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess and visually depict the clinical evidence landscape of traditional Chinese exercises and identify any research gaps and future research needs.\nWe comprehensively searched seven Chinese and English databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs) evaluating the effects of traditional Chinese exercises from their inception until May 2023. The quality of evidence was assessed via the GRADE approach, and the research topics, intervention effects, and strength of evidence were graphically displayed.\nThis evidence map includes 2,017 studies, comprising 1,822 RCTs and 195 SRs. These studies were conducted globally in various countries. Among the traditional Chinese exercises, Tai Chi and Baduanjin have received the most research attention, with a growing number of publications. When traditional Chinese exercises were compared with the control groups, 88.2% of the included SRs reported significantly positive effects, 4.1% reported unclear effects, and 7.7% reported no significant differences. The findings suggested that traditional Chinese exercises could benefit patients with osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, Parkinson's disease, anxiety, and depression. However, the overall quality of the evidence was suboptimal, with 11.3% rated as moderate, 45.6% as low, and 43.1% as critically low.\nThis evidence map visually represents valuable information on traditional Chinese exercises. While most studies have reported significant benefits, the overall quality of evidence is low.",

    "results": "This evidence map includes 2,017 studies, comprising 1,822 RCTs and 195 SRs. These studies were conducted globally in various countries. Among the traditional Chinese exercises, Tai Chi and Baduanjin have received the most research attention, with a growing number of publications. When traditional Chinese exercises were compared with the control groups, 88.2% of the included SRs reported significantly positive effects, 4.1% reported unclear effects, and 7.7% reported no significant differences. The findings suggested that traditional Chinese exercises could benefit patients with osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, Parkinson's disease, anxiety, and depression. However, the overall quality of the evidence was suboptimal, with 11.3% rated as moderate, 45.6% as low, and 43.1% as critically low.",

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses an important obstacle to treating neurological disorders because it limits the entry of therapeutic agents into the central nervous system (CNS). Surmounting this barrier is crucial for delivering drugs effectively and targeting precise areas of the brain affected by conditions like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and brain tumors. This review examines the diverse strategies employed to enhance brain targeting, including nanotechnology, viral vectors, and biological therapies. Nanoparticles, liposomes, and dendrimers offer promising approaches for encapsulating drugs and facilitating their transport across the BBB. Viral vectors, such as adeno-associated viruses, demonstrate high transfection efficiency for gene therapy applications in CNS diseases. Biological therapies, including stem cell transplantation and neuromodulation techniques, can potentially restore normal cellular function and treat genetic disorders. Challenges such as BBB permeability, safety concerns, and regulatory considerations are discussed, along with future perspectives on precision medicine, noninvasive delivery methods, and biomarker discovery. By addressing these challenges and embracing innovative approaches, the field of brain drug targeting aims to transfer the way that neurological illness is treated and improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction stands as a prevalent and consequential non-motor manifestation in Parkinson's disease (PD). Although dysfunction of the olfactory system has been recognized as an important predictor of cognitive decline, the exact mechanism by which aberrant olfactory circuits contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD is unclear. Here, we provide the first evidence for abnormal functional connectivity across olfactory bulb (OB) and piriform cortex (PC) or entorhinal cortex (EC) by clinical fMRI, and dysfunction of neural coherence in the olfactory system in PD mice. Moreover, we discovered that 2 subpopulations of mitral/tufted (M/T) cells in OB projecting to anterior PC (aPC) and EC precisely mediated the process of cognitive memory respectively by neural coherence at specific frequencies in mice. In addition, the transcriptomic profiling analysis and functional genetic regulation analysis further revealed that biorientation defective 1 (",

Although various treatment options are available, they are not ideal for Pakistan due to their high cost, restricted availability, and time sensitivity. In 1997, the FDA-approved deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease and it was first performed in Pakistan in 2014. DBS has also proved effective for restoring post-stroke mobility, according to a trial from August 2023. DBS has the potential to revolutionize post-stroke rehabilitation in Pakistan; however, further research is required into its effectiveness and its limitations must be addressed first.",

However, whether interferon regulatory factor 7-mediated signaling contributes to Parkinson's disease remains unknown. Here we report that interferon regulatory factor 7 is markedly up-regulated in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease and co-localizes with microglial cells. Both the selective cyclic guanosine monophosphate adenosine monophosphate synthase inhibitor RU.521 and the stimulator of interferon genes inhibitor H151 effectively suppressed interferon regulatory factor 7 activation in BV2 microglia exposed to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium and inhibited transformation of mouse BV2 microglia into the neurotoxic M1 phenotype. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of interferon regulatory factor 7 expression in BV2 microglia reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, CD16, CD32, and CD86 and increased the expression of the anti-inflammatory markers ARG1 and YM1. Taken together, our findings indicate that the cyclic guanosine monophosphate adenosine monophosphate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes-interferon regulatory factor 7 pathway plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology speculates that neuromelanin (NM) and iron ions play a significant role in physiological and pathological conditions of PD. Because the difficult accessibility of NM has limited targeted research, synthetic melanin-like nanoparticles have been used to instead. In this report, the eumelanin and pheomelanin-like polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles are prepared that can be used to simulate natural NM with or without chelating iron ion and studied the redox effects in vitro and in vivo on neuronal cells and PD. The synthetic pheomelanin-like PDA nanoparticles have much stronger redox activity than eumelanin-like PDA nanoparticles without or with iron ion. They can protect neurons by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), while cause neuronal cell death and PD due to excessive binding of iron ions. This work provides new evidence for the relationship among two structural components of NM and iron in PD as well as displays the different effects on the roles of eumelanin and pheomelanin in redox activity under physiological or pathological conditions, which provide a new effective choice for cellular and animal models of PD and offer theoretical guidance for targeted treatment and mechanism research on PD.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a disabling motor symptom prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD); however, its pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) pattern alterations in PD patients with FOG. A total of 18 PD patients, 10 with FOG (PD-FOG) and 8 without FOG (PD-nFOG), and 10 healthy controls were enrolled. High-resolution 3D T1-weighted and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data were obtained from all participants. The groups' internetwork connectivity differences were explored with rs-fMRI FC using seed-based analysis and graph theory. Multiple linear regression analysis estimated the relationship between FC changes and clinical measurements. Rs-fMRI analysis demonstrated alterations in FC in various brain regions between the three groups. Freezing of Gait Questionnaire severity was correlated with decreased brain functional connection between Vermis12 and the left temporal occipital fusiform cortex (r\u2009=\u2009-0.82, P\u2009<\u2009.001). Graph theory topological metrics indicated a decreased clustering coefficient in the right superior temporal gyrus in the PD-nFOG group. PD-FOG patients exhibited a compensatory increase in connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus language network and the postcentral gyrus compared to PD-nFOG patients. Further, the decreased connection between Vermis 12 and the left temporal occipital fusiform cortex may serve as a potential neuroimaging biomarker for tracking PD-FOG and distinguishing between PD subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) and gait impairment are frequent sources of disability in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the impact of nOH on balance and gait features remains unclear. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the influence of nOH on postural and gait parameters in a cohort of patients with PD by means of wearable inertial sensors.\nGait and balance were assessed using Opal inertial sensors. nOH was defined as sustained systolic blood pressure (BP) drop\u2009\u2265\u200920\u00a0mmHg or diastolic BP drop\u2009\u2265\u200910\u00a0mmHg within 3\u00a0min of standing, with a \u0394HR/\u0394SBP ratio\u2009\u2264\u20090.5\u00a0bpm/mmHg. Analysis of covariance was performed to evaluate differences in gait/balance features between patients with and without nOH, adjusting for age, cognitive status, and motor disability. Moreover, we performed the same analysis considering the presence of hemodynamically relevant nOH (orthostatic mean BP\u2009\u2264\u200975\u00a0mmHg).\nA total of 82 patients were enrolled, 26 with nOH (31.7%), of which 13 presented with hemodynamically relevant nOH. After correcting for confounders, nOH was independently associated with lower gait speed (p\u2009=\u20090.027), shorter stride length (p\u2009=\u20090.033), longer time for postural transitions (p\u2009=\u20090.004), and increased postural sway (p\u2009=\u20090.019). These differences were even more pronounced in patients with hemodynamically relevant nOH. Higher postural sway was associated with a 7.9-fold higher odds of falls (p\u2009=\u20090.040).\nOur study presents an objective demonstration of the independent negative impact of nOH on gait and balance in PD, emphasizing the need for careful detection and management of nOH to mitigate gait and balance disturbances in PD.",

    "results": "A total of 82 patients were enrolled, 26 with nOH (31.7%), of which 13 presented with hemodynamically relevant nOH. After correcting for confounders, nOH was independently associated with lower gait speed (p\u2009=\u20090.027), shorter stride length (p\u2009=\u20090.033), longer time for postural transitions (p\u2009=\u20090.004), and increased postural sway (p\u2009=\u20090.019). These differences were even more pronounced in patients with hemodynamically relevant nOH. Higher postural sway was associated with a 7.9-fold higher odds of falls (p\u2009=\u20090.040).",

    "abstract": "High-sensitivity acceleration sensors have been independently developed by our research group to detect vibrations that are >\u200910 dB smaller than those detected by conventional commercial sensors. This study is the first to measure high-frequency micro-vibrations in muscle fibers, termed micro-mechanomyogram (MMG) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) using a high-sensitivity acceleration sensor. We specifically measured the extensor pollicis brevis muscle at the base of the thumb in PwPD and healthy controls (HC) and detected not only low-frequency MMG (<\u200915\u00a0Hz) but also micro-MMG (\u2265\u200915\u00a0Hz), which was preciously undetectable using commercial acceleration sensors. Analysis revealed remarkable differences in the frequency characteristics of micro-MMG between PwPD and HC. Specifically, during muscle power output, the low-frequency MMG energy was greater in PwPD than in HC, while the micro-MMG energy was smaller in PwPD compared to HC. These results suggest that micro-MMG detected by the high-sensitivity acceleration sensor provides crucial information for distinguishing between PwPD and HC. Moreover, a deep learning model trained on both low-frequency MMG and micro-MMG achieved a high accuracy (92.19%) in classifying PwPD and HC, demonstrating the potential for a diagnostic system for PwPD using micro-MMG.",

    "abstract": "Mitophagy mediated by the recessive Parkinson's disease genes PINK1 and Parkin responds to mitochondrial damage to preserve mitochondrial function. In the pathway, PINK1 is the damage sensor, probing the integrity of the mitochondrial import pathway, and activating Parkin when import is blocked. Parkin is the effector, selectively marking damaged mitochondria with ubiquitin for mitophagy and other quality-control processes. This selective mitochondrial quality-control pathway may be especially critical for dopamine neurons affected in Parkinson's disease, in which the mitochondrial network is widely distributed throughout a highly branched axonal arbor. Here we review the current understanding of the role of PINK1-Parkin in the quality control of mitophagy, including sensing of mitochondrial distress by PINK1, activation of Parkin by PINK1 to induce mitophagy, and the physiological relevance of the PINK1-Parkin pathway.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the brain requires studying its multiscale interactions from molecules to networks. The increasing availability of large-scale datasets detailing brain circuit composition, connectivity, and activity is transforming neuroscience. However, integrating and interpreting this data remains challenging. Concurrently, advances in supercomputing and sophisticated modeling tools now enable the development of highly detailed, large-scale biophysical circuit models. These mechanistic multiscale models offer a method to systematically integrate experimental data, facilitating investigations into brain structure, function, and disease. This review, based on a Society for Neuroscience 2024 MiniSymposium, aims to disseminate recent advances in large-scale mechanistic modeling to the broader community. It highlights (1) examples of current models for various brain regions developed through experimental data integration; (2) their predictive capabilities regarding cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying experimental recordings (e.g., membrane voltage, spikes, local-field potential, electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography) and brain function; and (3) their use in simulating biomarkers for brain diseases like epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's, aiding in understanding their biophysical underpinnings and developing novel treatments. The review showcases state-of-the-art models covering hippocampus, somatosensory, visual, motor, auditory cortical, and thalamic circuits across species. These models predict neural activity at multiple scales and provide insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying sensation, motor behavior, brain signals, neural coding, disease, pharmacological interventions, and neural stimulation. Collaboration with experimental neuroscientists and clinicians is essential for the development and validation of these models, particularly as datasets grow. Hence, this review aims to foster interest in detailed brain circuit models, leading to cross-disciplinary collaborations that accelerate brain research.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by impaired motor function, is typically treated with medications and surgery. However, recent studies have validated physical exercise as an effective adjunct therapy, significantly improving both motor and non-motor symptoms in PD patients. Irisin, a myokine, has garnered increasing attention for its beneficial effects on the nervous system. Research has shown that irisin plays a crucial role in regulating metabolic balance, optimizing autophagy, maintaining mitochondrial quality, alleviating oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and regulating cell death-all processes intricately linked to the pathogenesis of PD. This review examines the mechanisms through which irisin may counteract PD, provides insights into its biological effects, and considers its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased in our society in recent decades as the population ages, and this trend is not expected to revert. This is the same for the incidence of the main neurodegenerative disorders, including the two most common ones, which are, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Currently, no pharmacological therapies have been developed to revert or cure any of these pathologies. Interestingly, in recent years, an increased number of studies have shown a high co-morbidity between T2DM and neurodegeneration, as well as some common molecular pathways that are affected in both types of diseases. For example, while the etiopathology of T2DM and neurodegenerative disorders is highly complex, mitochondrial dysfunction has been broadly described in the early steps of both diseases; accordingly, this dysfunction has emerged as a plausible molecular link between them. In fact, the prominent role played by mitochondria in the mammalian metabolism of glucose places the physiology of the organelle in a central position to regulate many cellular processes that are affected in both T2DM and neurodegenerative disorders. In this collaborative review, we critically describe the relationship between T2DM and neurodegeneration; making a special emphasis on the mitochondrial mechanisms that could link these diseases. A better understanding of the role of mitochondria on the etiopathology of T2DM and neurodegeneration could pave the way for the development of new pharmacological therapies focused on the regulation of the physiology of the organelle. These therapies could, ultimately, contribute to increase healthspan.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) has remained largely unchanged and focuses primarily on symptomatic relief through activation of dopaminergic pathways. Currently, there are no proven prophylactic approaches to the prevention of PD. This systematic review seeks to compare two separate compounds, metformin (MTF) and psilocybin, as potential prophylactic therapeutics against the development of PD.\nThe authors conducted a systematic review focusing on primary studies that test these compounds on cell and animal models to determine if they might have any neuroprotective or neuroplastic effects.\nThe results of this review found that MTF may halt the progression of diseases such as PD through multiple mechanisms including reduced oxidative stress at the level of the mitochondria, thereby reducing \u03b1-synuclein related damage. Psilocybin, on the other hand, may increase repair of damaged neurons through psychoplastogenic activation of serotonergic pathways, particularly 5-HT\nImplications of this study include a need for further research in off-label use of MTF as well as further research into serotonergic compounds such as psilocybin for the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is one of the most significant challenges confronting modern societies, affecting millions of patients globally each year. The pathophysiology of PD is significantly influenced by mitochondrial dysfunction, as evident by the contribution of altered mitochondrial dynamics, bioenergetics, and increased oxidative stress to neuronal death. This review examines the potential use of small molecules that target mitochondria as a therapeutic approach for treating PD. Progress in mitochondrial biology has revealed various mitochondrial targets that can be modulated to restore function and mitigate neurodegeneration. Small molecules that promote mitochondrial biogenesis, enhance mitochondrial dynamics, decrease oxidative stress, and prevent the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) have shown promise in preclinical models. Additionally, targeting mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, such as mitophagy, provides another therapeutic approach. This review explores recent research on small molecules targeting mitochondria, examines their mechanisms of action, and assesses their potential efficacy and safety profiles. By highlighting the most promising candidates and addressing the challenges and future directions in this field, this review aims to offer a comprehensive overview of current and future prospects for mitochondrial-targeted therapies in PD. Ultimately, treating mitochondrial dysfunction holds significant promise for developing disease-modifying PD medications, giving patients hope for better outcomes and improved quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Heterozygous variants in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene are the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's Disease (PD). GBA1-PD patients exhibit earlier disease onset, severe motor impairment, and heightened cognitive decline. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) offers motor improvement for PD patients, but its cognitive effects, particularly in GBA1-PD, are debated.\nThis study involved 96 PD patients who underwent subthalamic nucleus DBS at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau between 2004 and 2023. Clinical and neuropsychological assessments were conducted pre- and post-surgery, focusing on Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) and Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe). Patients were categorized into GBA1-PD and non-GBA1-PD groups, with non-GBA1-PD further divided into cognitive fast-progressors and slow-progressors.\nGBA1 variants were present in 13.5\u00a0% of patients. GBA1-PD patients showed greater cognitive decline over time, particularly in attention, conceptualization, and memory, compared to non-GBA1-PD. Non-GBA1-PD fast-progressors exhibited significant cognitive deterioration in initiation and conceptualization within the first year post-DBS. Motor outcomes improved similarly across all groups, but slow-progressors showed a greater reduction in Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD).\nGBA1-PD patients experience more rapid cognitive decline, particularly in posterior-cortical and fronto-striatal functions. Additionally, a subset of non-GBA1-PD patients shows significant early cognitive decline post-DBS, especially in executive functions. Baseline MDRS scores do not predict cognitive outcomes, highlighting the need for further research to refine prognostic tools. Despite cognitive challenges, GBA1-PD patients benefit from DBS in terms of motor outcomes, underscoring the importance of individualized assessments for DBS suitability, regardless of genetic status.",

However, it remains unclear for mechanistic knowledge on how CR3 mediates neuronal damage. In this study, the expression of CR3 and its ligands iC3b and ICAM-1 was found to be up-regulated in the midbrain of rotenone PD mice, which was associated with elevation of iron content and disruption of balance of iron metabolism proteins. Interestingly, genetic deletion of CR3 blunted iron accumulation and recovered the expression of iron metabolism markers in response to rotenone. Furthermore, reduced lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis of dopaminergic neurons and neuroinflammation were detected in rotenone-lesioned CR3",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms (NMS), which affect the patient's quality of life (QOL). This study aimed to compare QOL and background in patients with PD based on the disease duration and investigate the factors affecting QOL. Patients with PD were evaluated based on age, sex, disease duration (\u22645\u00a0years and\u00a0>\u00a05\u00a0years groups), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Japanese version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J), Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), Hoehn and Yahr (HY) severity, movement disorder society-sponsored revision of the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (MDS-UPDRS) parts I-IV, and QOL using the Parkinson's disease questionnaire (PDQ-8). Overall, 102 patients with PD (58 males; mean age\u00a0=\u00a070.0\u00a0years; mean disease duration\u00a0=\u00a07.3\u00a0years) were included in this study. QOL was significantly correlated (r\u00a0>\u00a00.30, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) with disease duration and MDS-UPDRS parts I-IV total scores. When the PDQ-8 total score was compared with MDS-UPDRS parts I-IV total scores based on disease duration classification, it was positively correlated with the scores for parts I and II in the >5\u00a0years group. Moreover, MDS-UPDRS parts I and II total scores appeared to be the factors most significantly affecting QOL. The factors affecting QOL in patients with PD were subjective NMS and motor symptoms. Since, physician-rated motor symptoms were not associated with QOL in patients with >5\u00a0years PD, subjective symptoms should be evaluated and treated to maintain QOL.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, and it remains incurable. Currently there is no definitive biomarker for detecting PD, measuring its severity, or monitoring of treatments. Recently, oculomotor fixation abnormalities have emerged as a sensitive biomarker to discriminate Parkinsonian patterns from a control population, even at early stages. For oculomotor analysis, current experimental setups use invasive and restrictive capture protocols that limit the transfer in clinical routine. Alternatively, computational approaches to support the PD diagnosis are strictly based on supervised strategies, depending of large labeled data, and introducing an inherent expert-bias. This work proposes a self-supervised architecture based on Riemannian deep representation to learn oculomotor fixation patterns from compact descriptors. Firstly, deep convolutional features are recovered from oculomotor fixation video slices, and then encoded in compact symmetric positive matrices (SPD) to summarize second-order relationships. Each SPD input matrix is projected onto a Riemannian encoder until obtain a SPD embedding. Then, a Riemannian decoder reconstructs SPD matrices while preserving the geometrical manifold structure. The proposed architecture successfully recovers geometric patterns in the embeddings without any label diagnosis supervision, and demonstrates the capability to be discriminative regarding PD patterns. In a retrospective study involving 13 healthy adults and 13 patients diagnosed with PD, the proposed Riemannian representation achieved an average accuracy of 95.6% and an AUC of 99% during a binary classification task using a Support Vector Machine.",

    "abstract": "A breadth of preclinical studies now support the rationale of pluripotent stem cell-derived cell replacement therapies to alleviate motor symptoms in Parkinsonian patients. Replacement of the primary dysfunctional cell population in the disease, i.e. the A9 dopaminergic neurons, is the major focus of these therapies. To achieve this, most therapeutical approaches involve grafting single-cell suspensions of DA progenitors. However, most cells die during the transplantation process, as cells face ano\u00efkis. One potential solution to address this challenge is to graft solid preparations, i.e. adopting a 3D format. Cryopreserving such a format remains a major hurdle and is not exempt from causing delays in the time to effect, as observed with cryopreserved single-cell DA progenitors. Here, we used a high-throughput cell-encapsulation technology coupled with bioreactors to provide a 3D culture environment enabling the directed differentiation of hiPSCs into neural microtissues. The proper patterning of these neural microtissues into a midbrain identity was confirmed using orthogonal methods, including qPCR, RNAseq, flow cytometry and immunofluorescent microscopy. The efficacy of the neural microtissues was demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner using a Parkinsonian rat model. The survival of the cells was confirmed by post-mortem histological analysis, characterised by the presence of human dopaminergic neurons projecting into the host striatum. The work reported here is the first bioproduction of a cell therapy for Parkinson's disease in a scalable bioreactor, leading to a full behavioural recovery 16 weeks after transplantation using cryopreserved 3D format.",

Sphingolipids control various cellular actions like growth, homeostasis, and stress-related responses. The main sources of S1P in our body are erythrocytes. S1P controls both cellular mediators and other second messengers intracellularly. The S1P receptor also helps in inflammatory and neuroprotective effects (required to manage of Parkinson's). A large number of anti-Parkinson drugs are available, but still, there is a need for more effective and safer drugs. S1P and its receptors could be targeted as novel drugs due to their involvement in neuro-inflammation and Parkinson's. The present review effort to explore the biological role of S1P and related receptors, for their possible involvement in PD; furthermore. Overall, S1P and other related metabolizing enzymes have significant therapeutic opportunities for Parkinson's disease along with other neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor symptoms due to loss of brain dopamine and non-motor symptoms, including gastrointestinal disorders. Although there is no cure for PD, symptomatic treatments are available. L-Dopa is the gold standard PD therapy, but most patients develop dyskinesias (LID), which are challenging to manage. Amantadine is recognized as the most effective drug for LID, but its adverse effects limit the use in patients. Here we review how 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs), drugs used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia and alopecia, exhibit beneficial effects in PD animal models. 5ARIs show neuroprotective properties in brain and gut dopaminergic systems, and reduce dyskinesias in rodent model of PD. Additionally, the 5ARI finasteride dampened dopaminergic-induced drug gambling in PD patients. Neuroprotection and antidyskinetic activities of 5ARIs in animal models of PD suggest their potential repurposing in men with PD to address gut dysfunction, protect brain DA and inhibit dyskinesias.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodebilitating disorder that affects both motor and non-motor functions. PD is the second most commonly occurring brain disorder after Alzheimer's disease. The incidence rate of PD was found to be 17 per 100000 per year. The prevalence of the disease is at its peak at age 70 and older. One of the major reasons for the failure to devise a complete therapeutic cure for PD is an inability to identify the exact pathological cause. Recent research has also stated that PD originates in the gut way before the symptoms begin to manifest in an affected person. This might be due to the transmission of pathological alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) from the gut to the brain via the vagus nerve. The involvement of toxic environmental exposure in the generation of major disorders like cancer, brain disorders etc, is not an entirely new notion. Our genes are affected directly by the environment. Simultaneously, a number of environmental pollutants may contribute significantly to the trigger of alpha-synuclein misfolding in the brain during PD. In the present review, we will mainly focus on understanding the pathological cascade of PD and how it is triggered by environmental pollutants.",

    "abstract": "Tracking of emergent symptoms (ES) in de novo Parkinson Disease (PD) patients using Parts Ib and II of the MDS-UPDRS rating scale has been proposed as an outcome measure for PD clinical trials, based on observations in the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy Assessment of Isradipine for PD (STEADY-PD3) clinical trial.\nIndividual item-level data was extracted from the SURE-PD3 study (coded as \"PD-1018\" in the C-path pooled dataset). We sought to confirm the observations made in the STEADY-PD3 dataset by analyzing data from a different Phase 3 clinical trial, the Phase 3 Study of Urate Elevation in Parkinson Disease (SURE-PD3), in which MDS-UPDRS was assessed more frequently than the 12-month intervals in STEADY-PD3, using similar methodology.\nWe were able to broadly validate results that demonstrated the frequency of ES, lack of impact of the introduction of symptomatic medications, and in the reduction in sample size required to demonstrate slowing of disease progression at a group level compared with the traditional total MDS-UPDRS summed score scoring methods. Counts of ES generally correlated modestly with summed MDS-UPRDS scores, both for the various sub-parts and for the overall scale as well. However, instability of individual item responses, especially during the first 6 months of observation complicated the assessment of the temporal evolution and stability of ES over time in the course of the SURE-PD3 study.\nFurther validation using data sets with frequent administration of MDS-UPDRS is necessary to assess value of this approach as an outcome measure in PD clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The aim of designing this clinical trial is to investigate the impact of a nicotine-rich diet with/without protein redistribution on the motor indices of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nWe randomly divided 45 patients (age\u00a0>\u00a050) with PD into three groups including: nicotine-rich diet (20\u00a0\u00b5g per day) group (group N; n\u00a0=\u00a015), nicotine-rich diet with protein redistribution group (group N\u00a0+\u00a0P; n\u00a0=\u00a015), and control group (group C; n\u00a0=\u00a015). In all group, the diet was isocaloric, and participants received six meals and snacks. After 12\u00a0weeks, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS), serum alpha-synuclein levels, serum apolipoprotein A1, serum cotinine, and anthropometric parameters were measured in the three groups before and 12\u00a0weeks after the beginning of the study.\nAll of the enrolled patients completed the study. The UPDRS score was improved by 1.47 and 1.95 units in the N and N\u00a0+\u00a0P groups compared to the placebo (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). On the other hand, effect size of N and N\u00a0+\u00a0P diets for \u03b1-synuclein were -52.82 and -175.85, respectively. The differences were significant compared to the control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Also, the effect of the both diets on serum cotinine compared to the control group was significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Although the effect size for UPDRS, \u03b1-synuclein, and cotinine in N\u00a0+\u00a0P diet were higher than N group, the differences were not statistically significant (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Also, the obtained results showed that there were no significant effects on anthropometric variables and serum levels of Apolipoprotein A1 in diet-receiving groups (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05).\nThe results of our study indicated that nicotine consumption in an isocaloric diet, while preventing a decrease in anthropometric indices, leads to improvements in motor indices and a reduction in alpha-synuclein levels. Additional and larger controlled trials are required to validate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Clinical routine data derived from university hospitals hold immense value for health-related research on large cohorts. However, using secondary data for hypothesis testing necessitates adherence to scientific, legal (such as the General Data Protection Regulation, federal and state protection legislations), technical, and administrative requirements. This process is intricate, time-consuming, and susceptible to errors.\nThis study aims to develop a platform that enables clinicians to use current real-world data for testing research and evaluate advantages and limitations at a large university medical center (542,944 patients in 2022).\nWe identified requirements from clinical practitioners, conceptualized and implemented a platform based on the existing components, and assessed its applicability in clinical reality quantitatively and qualitatively.\nThe proposed platform was established at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf and made 639 forms encompassing 10,629 data elements accessible to all resident scientists and clinicians. Every day, the number of patients rises, and parts of their electronic health records are made accessible through the platform. Qualitatively, we were able to conduct a retrospective analysis of Parkinson disease over 777 patients, where we provide additional evidence for a significantly higher proportion of action tremors in patients with rest tremors (340/777, 43.8%) compared with those without rest tremors (255/777, 32.8%), as determined by a chi-square test (P<.001). Quantitatively, our findings demonstrate increased user engagement within the last 90 days, underscoring clinicians' increasing adoption of the platform in their regular research activities. Notably, the platform facilitated the retrieval of clinical data from 600,000 patients, emphasizing its substantial added value.\nThis study demonstrates the feasibility of simplifying the use of clinical data to enhance exploration and sustainability in scientific research. The proposed platform emerges as a potential technological and legal framework for other medical centers, providing them with the means to unlock untapped potential within their routine data.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress has long been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis, although the sources and regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are poorly defined. Pathogenic mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with increased kinase activity and a greater risk of PD. The substrates and downstream consequences of elevated LRRK2 kinase activity are still being elucidated, but overexpression of mutant LRRK2 has been associated with oxidative stress, and antioxidants reportedly mitigate LRRK2 toxicity. Here, using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited HEK293 cells, RAW264.7 macrophages, rat primary ventral midbrain cultures, and PD patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells, we found that elevated LRRK2 kinase activity was associated with increased ROS production and lipid peroxidation and that this was blocked by inhibitors of either LRRK2 kinase or NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2). Oxidative stress induced by the pesticide rotenone was ameliorated by LRRK2 kinase inhibition and was absent in cells devoid of LRRK2. In a rat model of PD induced by rotenone, a LRRK2 kinase inhibitor prevented the lipid peroxidation and NOX2 activation normally seen in nigral dopaminergic neurons in this model. Mechanistically, LRRK2 kinase activity was shown to regulate phosphorylation of serine-345 in the p47",

    "abstract": "Cognitive decline is a debilitating symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment in PD has a significant impact on many aspects of an individual's life, social interactions, and overall quality of life (QOL). It is also associated with a faster disease progression and an increased risk of developing dementia. A biopsychosocial approach is likely to address not only the underlying biological mechanisms of cognitive impairment in PD but also the psychological and social factors that can contribute to cognitive decline and influence treatment outcomes.\nThis experimental study was conducted on 60 older adults with PD at Saveetha medical college and hospital. Participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated into two groups of Biopsychosocial (n\u00a0=\u00a030) and conventional (n\u00a0=\u00a030). Participants in the intervention group received the multiple interventions based on the biopsychosocial approach with a duration of 60\u00a0min per session. Pre and post-test evaluation conducted using Scales for Outcomes in PD-cognition (SCOPA-cog) and Parkinson disease QOL Questionnaire (PDQ-8).\nThe results of the study showed that there is a statistically significant difference in the median scores within the Groups for the outcome measures SCOPA-cog and PDQ-8 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). For SCOPA-cog, the BPS group median score increased from 30 to 36, while the Conventional group median score increased from 31 to 33. For PDQ-8, the BPS group median reduced from 27 to 14, compared to the Conventional group's reduced from 30 to 24. On comparison between the post-test values, the biopsychosocial approach group showed more improvement in cognition and QOL with (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nThe findings of this study concluded that the biopsychosocial approach is effective in improving cognition and QOL among the Parkinson population.",

    "abstract": "Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), is a new technique for invasive brain stimulation and modulation that has emerged recently, but the effects in Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment (PD-CI) have been less observed. In this study, we collected 56 patients with PD-CI who were continuously treated with LIPUS for 8 weeks, and observed the clinical efficacy of LIPUS on PD-CI patients by comparing with the Sham stimulation continuous treatment.\nFifty-six PD-CI patients were divided into the Sham group (given Sham stimulation on top of conventional medication, n = 28) and the LIPUS group (given LIPUS stimulation on top of conventional medication, n = 28), and both groups continued treatment for 8 weeks. Post-treatment efficacy and pre- and post-treatment cognitive function [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)], emotional state [Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)], quality of life [Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39)], and serologic indices [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA)] were compared.\nThe total effective rate of the LIPUS group was higher versus that of the Sham group. In both groups, MMSE and MoCA scores increased; BDI and BAI scores decreased; UPDRS and PDQ-39 scores were reduced; the levels of 5-HT, NE, and DA were elevated. The above changes were more pronounced in the LIPUS group (all \nThe application of LIPUS on PD-CI could ameliorate patients' cognitive function, emotional state and quality of life, and regulate and optimize neurotransmitter expression levels.",

    "abstract": "Dance classes for people with Parkinson's Disease (PD) are offered worldwide; however, further studies are needed to explore patients' experiences of how dance affects well-being.\nTo explore how Dance for Parkinson (Dance for PD) is experienced, and how it contributes to the well-being and health of participants in Sweden.\nThis qualitative study collected data from four focus groups. Participants were asked how dance classes impacted their well-being, and their ability to perform activities of daily life. The focus groups were recorded and transcribed. Data were analysed using content analysis, meaning units were coded, and codes were coalesced into categories from which themes were abstracted.\nDance for PD provided a multifaceted experience related to social relationships, aesthetic context, feelings of wellbeing and the physical experience of dancing. The main theme contained four sub-themes: Connectedness, Pleasure and glamour, Well-being in mind and body and Customized movements.\nThe present study highlights that health and well-being are improved by Dance for PD. It is an enjoyable activity that meets the specific needs of persons living with the consequences of PD and should therefore be promoted by occupational therapists.",

    "abstract": "Nursing homes in the Caribbean are scarce and the characteristics of their residents have not been previously documented. This study aimed to describe the clinical profiles of residents living in nursing homes in Guadeloupe and Martinique (French West Indies).\nThis is a cross-sectional study of the baseline screening data from the KASEHPAD (Karukera Study of Ageing in nursing homes) study. Clinical characteristics and geriatric scale scores, including the Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mini Nutritional Assessment Short-Form (MNA-SF) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) were collected and analysed.\nA total of 332 older adults were recruited between September 2020 and November 2022. The mean age of the residents was 81.3\u2009\u00b1\u200910.1, with a male-female ratio of 1:1. Diabetes was reported in 28.3% of the residents, hypertension in 66.6% and heart disease in 18.4%. Dementia was diagnosed in 52.3% of the residents and 74.9% had a MMSE score \u226418. The prevalence of Parkinson's disease was 9.0%. Additionally, 18.4% were unable to perform any basic activities of daily living (ADL score of 0). The prevalence of physical impairment (SPPB\u2009<\u20098) was 90.0%. One-quarter of the residents were classified as undernourished (MNA-SF score\u2009\u2264\u20097).\nResidents in Caribbean nursing homes are younger than in metropolitan France, whereas they present quite similar clinical profiles. Notably, a high prevalence of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases was observed. This study represents a preliminary effort to address the knowledge gap regarding the aging trajectories of older adults in the Caribbean and could guide the development of future nursing homes in these countries.",

Inflammation/nutrition-based indicators were derived from a comprehensive set of parameters, including neutrophil-albumin ratio (NAR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), monocyte-albumin ratio (MAR), red cell distribution width-albumin ratio (RAR), hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet (HALP) score, advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI), geriatric nutrition risk index (GNRI), and controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score. PD status was determined based on self-reported anti-parkinsonian medication use. Mortality data were obtained from the National Death Index, linked up to December 30, 2019.\nAfter multivariate adjustment, all inflammation/nutrition-based indicators showed significant associations with all-cause mortality among adult participants. The random survival forest emphasized the importance of inflammation/nutrition-based indicators and their components in predicting mortality, with PNI and RAR being the most important indicators for predicting all-cause mortality. Individuals with PD have a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to those without PD (HR = 1.747 [1.363-2.238], \nInflammation and nutrition status play crucial roles in predicting all-cause mortality among adults, particularly in the context of PD. The study underscores the importance of considering both factors in mortality risk assessment and provides valuable insights for future research and clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Current treatments of Parkinson's disease (PD) have limited efficacy in alleviating freezing of gait (FoG). In this context, concomitant deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) has been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach. However, the mechanisms underlying this approach are unknown. While the current rationale relies on network-based hypotheses of intensified disinhibition of brainstem locomotor areas to facilitate the release of gait motor programs, it is still unclear how simultaneous high-frequency DBS in two interconnected basal ganglia nuclei affects large-scale cortico-subcortical network activity. Here, we use a basic model of neural excitation, the susceptible-excited-refractory (SER) model, to compare effects of different stimulation modes of the network underlying FoG based on the mouse brain connectivity atlas. We develop a network-based computational framework to compare subcortical DBS targets through exhaustive analysis of the brain attractor dynamics in the healthy, PD, and DBS states. We show that combined STN+SNr DBS outperforms STN DBS in terms of the normalization of spike propagation flow in the FoG network. The framework aims to move toward a mechanistic understanding of the network effects of DBS and may be applicable to further perturbation-based therapies of brain disorders.\nParkinson\u2019s disease patients with freezing of gait (FoG) may be treated by deep brain stimulation, which produces effects mediated by brain networks. Currently, the approach of combined DBS of the subthalamic nucleus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata is investigated for being particularly beneficial for patients with axial symptoms, but the exact mechanisms of this effect are unknown. Here, we present a network-based computational framework using a basic excitable model that enables us to simulate the complete activity patterns of the brain network involved in FoG. These simulations reveal network mechanisms underlying STN+SNr DBS and its efficacy in alleviating FoG. The proposed framework can capture the influence of the DBS target sites on cortico-subcortical networks and help to identify suitable stimulation targets.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a prevalent non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which can result in significant disability and distress for patients and caregivers. There is a marked variation in the timing, characteristics and rate at which cognitive decline occurs in patients with PD. This decline can vary from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Cognitive impairment is associated with several pathophysiological mechanisms, including the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid and tau in the brain, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunctions are commonly observed in patients with PD. These dysfunctions play a role in the progression of cognitive impairment, the incidents of falls and even in mortality. The majority of symptoms of dysautonomia arise from changes in the peripheral autonomic nervous system, including both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Cardiovascular changes, including orthostatic hypotension, supine hypertension and abnormal nocturnal blood pressure (BP), can occur in both the early and advanced stages of PD. These changes tend to increase as the disease advances. The present review aimed to describe the cognitive changes in the setting of cardiovascular dysautonomia and to discuss strategies through which these changes can be modified and managed. It is a multifactorial process usually involving decreased blood flow to the brain, resulting in the development of cerebral ischemic lesions, an increased presence of abnormal white matter signals in the brain, and a potential influence on the process of neurodegeneration in PD. Another possible explanation is this association being independent observations of PD progression. Patients with clinical symptoms of dysautonomia should undergo 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, as they are frequently subtle and underdiagnosed.",

    "abstract": "Psychosis and visual hallucinations are a prevalent non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease, negatively affecting patients' quality of life and constituting a greater risk for dementia. Understanding neural mechanisms associated to these symptoms is instrumental for treatment development. The mismatch negativity is an event-related potential evoked by a violation in a sequence of sensory events. It is widely considered an index of sensory change-detection. Reduced mismatch negativity response is one of the most replicated results in schizophrenia and has been suggested to be a superior psychosis marker. To understand whether this event-related potential component could be a similarly robust marker for Parkinson's psychosis, we used electroencephalography with a change-detection task to study the mismatch negativity in the visual modality in 20 participants with Parkinson's and visual hallucinations and 18 matched Parkinson's participants without hallucinations. We find that visual mismatch negativity is clearly present in participants with Parkinson's disease without hallucinations at both parieto-occipital and frontal sites, whereas participants with Parkinson's and visual hallucinations show reduced or no differences in the two waveforms, confirming the sensitivity of mismatch negativity to psychosis, even within the same diagnostic group. We also explored the relationship between hallucination severity and visual mismatch negativity amplitude, finding a negative correlation between visual hallucinations severity scores and visual mismatch negativity amplitude at a central frontal and a parieto-occipital electrodes, whereby the more severe or complex (illusions, formed visual hallucinations) the symptoms the smaller the amplitude. We have also tested the potential role of the serotonergic 5-HT",

    "abstract": "[Purpose] One-leg standing motion was measured in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) to evaluate the association between freezing of gait (FOG) and anticipatory postural adjustments (APA). [Participants and Methods] The participants included10 healthy older individuals, seven patients with PD without FOG (PD-FOG group), and seven patients with PD and FOG (PD+FOG group). An accelerometer that was built into a smartphone was attached to the lower back of each participant, and acceleration in the mediolateral direction was measured during one-leg standing. For the mediolateral component of acceleration, the time to the maximum value in the stance direction (peak latency, PL) and the amount of displacement of the maximum value (peak magnitude, PM) were analyzed as APA features. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare PL and PM among the three groups. In addition, the APA ratio (APAr), which is the ratio of PL to PM, was compared between study cohorts. [Results] Delayed PL and decreased PM were observed in the PD+FOG group, compared with the older and PD-FOG groups. In addition, APAr levels were significantly lower in the PD+FOG group. [Conclusion] Patients with PD with FOG had greater APA impairment than those with PD without FOG.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a combination of aging, environmental, and genetic factors. Previous research has implicated both causative and susceptibility genes in PD development. Nogo-A, a neurite outgrowth inhibitor, has been shown to impact axon growth through ligand-receptor interactions negatively, thereby involved in the deterioration of dopaminergic neurons. However, rare genetic studies have identified the relationship between neurite outgrowth inhibitor (Nogo)-associated genes and PD from a signaling pathway perspective.\nWe enrolled 3959 PD patients and 2931 healthy controls, categorized into two cohorts based on their family history and age at onset: sporadic early Parkinson's disease & familial Parkinson's disease (sEOPD & FPD) cohort and sporadic late Parkinson's disease (sLOPD) cohort. We selected 17 Nogo-associated genes and stratified them into three groups via their function, respectively, ligand, receptors, and signaling pathway groups. Additionally, we conducted the burden analysis in rare variants, the logistic regression analysis in common variants, and the genotype-phenotype association analysis. Last, bioinformatics analysis and functional experiments were conducted to identify the role of the MTOR gene in PD.\nOur findings demonstrated that the missense variants in the MTOR gene might increase PD risk, while the deleterious variants in the receptor subtype of Nogo-associated genes might mitigate PD risk. However, common variants of Nogo-associated genes showed no association with PD development in two cohorts. Furthermore, genotype-phenotype association analysis suggested that PD patients with MTOR gene variants exhibited relatively milder motor symptoms but were more susceptible developing dyskinesia. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis results showed MTOR gene was significantly decreased in PD, indicating a potential negative role of the mTOR in PD pathogenesis. Experimental data further demonstrated that MHY1485, a mTOR agonist, could rescue MPP\nOur preliminary investigation highlights the association of Nogo-associated genes with PD onset in the Chinese mainland population and hints at the potential role of the MTOR gene in PD. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanistic pathways underlying these associations and their therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive disorder worldwide and its etiology remains unidentified. Over the last few decades, animal models of PD have been extensively utilized to explore the development and mechanisms of this neurodegenerative condition. Toxic and transgenic animal models for PD possess unique characteristics and constraints, necessitating careful consideration when selecting the appropriate model for research purposes. Animal models have played a significant role in uncovering the causes and development of PD, including its cellular and molecular processes. These models suggest that the disorder arises from intricate interplays between genetic predispositions and environmental influences. Every model possesses its unique set of strengths and weaknesses. This review provides a critical examination of animal models for PD and compares them with the features observed in the human manifestation of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Improving health-related quality of life (QoL) is crucial for managing Parkinson's disease. However, QoL outcomes after deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) vary considerably. Current approaches lack integration of demographic, patient-reported, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological data to understand this variability. This study used explainable machine learning to analyze multimodal factors affecting QoL changes, measured by the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) in 63 patients, and quantified each variable's contribution. Results showed that preoperative PDQ-39 scores and upper beta band activity (>20\u2009Hz) in the left STN were key predictors of QoL changes. Lower initial QoL burden predicted worsening, while improvement was associated with higher beta activity. Additionally, electrode positions along the superior-inferior axis, especially relative to the z\u2009=\u2009-7 coordinate in standard space, influenced outcomes, with improved and worsened QoL above and below this marker. This study emphasizes a tailored, data-informed approach to optimize DBS treatment and improve patient QoL.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection poses a significant public health challenge and often leads to long-term health complications and even death. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a proposed viral etiology. HCV infection and PD have been previously suggested to be related. This work aimed to identify potential biomarkers and pathways that may play a role in the joint development of PD and HCV infection. Using BioOptimatics-bioinformatics driven by mathematical global optimization-, 22 publicly available microarray and RNAseq datasets for both diseases were analyzed, focusing on sex-specific differences. Our results revealed that 19 genes, including MT1H, MYOM2, and RPL18, exhibited significant changes in expression in both diseases. Pathway and network analyses stratified by sex indicated that these gene expression changes were enriched in processes related to immune response regulation in females and immune cell activation in males. These findings suggest a potential link between HCV infection and PD, highlighting the importance of further investigation into the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets involved.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia are subcortical brain structures involved in motor control, cognition, and emotion regulation. We conducted univariate and multivariate genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) to explore the genetic architecture of basal ganglia volumes using brain scans obtained from 34,794 Europeans with replication in 4,808 white and generalization in 5,220 non-white Europeans. Our multivariate GWAS identified 72 genetic loci associated with basal ganglia volumes with a replication rate of 55.6% at P\u2009<\u20090.05 and 87.5% showed the same direction, revealing a distributed genetic architecture across basal ganglia structures. Of these, 50 loci were novel, including exonic regions of APOE, NBR1 and HLAA. We examined the genetic overlap between basal ganglia volumes and several neurological and psychiatric disorders. The strongest genetic overlap was between basal ganglia and Parkinson's disease, as supported by robust LD-score regression-based genetic correlations. Mendelian randomization indicated genetic liability to larger striatal volume as potentially causal for Parkinson's disease, in addition to a suggestive causal effect of greater genetic liability to Alzheimer's disease on smaller accumbens. Functional analyses implicated neurogenesis, neuron differentiation and development in basal ganglia volumes. These results enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture and molecular associations of basal ganglia structure and their role in brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a clinically diagnosed disease that carries a reported misdiagnosis rate of 10-20%. Recent scientific discoveries have provided evidence of volatile organic compounds in sebum that are unique to patients with PD. The primary objective of this study was to determine if companion dogs could be trained to distinguish between sebum samples provided by PD-positive patients and PD-negative human controls. This was a randomized, handler-blind, controlled study. Twenty-three canines of varying breeds, ages, and environmental backgrounds were included. The study period encompassed 200 total working days from 2021 to 2022. Factors investigated included donor gender and levodopa drug affectivity, as well as canine breed, age, and duration of training time. The findings in this study were compiled from data collected during the final two years of a seven-year research program. For this two-year reporting period, when averaged as a group, the 23 dogs were 89% sensitive and 87% specific to olfactory distinction between PD-positive and PD-negative human donor samples. Ten of the twenty-three dogs averaged 90% or higher in both sensitivity and specificity. In 161 separate trials, a dog was presented with both novel PD-positive and PD-negative samples. For these novel exposures, the dogs collectively averaged 86% sensitivity and 89% specificity. PD medication was also investigated and was found to have no discernible impact on canine sensitivity or specificity results. Study findings support the application of companion dogs, trained with force-free, reward-based methodologies, for the detection of PD-positive and PD-negative samples under controlled conditions.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the influence of preoperative cognition on postoperative motor and nonmotor outcomes in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) after deep brain stimulation (DBS).\nA retrospective study was performed in subjects with PD with bilateral subthalamic DBS. Preoperative cognition was indexed by Parkinson's Disease-Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS) and global neuropsychological evaluation (NPE) scores. The primary outcome was change from baseline to postoperative off-drug Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part 3 score. Secondary outcomes included change from baseline to postoperative MDS-UPDRS part 1 subscores.\nThe study included 226 subjects; 176 patients (77.9%) had normal cognition (PD-NC); 48 (21.2%) had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and two (0.9%) had PD dementia. Proportional change (-41.4% vs\u00a0-52.2%, p\u00a0= 0.013) in off-drug MDS-UPDRS part 3 score was smaller in PD-MCI than in PD-NC. PD-CRS (Pearson's r\u00a0= 0.236, p\u00a0< 0.001) and NPE (Pearson's r\u00a0= 0.219, p\u00a0< 0.001) scores displayed a positive correlation with proportional change in off-drug MDS-UPDRS part 3 score. Worse PD-CRS scores were related to larger improvements in MDS-UPDRS part 1.2 (hallucinations) (Pearson's r\u00a0= 0.135, p\u00a0= 0.045).\nDBS induces a clinically meaningful motor improvement in patients with cognitive impairment and PD, but the improvement may be smaller than in patients who are not cognitively affected. Further research into the risk-benefit balance of DBS in people with PD and cognitive dysfunction is warranted.",

    "abstract": "<p>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder and the second most common neu&shy;rodegenerative disease of the central ner&shy;vous system. Dizziness is frequently reported by PD patients, yet there is a paucity of research focusing on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in this population using high-frequency vestibular testing. This study aims to investigate the VOR in individuals with PD using the video head thrust test with and without suppression.&nbsp;</p>.\n<p>Forty individuals with PD and 40 healthy individuals were included in the study. According to the Hoehn-Yahr Scale, individuals with PD were defined as early stage with a score of 1&ndash;2.5 and middle to late stage with a score of 3 to 5. The Head Impulse Testing Paradigm (HIMP) and Suppression Head Impulse Testing Paradigm (SHIMP) were applied to all individuals.</p>.\n<p>No statistically significant difference was observed between the PD group and the control group in terms of semicircular canal (SCC) gains in both HIMP and SHIMP tests. No catch-up saccades were observed in the right anterior, right posterior, left anterior, and left posterior SCC planes in the PD and control groups. However, in the right lateral SCC plane 32 patients in the PD group had saccades, while 8 patients in the control group had saccades. In the left lateral SCC plane, 32 patients in the PD group and 9 patients in the control group had catch-up saccades. A statistically significant difference was observed in the number and amplitude of saccades in the right and left lateral SCC planes compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). In addition, in the PD group, the amplitude, peak velocity, and latency of the anticompensatory saccades seen in SHIMP showed a statistically significant difference compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05).</p>.\n<p>VOR in the vertical SCC plane was not affected in individuals with PD. However, VOR in the lateral SCC plane was affected. It was concluded that when evaluating VOR with both HIMP and SHIMP in individuals with PD, the presence of catch-up saccades should be focused on and evaluated for possible vestibular dysfunction, even though SCC gains are normal.

    "abstract": "Patients who have Parkinson's disease (PD) present several non-motor issues, such as sexual dysfunction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a great treatment for PD and could affect both motor and non-motor symptoms of patients.\nThe main goal of the current study is to evaluate the impact of DBS on the sexual dysfunction among patients with PD.\nFive databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) were searched for records. Studies that measured the effect of DBS sexual function were included. The risk of bias assessment tool of non-randomized studies of interventions (ROBINS-I) was used to assess the quality of the included studies. The before and after data extraction and statistical analysis were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-analysis software (CMA) version 3.0.\nTen studies were included in the systematic review; six of them were eligible to perform a meta-analysis with a total sample size of 532 participants and a mean age of 62.21\u2009\u00b1\u20091.59\u2009years. All participants performed STN-DBS. The sexual function of participants after STN-DBS implantation significantly increased (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.124, 95% CI: -0.209 to -0.038, \nOur systematic review highlights the potential effect of STN-DBS on reducing the sexual dysfunction of patients with PD and boosting their quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting the elderly. Relevant studies suggest a significant connection between the mitochondria and PD. Publications exploring this connection have steadily increased in recent years. This study employs a bibliometric approach to comprehensively analyze the current status and future directions of the research on mitochondria and PD.\nWe retrieved data from the Web of Science database and used CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and \"Bibliometrix\" software to visually analyze various aspects of the research field. These aspects included the number of published papers, contributing countries and institutions, authors, publishing journals, cited references, and keywords.\nOur analysis identified a total of 3,291 publications involving 14,670 authors from 2,836 organizations across 78 countries. The publication volume exhibited a continuous upward trend from 1999 to 2023. The United States emerged as the leading force in this research area, contributing the highest number of high-quality publications. Notably, the United States collaborated extensively with Germany and the United Kingdom. The University of Pittsburgh stood out as the most prolific institution. Harvard University had the highest academic influence and closely cooperated with the University of Pittsburgh, Juntendo University, and McGill University. Dr. Hattori Nobutaka was identified as the most prolific author, while Dr. Youle, Richard J emerged as the most influential author based on the highest average citation frequency. The \nMitochondria-PD research is experiencing a steady increase in activity, fueled by increasing close collaboration between countries and different institutions. However, there is a need to further strengthen collaboration and communication between developed and developing nations. Current research has focused on the specific mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction and their relationship with PD.

In order to demonstrate TE's anticonvulsant activity a zebrafish model was used. The study also assessed TE's toxicity and antioxidant activity. To standardize the extract, total polyphenols and flavonoids were quantified and specific flavonoids were identified and quantified using HPLC-MS/MS and HPLC-UV.\nTE exhibited anticonvulsant activity at low concentrations and demonstrated antioxidant effects by scavenging free radicals, exhibiting superoxide dismutase and peroxidase-like activities, as well as inhibiting lipoperoxidation. These actions can be attributed to the presence of polyphenols, particularly flavonoids.\nTE holds promise as a complementary herbal medicine in the treatment of epilepsy and may also offer benefits for other neuropathies associated with oxidative stress, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the PRKN gene encoding the protein parkin cause autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (ARJP). Harnessing this mutation to create an early-onset Parkinson's disease mouse model would provide a unique opportunity to clarify the mechanisms involved in the neurodegenerative process and lay the groundwork for the development of neuroprotective strategies. To this end, we created a knock-in mouse carrying the homozygous PrknR275W mutation, which is the missense mutation with the highest allelic frequency in PRKN patients. We evaluated the anatomical and functional integrity of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) pathway, as well as motor behaviour in PrknR275W mice of both sexes. We report here that PrknR275W mice show early DA neuron dysfunction, age-dependent loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra, decreased DA content and stimulus-evoked DA release in the striatum, and progressive motor impairment. Together, these data show that the PrknR275W mouse recapitulates key features of ARJP. Thus, these studies fill a critical need in the field by introducing a promising new Parkinson's disease model in which to study causative mechanisms of the disease and test therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurological condition caused due to inheritance, environment, and behavior among various other parameters. The onset, diagnosis, course of therapy, and future of PD are thoroughly examined in this comprehensive review. This review also insights into pathogenic mechanisms of reactive microgliosis, Lewy bodies, and their functions in the evolution of PD. It addresses interaction complexity with genetic mutations, especially in genes such as UCH-L1, parkin, and \u03b1-synuclein, which illuminates changes in the manner dopaminergic cells handle proteins and use proteases. One of the emerging therapeutic routes that are being investigated is neuroprotective medicines that aim to prevent the aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein and interventions that modify the progression of diseases. The review concludes by stressing the dynamic nature of PD research and the potential game-changing impact of precision medicines on current approaches to therapy. This raises the improved outcomes and life quality for those with PD. Potential treatments for severe PD include new surgical methods like Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). Further, exploration of non-motor manifestations, such as cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, and others, is covered in this review article. These symptoms have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. One of the emerging therapeutic routes that are being investigated is neuroprotective medicines that aim to prevent the aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein and interventions that modify the progression of diseases.
