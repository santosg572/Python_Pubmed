    "abstract": "Scoliosis treatment guidelines for non-operative management suggest that patients should be followed for two years beyond skeletal maturity to appropriately evaluate treatment effect. This report outlines the results of identical twin girls' treatment with chiropractic rehabilitation treatment at two years post skeletal maturity.\nThe twins participated in a treatment lasting two weeks, followed by home care maintenance and periodic follow-ups for they reached skeletal maturity. Two year follow up showed reduced Cobb angles of 19\u00b0 and 15\u00b0, respectively.\nIdentical twin girls who were evaluated two years after skeletal maturity showed clinically significant improvements in Cobb angle measurements. Controlled, prospective study design for future patients treated in this manner will provide greater insight into how the treatment may have impacted the observed changes.",

    "abstract": "Homeopathy claims a curative reaction from small doses of a substance, high doses of which cause symptoms similar to those the patient is suffering from. Hormesis is a concept of biphasic dose-response to different pharmacological and toxicological agents. According to this concept, a small dose of a noxious agent can exert a beneficial action. A hypothesis is defended here that hormesis as a general principle can be assumed only for the factors present in the natural environment thus having induced adaptation of living organisms. Generalizations of the hormesis phenomenon used in support of homeopathy are unfounded. Low-dose impacts may be associated with a higher risk in a state of organ sub-compensation or failure especially in the elderly patients. Practical recommendations should be based neither on the hormesis as a default approach nor on the postulates of homeopathy. All clinically relevant effects, hormetic or not, should be tested by the methods of evidence-based medicine.",

We report a case of monozygotic twins 37 years old men with occasional evidence of bullous emphysema with previously undiagnosed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV.

    "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most frequent primary malignant bone tumor, if we exclude myeloma, a hematologic systemic disease. OS is relatively uncommon, with an estimated incidence of 600 cases per year in the United States. Among siblings is an even rarer phenomenon, with scattered reports throughout the English literature(1). We report the incidence of OS in identical twins. The first case is a low-grade OS arisen in the proximal tibia of a 25-year-old man, treated with en-bloc resection and reconstruction with allograft. The second one is a high-grade OS of the distal tibia of the 33-year-old twin, developed in a previous non-ossifying fibroma (NOF) followed over the time. The patient was treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, en-bloc resection and reconstruction with allograft. Our literature review did not find any case of OS in identical twins, while 26 reports of OS in siblings are described.",

IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in the cord venous blood were quantified by radioimmunoassay. Birth weights (BWs) were obtained electronically. Placentas were examined for chorionicity.\nCord blood was collected in 37 pairs of MCT (15 pairs were males). BWs ranged from 564 to 3240 g, and gestational ages (GAs) were between 24 weeks and 39 weeks. There was a correlation between BW and cord venous blood IGFBP-3 concentration (r = 0.28, p = 0.015), but not between BW and cord venous blood IGF-1 level. There was no difference in IGF-1 between the heavier twins (30.8 \u00b1 61.8 ng/mL) and lighter twins (33.2 \u00b1 63.7 ng/mL), but a trend (p = 0.096) of higher IGFBP-3 level was demonstrated in heavier twins (3.14 \u00b1 1.23 \u03bcg/mL) than in lighter twins (2.71 \u00b1 1.19 \u03bcg/mL). The IGFBP-3 levels were higher (p = 0.042) in female twins (3.20 \u00b1 1.33 \u03bcg/mL) than in male twins (2.64 \u00b1 1.04 \u03bcg/mL). The IGF-1 level of the heavier twins correlated significantly to their lighter co-twin (r = 0.73, p < 0.001).\nOur data showed that cord venous blood IGF-1 level might be controlled mainly by genetic factors.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to report a successful twin pregnancy and delivery in a female patient with X-linked dominant incontinentia pigmenti (IP) who underwent assisted reproductive technology followed by preimplantation genetic screening (PGS). A 29-year-old female with IP had a previous history of recurrent spontaneous abortion. A molecular analysis revealed the patient had a de novo mutation, 1308_1309insCCCCTTG(p.Ala438ProfsTer26), in the inhibitor of the kappa B kinase gamma gene located in the Xq28 region. IVF/ICSI and PGS was performed, in which male embryos were sexed using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). After IVF/ICSI and PGS using aCGH on seven embryos, two euploid male blastocysts were transferred with a 50% probability of a viable male pregnancy. The dizygotic twin pregnancy was confirmed and the amniocentesis results of each twin were normal with regard to the mutation found in the mother. The patient delivered healthy twin babies during the 37th week of gestation. This case shows the beneficial role of PGS in achieving a successful pregnancy through euploid male embryo gender selection in a woman with X-linked dominant IP with a history of multiple male miscarriages.",

    "abstract": "Inclusion body myopathy, Paget disease of bone and/or frontotemporal dementia is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the Valosin Containing Protein (VCP) gene. We compared clinical findings including MRI images and neuropsychological assessment data in affected and unaffected twin brothers aged 56\u2009years from a family with the p.R155C VCP gene mutation. The affected twin presented with a 10 year history of progressive proximal muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing, gastroesophageal reflux, fecal incontinence, and peripheral neuropathy. Comprehensive neuropsychological testing revealed rapid cognitive decline in the absence of any behavioral changes in a span of 1 year. This case illustrates that frontotemporal dementia related cognitive impairment may precede behavioral changes in VCP disease as compared with predominance of behavioral impairment reported in previous studies. Our findings suggest that there is a need to establish VCP disease specific tools and normative rates of decline to detect pre-clinical cognitive impairment among affected individuals.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a key factor in the pathogenesis of intra-uterine growth restriction in singleton. However, its role in selective intra-uterine growth restriction (sIUGR) in monochorionic twins (MCT) is still unknown. This study explored the characteristics of oxidative stresses in the placenta shares of MCT and analyzed their possible connections with sIUGR.\nThe placental levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 gene (HIF1A)mRNA, malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were evaluated in normal MCT (Group A) and sIUGR MCT (Group B). The results were compared between the placental shares of the larger twins (A1/B1) and smaller twins (A2/B2).\nPlacental HIF1A mRNA level significantly increased in Group B. Particularly, HIF1A mRNA level was elevated in the placenta share of the growth-restricted fetus (B2) than the co-twin (B1) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.036). More discordant HIF1A mRNA level was detected in Group B than Group A with larger inter-twin difference (P\u00a0=\u00a00.021). The levels of MDA and 8-OHdG were significantly higher in B2 than B1 in sIUGR MCT (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Both the inter-twin differences of MDA and 8-OHdG were also significantly larger in Group B (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), indicating that discordant oxidative stress existed in the placental shares of sIUGR pregnancies. Finally, MDA concentration was found inversely correlated with neonatal birth weight, in both sIUGR (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.650, P\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and normal MCT (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.632, P\u00a0=\u00a00.027) pregnancies.\nThe elevation of HIF1A mRNA, and MDA/8-OHdG levels in placenta shares of sIUGR MCT suggests that oxidative stress may be involved in the pathogenesis of sIUGR.",

    "abstract": "To review the outcomes of perinatal management of twins with discordant congenital defects.\nWe retrospectively examined the cases of twins with discordant congenital defects treated in the West China Second University Hospital from December 2011 to December 2013.\nThere were 26 cases of twins (14 dichorionic and 12 monochorionic) with one anomalous fetus. Of those twins, 16 were conceived by nature and 10 by in vitro fertilization and embryo tansfer (IVF-ET). Counselling services were offered to the parents by a multidisciplinary team about options of pregnancy. Termination of pregnancy was chosen on three monochorionic twins. Twelve pairs of twin were delivered at 26(+3)-37(+6) weeks gestation. One pair ended with neonatal death, and another one with gastroschisis was given intrapartum fetal operation. Selective termination was chosen on 11 cases using intracardiac injection of potassium chloride under ultrasonographic guidance (9 cases) or bipolar cord coagulation (2 cases). This resulted in ten live births delivered at 25(+5)-38(+4) gustation and one neonatal death.\nEarly diagnosis of twins with discordant congenital defects is important. Multidisciplinary counselling services to parents are recommended for determination of options. Intensive prenatal care is essential in management of twins with discordant congenital defects.",

An apparently female conjoined twin lambs was examined based on external and internal features. In radiology, two vertebral columns and two pairs of the ribs were seen. Only two heads and two necks were separated (thoraco-omphalopygopagus). There were three forelimbs (tribrachius), one of which grew on dorsal region as a notomelus. Teat buds of the monsters differed in number. Only one lamb had umbilicus, including one umbilical vein, and two umbilical arteries locating besides one urinary bladder. This lamb had also one uterus. Two-separated alimentary tracts were observed in a common abdomen. Common thorax and abdominal cavities were separated by a diaphragm. There were two esophageal hiatuses, and two caval foramina but only one aortic hiatus. Two pairs of lungs and two unequal and connected hearts in a common pericardium were observed. Abnormality of the circulatory system might have caused the death of the twins.",

    "abstract": "Twins are two independent babies delivered during the same pregnancy and are divided as monozygotic or dizygotic based on their origin. Dizygotic twins are similar to two siblings and have different genetic information. In contrary, monozygotic twins have a similar genetic identity and provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the contribution of genetic and environmental factors of the disease. The endocrine and metabolic disorders affect a large number of the population including the twins. Diabetes, obesity, and autoimmune thyroid disease are the most common endocrine disorders in general practice. It is essential to understand the genetic basis of endocrine disorders for therapy, prognostication and risk assessment for future generations. In this article, we review the endocrine disorders in relation to their occurrence in monozygotic twins to highlight the genetic and environmental contribution.",

The presented case of developing turkey twin embryos is the first ever described case for this species. The egg weighed 125 g and had 74.6 mm in length and 53.0 mm in width. The embryos died between the 23rd and 24th day of incubation. Both twin 1 and twin 2 were fully developed with body weights of: 37.7 g and 40.3 g, respectively. The likely causes of death include inappropriate arrangement of embryos and insufficient gas exchange in the last period of incubation. The embryos were arranged along the long axis of the egg, one underneath the other, and were closely adhering to one another. The twins were different in plumage pigmentation. In twin 1, a spontaneous mutation of plumage pigmentation (B) was observed, whereas twin 2 showed appropriate pigmentation (b+) in respect to parents.",

    "abstract": "We report the case of Niemann-Pick disease type C with extensive phenotypic heterogeneity in two monozygotic twins. One of the twins presented with a history of obsessive-compulsive disorder and slowly progressive inferior limb clumsiness, dysphagia and dysarthria. Neurological examination revealed a broad-based ataxic gait, limb dysmetria, downward vertical gaze palsy, brisk lower limb reflexes and ankle clonus, while neuropsychological assessment revealed global cognitive deficits in multiple domains. Complete neurological and neuropsychological evaluation in the asymptomatic monozygotic twin brother only revealed mild neurological impairment. In the hypothesis of Niemann-Pick disease type C, Filipin test, measurement of plasma oxysterols levels and genetic analysis were carried out in both twins. Filipin staining showed massive intracellular accumulation of non-esterified cholesterol, plasma oxysterols levels were elevated and genetic analysis revealed a homozygous c.2662 C\u00a0>\u00a0T (p.P888S) mutation in the NPC1 gene (18q11.2) in both twins. 18F-FDG-PET imaging with single-subject analysis revealed a reduced frontal and temporal glucose metabolism, which correlated with disease progression. This case supports the phenotypic variability of Mendelian inherited disorders in monozygotic twins, likely due to epigenetic differences and post-zygotic mutagenesis.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive immune responses in humans rely on somatic genetic rearrangements of Ig and T-cell receptor loci to generate diverse antigen receptors. It is unclear to what extent an individual's genetic background affects the characteristics of the antibody repertoire used in responding to vaccination or infection. We studied the B-cell repertoires and clonal expansions in response to attenuated varicella-zoster vaccination in four pairs of adult identical twins and found that the global antibody repertoires of twin pair members showed high similarity in antibody heavy chain V, D, and J gene segment use, and in the length and features of the complementarity-determining region 3, a major determinant of antigen binding. These twin similarities were most pronounced in the IgM-expressing B-cell pools, but were seen to a lesser extent in IgG-expressing B cells. In addition, the degree of antibody somatic mutation accumulated in the B-cell repertoire was highly correlated within twin pair members. Twin pair members had greater numbers of shared convergent antibody sequences, including mutated sequences, suggesting similarity among memory B-cell clonal lineages. Despite these similarities in the memory repertoire, the B-cell clones used in acute responses to ZOSTAVAX vaccination were largely unique to each individual. Taken together, these results suggest that the overall B-cell repertoire is significantly shaped by the underlying germ-line genome, but that stochastic or individual-specific effects dominate the selection of clones in response to an acute antigenic stimulus.",

    "abstract": "Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure (PP), and body mass index (BMI) are heritable traits in human metabolic health but their common genetic and environmental backgrounds are not well investigated. The aim of this article was to explore the phenotypic and genetic associations among PP, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and BMI. The studied sample contained 615 twin pairs (17-84 years) collected in the Qingdao municipality. Univariate and multivariate structural equation models were fitted for assessing the genetic and environmental contributions. The AE model combining additive genetic (A) and unique environmental (E) factors produced the best fit for each four phenotypes. Heritability estimated in univariate analysis ranged from 0.42 to 0.74 with the highest for BMI (95% CI 0.70-0.78), and the lowest for PP (95% CI 0.34-0.49). The multivariate model estimated (1) high genetic correlations for DBP with SBP (0.87), PP with SBP (0.75); (2) low-moderate genetic correlations between PP and DBP (0.32), each BP component and BMI (0.24-0.37); (3) moderate unique environmental correlation for PP with SBP (0.68) and SBP with DBP (0.63); (4) there was no significant unique environmental correlation between PP and BMI. Overall, our multivariate analyses revealed common genetic and environmental backgrounds for PP, BP, and BMI in Chinese twins.",

    "abstract": "Plasma homocysteine (Hcy) is a modifiable, independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is affected by both environmental and genetic factors. This study aimed to describe the gender- and age-specific distribution of Hcy concentration for 1117 subjects aged 10-66 years, a subset of a community-based rural Chinese twin cohort. In addition, we examined environmental and genetic contributions to variances in Hcy concentration by gender and age groups. We found that the distribution pattern for Hcy varied by both age and gender. Males had higher Hcy than females across all ages. Elevated Hcy was found in 43% of male adults and 13% of female adults. Moreover, nearly one fifth of children had elevated Hcy. Genetic factors could explain 52%, 36% and 69% of the variation in Hcy concentration among children, male adults and female adults, respectively. The MTHFR C677T variant was significantly associated with Hcy concentrations. Smokers with the TT genotype had the highest Hcy levels. Overall, our results indicate that elevated Hcy is prevalent in the children and adults in this rural Chinese population. The early identification of elevated Hcy will offer a window of opportunity for the primary prevention of CVD and metabolic syndrome.",

The affected, the father and his twin offspring, all exhibit the typical facial features, signs and symptoms consistent with the syndromic phenotype. A distinct phenotypic variability is nevertheless noted although they all share the same deletion.\nThese three patients are to our knowledge the first described cases of 15q24 syndrome in the same family. Urogenital malformations have previously been described as a part of this syndrome. Our adult male patient exhibits no such malformations but has a documented reduced fertility. This fact points to other factors such as haploinsufficiency of one and/or further genes on 15q24 as being responsible for the infertility. Array analysis could be considered as a first hand analysis in the investigation of cases of infertility and intellectual deficiency in adults in analogy to the existing consensus regarding cases of intellectual deficiency in children.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric erythroderma is a severe cutaneous disorder, which may pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Psoriasis, ichthyoses, atopy, seborrhoeic dermatitis, pityriasis rubra pilaris, infections, metabolic diseases, drugs reaction, may cause erythroderma. The therapy should be tailored on each aetiology, if possible. The biochemical and metabolic imbalance should be corrected, and particular attention should be paid to the psychosocial behavior often related to this disfiguring disease.\nTwo 3 year-old Caucasian twins have been suffering from an unmanageable erythroderma since the age of 8 months. The diagnosis of psoriasis, already remarkably expressed in the father's family in three cases of fraternal twins, could be enforced for several points. Major histocompatibility complex, class I, Cw*06 was detected in both twins; we found no transglutaminase-1, no corneodesmosin, nor any Interleukin-36 receptor antagonist gene mutations. We performed a cutaneous histology, positive immunostaining for Lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor, dermoscopy and reflectance confocal microscopy. The twins had previously received systemic steroids, short cycles of low-dosage ciclosporine, followed by etanercept at the dosage of 0,8 mg/kg, without reliable results. Cyclosporine was then reconsidered at a dosage of 5 mg/kg/day with close blood monitoring. After three months of treatment, consistent clearing and significant improvement of their social and psychological behaviour were achieved. After over one year of continuous therapy with cyclosporine, the twins have still maintained the result obtained.\nPediatric erythroderma may pose a great challenge as a potentially life-threatening condition causing extreme distress in children, parents and pediatricians. In young patients it is mandatory to establish correct clinical and instrumental procedures, possibly supplemented by genetic analyses such as those we required, in order to determine an effective and safe therapy in terms of cost-benefit and put patients and family in the best condition to perform common daily activities.",

    "abstract": "Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete penetrance and variable expression caused by germline mutation of serine threonine kinase 11/liver kinase B1; it is characterized by hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, mucocutaneous melanin pigmentation, and increased predisposition to neoplasms. In Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, bilateral Sertoli cell testicular tumors cause endocrine manifestations including gynecomastia and feminization. This study aimed to assess the role of breast ultrasound in the evaluation of the effectiveness of an innovative surgical approach.\nThis report presents a pair of European 9-year-old identical male twins with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, bilateral prepubertal gynecomastia, and testicular multifocal calcifications. Both twins were treated with anastrozole for 2 years. After finishing treatment, both underwent subcutaneous mastectomy performed by the \"modified\" Webster technique. Breast examination and ultrasound were performed before and after the pharmacological and surgical treatment. A breast ultrasound scan before surgery showed bilateral gynecomastia in both patients. No solid nodular or cystic formations were present on either side. After pharmacological therapy and surgical glandular removal, a breast examination showed a significant reduction in breast volume; 1 year after surgery, a breast ultrasound scan of both patients showed a total absence of glandular parenchyma, with muscle planes well represented.\nBreast examination and ultrasound have proved to be a valid approach in the assessment of the treatment of prepubertal gynecomastia because they allow the efficacy of the pharmacological and surgical treatment to be evaluated in a multidisciplinary approach to one of the most frequent endocrine manifestations of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Transplacental transmission of HSV infection is rare, typically associated with Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2) and often reported in term infants, whereas only a few cases of preterm infants with Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) infection are found in the literature. We report the case of a transplacental HSV-1 infection in preterm twins born at 27\u2009weeks gestation. At 23\u2009weeks gestation the mother had experienced primary gingivostomatitis and \"flu-like\" symptoms, which healed without specific treatment. At birth both infants presented disseminated ulcerated skin lesions at the head, trunk and extremities. Soon after birth, the infants required mechanical ventilation and showed multiple organ involvement. On the basis of the mother's positive HSV-1 serology, treatment was established before the Tzanck test, serological findings and polymerase chain reaction of the skin and blood had confirmed the neonatal infection. In spite of the early diagnosis within hours after birth and immediate treatment, the extensive skin involvement associated with rapidly progressing multiorgan failure resulted in death of both infants within 3 days. Although a primary HSV-1 infection during pregnancy is extremely rare, gingivostomatitis with general symptoms can lead to transplacental infection and should therefore be taken seriously. Prompt recognition and treatment in the mother are paramount and might be life-saving for the infants.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

    "abstract": "To find a potential underlying cause for Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome (MRKHS) discordance in monozygotic twins.\nProspective comparative study.\nUniversity hospital.\nOur study genetically analyzed 5 MRKHS-discordant monozygotic twin pairs with the unique opportunity to include saliva and rudimentary uterine tissue.\nBlood, saliva, or rudimentary uterine tissue from five MRKHS-discordant twins was analyzed and compared between twin pairs as well as within the same individual where applicable. We used copy number variations (CNVs) to identify differences.\nCNVs in blood, rudimentary uterine tissue, and saliva, network analysis, and review of the literature.\nOne duplication found in the affected twin included two genes, matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 10 (LRP10), which have known functions in the embryonic development of the uterus and endometrium. The duplicated region was detected in rudimentary uterine tissue from the same individual but not in saliva, making a tissue-specific mosaicism a possible explanation for twin discordance. Additional network analysis revealed important connections to differentially expressed genes from previous studies. These genes encode several molecules involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and neoangiogenesis.\nMMP-14, LRP-10, ECM, and neoangiogenesis genes are identified as candidate genes in a tissue-specific mosaicism. The detected clusters provide evidence of deficient vascularization during uterine development and/or disturbed reorganization of ECM components, potentially during m\u00fcllerian duct elongation signaled by the embryologically relevant phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway.\u00a0Therefore, we consider these genes to be new candidates in the manifestation of MRKHS.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins share nearly all of their genetic variants and many similar environments before and after birth. However, they can also show phenotypic discordance for a wide range of traits. Differences at the epigenetic level may account for such discordances. It is well established that epigenetic states can contribute to phenotypic variation, including disease. Epigenetic states are dynamic and potentially reversible marks involved in gene regulation, which can be influenced by genetics, environment, and stochastic events. Here, we review advances in epigenetic studies of discordant MZ twins, focusing on disease. The study of epigenetics and disease using discordant MZ twins offers the opportunity to control for many potential confounders encountered in general population studies, such as differences in genetic background, early-life environmental exposure, age, gender, and cohort effects. Recently, analysis of disease-discordant MZ twins has been successfully used to study epigenetic mechanisms in aging, cancer, autoimmune disease, psychiatric, neurological, and multiple other traits. Epigenetic aberrations have been found in a range of phenotypes, and challenges have been identified, including sampling time, tissue specificity, validation, and replication. The results have relevance for personalized medicine approaches, including the identification of prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic targets. The findings also help to identify epigenetic markers of environmental risk and molecular mechanisms involved in disease and disease progression, which have implications both for understanding disease and for future medical research.",

    "abstract": "Studies on the human gut microbiota have suggested that human individuals could be categorized into enterotypes based on the compositions of their gut microbial communities. Here, we report that the gut microbiota of healthy Koreans are clustered into two enterotypes, dominated by either Bacteroides (enterotype 1) or Prevotella (enterotype 2). More than 72% of the paired fecal samples from monozygotic twin pairs were assigned to the same enterotype. Our longitudinal analysis of these twins indicated that more than 80% of the individuals belonged to the same enterotype after about a 2-year interval. Microbial functions based on KEGG pathways were also divided into two clusters. For enterotype 2, 100% of the samples belonged to the same functional cluster, while for enterotype 1, approximately half of the samples belonged to each functional cluster. Enterotype 2 was significantly associated with long-term dietary habits that were high in dietary fiber, various vitamins, and minerals. Among anthropometrical and biochemical traits, the level of serum uric acid was associated with enterotype. These results suggest that host genetics as well as host properties such as long-term dietary patterns and a particular clinical biomarker could be important contributors to the enterotype of an individual.",

    "abstract": "A low birth weight has been extensively related to poor adult health outcomes. Birth weight can be seen as a proxy for environmental conditions during prenatal development. Identical twin pairs discordant for birth weight provide an extraordinary model for investigating the association between birth weight and adult life health while controlling for not only genetics but also postnatal rearing environment. We performed an epigenome-wide profiling on blood samples from 150 pairs of adult monozygotic twins discordant for birth weight to look for molecular evidence of epigenetic signatures in association with birth weight discordance.\nOur association analysis revealed no CpG site with genome-wide statistical significance (FDR < 0.05) for either qualitative (larger or smaller) or quantitative discordance in birth weight. Even with selected samples of extremely birth weight discordant twin pairs, no significant site was found except for 3 CpGs that displayed age-dependent intra-pair differential methylation with FDRs 0.014 (cg26856578, p = 3.42e-08), 0.0256 (cg15122603, p = 1.25e-07) and 0.0258 (cg16636641, p = 2.05e-07). Among the three sites, intra-pair differential methylation increased with age for cg26856578 but decreased with age for cg15122603 and cg16636641. There was no genome-wide statistical significance for sex-dependent effects on intra-pair differential methylation in either the whole samples or the extremely discordant twins.\nGenome-wide DNA methylation profiling did not reveal epigenetic signatures of birth weight discordance although some sites displayed age-dependent intra-pair differential methylation in the extremely discordant twin pairs.",

Among the three sites, intra-pair differential methylation increased with age for cg26856578 but decreased with age for cg15122603 and cg16636641. There was no genome-wide statistical significance for sex-dependent effects on intra-pair differential methylation in either the whole samples or the extremely discordant twins.",

    "abstract": "The objective is to evaluate whether a breach presentation of the second twin has an influence on the perinatal results in vaginal births of bichorial-biamniotic twins after 33rd week of pregnancy.\nRetrospective analysis.\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno.\nThe current study is a retrospective analysis of 695 vaginal births of bichorial-biamniotic twins after 33rd week of pregnancy. All births were conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno during the span of 2004-2013. The sample was divided into2 groups. Group A consisted of 550 births of both twins in vertex presentation, group B consisted of 145 births in which the second twin happened to be in the breach presentation. The factors that have been evaluated include the percentage of births finished vaginally, perinatal results (pH a. umbilicalis below 7.0 and Apgar score in the 5th minute below 5) and early neonatal mortality and morbidity. Data from both groups have been compared with the use of Fishers exact test.\nFor the group A, 81.3% of births were finished vaginally, as opposed to 85.5% in group B. Acute Caesarean sections conducted on the second twin consisted 4% (22 cases) in group A and 3.4% (5 cases) in group B. No significant difference has been found between the two groups in both perinatal results (p = 0.6 for pH from a. umbilicalis below 7.0 and p = 0.7 for Apgar score in the 5th minute below 5; both two-tailed) and in the frequency of early neonatal mortality and morbidity. In total,5 neonatal deaths have occured in 28 days after birth, out of which 2 have occured in group A and 3 in group B.\nIt was concluded that breach presentation of the second twin does not influence perinatal results in vaginal births of bichorial-biamniotic twins.\nbichorial-biamniotic twins, vaginal birth, breach presentation, perinatal mortality, perinatal morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Cytokines and vitamin D both have a role in modulating the immune system, and are also potentially useful biomarkers in mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia. Studying the variability of cytokines and vitamin D in a healthy population sample may add to understanding the association between these biomarkers and mental illness. To assess genetic and environmental contributions to variation in circulating levels of cytokines and vitamin D (25-hydroxy vitamin D: 25(OH)D3), we analyzed data from a healthy adolescent twin cohort (mean age 16.2 years; standard deviation 0.25). Plasma cytokine measures were available for 400 individuals (85 MZ, 115 DZ pairs), dried blood spot sample vitamin D measures were available for 378 individuals (70 MZ, 118 DZ pairs). Heritability estimates were moderate but significant for the cytokines transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), 0.57 (95% CI 0.26-0.80) and tumor necrosis factor-receptor type 1 (TNFR1), 0.50 (95% CI 0.11-0.63) respectively. Measures of 25(OH)D3 were within normal range and heritability was estimated to be high (0.86, 95% CI 0.61-0.94). Assays of other cytokines did not generate meaningful results. These potential biomarkers may be useful in mental illness, with further research warranted in larger sample sizes. They may be particularly important in adolescents with mental illness where diagnostic uncertainty poses a significant clinical challenge.",

    "abstract": "Adult health outcomes and health behaviors are often associated with schooling. However, such associations do not necessarily imply that schooling has causal effects on health with the signs or magnitudes found in the cross-sectional associations. Schooling may be proxying for unobserved factors related to genetics and family background that directly affect both health and schooling. Recently several studies have used within-monozygotic (MZ) twins methods to control for unobserved factors shared by identical twins. Within-MZ estimates for developed countries are generally smaller than suggested by cross-sectional associations, consistent with positive correlations between unobserved factors that determine schooling and those that determine health. This study contributes new estimates of cross-sectional associations and within-MZ causal effects using the Chinese Adults Twins Survey, the first study of its type for developing countries. The cross-sectional estimates suggest that schooling is significantly associated with adult health-related behaviors (smoking, drinking, exercising) but not with own or spouse health outcomes (general health, mental health, overweight, chronic diseases). However, within-MZ-twins estimators change the estimates for approximately half of these health indicators, in one case declining in absolute magnitudes and becoming insignificant and in the other cases increasing in absolute magnitudes. Within-MZ estimates indicate significant pro-health effects for at least one of the indicators for own health (better mental health), own health-related behaviors (less smoking) and spouse health (less overweight).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has been attributed to a combination of genetic and nongenetic factors. We studied a set of monozygotic twins harboring the heterozygous glucocerebrosidase mutation (GBA N370S) but clinically discordant for PD. We applied induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology for PD disease modeling using the twins' fibroblasts to evaluate and dissect the genetic and nongenetic contributions. Utilizing fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we obtained a homogenous population of \"footprint-free\" iPSC-derived midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. The mDA neurons from both twins had \u223c50% GBA enzymatic activity, \u223c3-fold elevated \u03b1-synuclein protein levels, and a reduced capacity to synthesize and release dopamine. Interestingly, the affected twin's neurons showed an even lower dopamine level, increased monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) expression, and impaired intrinsic network activity. Overexpression of wild-type GBA and treatment with MAO-B inhibitors normalized \u03b1-synuclein and dopamine levels, suggesting a combination therapy for the affected twin.",

    "abstract": "To compare monozygotic twinning (MZT) rates in patients undergoing blastocyst or cleavage-stage ET.\nRetrospective cohort.\nAcademic research center.\nAutologous, fresh IVF cycles resulting in a clinical pregnancy from 1999 to 2014.\nNone.\nMonozygotic twin pregnancy in blastocyst-stage transfer vs. cleavage-stage transfer when controlling for patient prognosis and embryo cohort quality factors.\nThere were a total of 9,969 fresh transfer cycles resulting in a pregnancy during the study period. Of these pregnancies, 234 monozygotic twin pregnancies were identified (2.4%). Of all transfers, 5,191 were cleavage-stage and 4,778 were blastocyst-stage transfers. There were a total of 99 MZT identified in the cleavage-stage group (1.9%) and 135 MZT in the blastocyst ET group (2.4%), which was significant. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that increasing age was associated with a significant reduction in MZT, regardless of transfer order. Embryo cohort quality factors, including the number and proportion of six- to eight-cell embryos and availability of supernumerary embryos, were also significant. When controlling for patient age, time period during which the cycle took place, the number and proportion of six- to eight-cell embryos, and availability of supernumerary embryos, there was no longer a difference in MZT rate between blastocyst and cleavage transfer.\nPatient prognosis and embryo cohort quality seem to be major factors in MZT rate in women undergoing blastocyst transfer. Although technology-based effects cannot be excluded, patient and embryo characteristics play an important role.",

Discussion and Literature Review\u2003A literature review numbers approximately 100 reports of IPP. This condition has been classically classified into three categories: congenital/familiar (i.e., female sex, positive parental history of IPP), acquired (mainly due to constipation), and associated with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.

    "abstract": "Palmar and finger dermatoglyphics are formed between the 10th and the 17th weeks of gestation and their morphology can be influenced by genetic or environmental factors, interfering with normal intrauterine development. As both the skin and the brain develop from the same embryonal ectoderm, dermatoglyphic alterations may be informative for early abnormal neurodevelopmental processes in the brain. We investigated whether dermatoglyphic alterations are related to structural brain abnormalities in bipolar disorder and to what extent they are of a genetic and of an environmental origin. Dermatoglyphics and volumetric data from structural MRI were obtained in 53 twin pairs concordant or discordant for bipolar disorder and 51 healthy matched control twin pairs. Structural equation modeling was used. Bipolar disorder was significantly positively associated with palmar a-b ridge count (ABRC), indicating higher ABRC in bipolar patients (rph=.17 (CI .04-.30)). Common genes appear to be involved because the genetic correlation with ABRC was significant (rph-A=.21 (CI .05-.36). Irrespective of disease, ABRC showed a genetically mediated association with brain volume, indicated by a significant genetic correlation rph-A of respectively -.36 (CI -.52 to -.22) for total brain, -.34 (CI -.51 to -.16) total cortical volume, -.27 (CI -.43 to -.08) cortical gray matter and -.23 (CI -.41 to -.04) cortical white matter. In conclusion, a genetically determined abnormal development of the foetal ectoderm between the 10th and 15th week of gestation appears related to smaller brain volumes in (subjects at risk for) bipolar disorder.",

    "abstract": "The understanding of the role of genetic factors in phenotypic variation in the emergence of secondary teeth in humans remains is incomplete. Dental emergence data based on a mixed longitudinal study were collected on 111 twin pairs from an urban population of Chandigarh. The observations over time on a single individual varied from one to nine, thus giving a total of 595 entities. Female twins manifested emergence priority over males. The differences between zygosities in mean emergence ages were significant for only 6 of 16 (37%) instances. Magnitude of variations seen between twins and singletons in their mean emergence timings and duration of the hiatus between two dental phases of emergence were of the order observed among different samples from the same population/ethnic group. Heritability estimates for the specified number of the teeth emerged showed age variations. These estimates were highest in the first two age groups (from 5 to 7 years), when the first molars and incisors emerged. Maxilla-mandible differences were seen for tooth emergence timings and sequence patterns. Heritability for tooth emergence timings was higher in maxilla than in mandible. Multifactorial model of inheritance was the best fit model to explain variations observed in dental emergence timings and dental sequence pattern polymorphisms and there were significant genetic components of variation for both of these. There were sex differences in heritability; females had higher estimates than males. Genetic factors accounted for about 60% of the total phenotypic variation in the length of hiatus interval between two active stages of permanent teeth emergence.",

    "abstract": "Multifetal pregnancy reduction (MPR) of triplets to twins results in improved pregnancy outcomes compared with triplet gestations managed expectantly. Perinatal outcomes of early transvaginal MPR from triplets to twins were compared with reduction from triplets to singletons. Seventy-four trichorionic triplet pregnancies that underwent early transvaginal MPR at 6-8 weeks gestation were included. Cases were divided into two groups according to the initial procedure: reduction to twin (n = 55) or to singleton (n = 19) gestations. Infants from triplet pregnancies reduced to twins were delivered earlier (36.6 versus 37.9 weeks; P = 0.04) and had lower mean birth weights (2364\u2009g versus 2748\u2009g; P = 0.02) compared with those from triplets reduced to singleton gestations. The rates of pregnancy loss before 24 weeks (3.6% versus 5.3%), as well as of preterm delivery before 32 and 34 weeks of gestation (0% versus 5.3% and 7.3% versus 5.3%, respectively) were similar between the twin and singleton pregnancies. No significant difference was found in the prevalence of gestational diabetes (15.1% versus 5.6%) or gestational hypertension (24.5% versus 16.7%) between the groups. Selective reduction of triplet pregnancies to singleton rather than twin gestations is associated with improved outcomes.",

However, little is known about the variability of DNA methylation patterns in adolescence, a period involving significant and rapid physical, emotional, social, and neurodevelopmental change. Here, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation using the 450\u2009K Illumina BeadChip in a sample of 37 MZ twin pairs followed longitudinally since birth to investigate: 1) the extent of variation in DNA methylation in identical genetic backgrounds in adolescence and; 2) whether these variations are randomly distributed or enriched in particular functional pathways. We also assessed stability of DNA methylation over 3-6 months to distinguish stable trait-like and variable state-like genes. A pathway analysis found high within-pair variability in genes associated with development, cellular mechanisms, tissue and cell morphology, and various disorders. Test-retest analyses performed in a sub-sample of 8 twin pairs demonstrated enrichment in gene pathways involved in organismal development, cellular growth and proliferation, cell signaling, and particular disorders. The variability found in functional gene pathways may plausibly underlie phenotypic differences in this adolescent MZ twin sample. Furthermore, we assessed stability of methylation over 3-6 months and found that some genes were stable while others were unstable, suggesting that the methylome remains dynamic in adolescence and that dynamic sites tend to be organized in certain gene pathways.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic architecture of gene expression is an intermediate step in understanding the genetic architecture of complex diseases. RNA sequencing technologies have improved the quantification of gene expression and allow measurement of allele-specific expression (ASE). ASE is hypothesized to result from the direct effect of cis regulatory variants, but a proper estimation of the causes of ASE has not been performed thus far. In this study, we take advantage of a sample of twins to measure the relative contributions of genetic and environmental effects to ASE, and we find substantial effects from gene \u00d7 gene (G\u00d7G) and gene \u00d7 environment (G\u00d7E) interactions. We propose a model where ASE requires genetic variability in cis, a difference in the sequence of both alleles, but where the magnitude of the ASE effect depends on trans genetic and environmental factors that interact with the cis genetic variants.",

    "abstract": "Unicameral bone cysts (UBCs) are benign tumor-like lesions that commonly occur in the diaphyseal or metaphyseal region of the long bones within the first 2 decades of life. Until today, the pathogenesis of UBC has been unclear, but mechanisms such as vascular occlusion or a response to trauma have been supposed. During the past decade, in particular, the genetic aspects of the development of this rare lesion have been discussed. We present the first case of mirror image monozygotic twins with a mirror image UBC of the calcaneus. Our findings reinforce the importance of additional studies to understand the significance of cytogenetic factors in the etiology of UBC.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophilia in adults refers to an alteration in the total number of blood neutrophils that is in excess of about 7500 cells/\u03bcL. This definition is restrictive in childhood as neutrophil count is age-dependent. Chronic Idiopathic Neutrophilia (CIN) refers to a condition that persists for many years in individuals who appear otherwise healthy. CIN is rarely mentioned in scientific literature and in academic books of hematology; only few words are dedicated to this topic. We report a case study of two twins with CIN followed from the first year of life to 24 years of age. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case report of two twins with CIN followed through a long period of time. We believe that our observation may contribute to better understand and characterize this hematologic abnormality.",

    "abstract": "Microtia is a spectrum of congenital deformities, which varies from barely discernable to anotia. Twinning is a well-known risk factor for congenital defects including external ear deformities. Monozygotic twins usually show identical appearances as well as congenital malformations. In special conditions as ear deformities, \"mirror-image\" may also occur. We report 2 cases of monozygotic twins with different ear deformities. The 8-year-old propositus with lobule type microtia and her identical female twin presented with facial symmetry. Patient A had sausage-type right microtia with absence of external auditory canal. The left external ear showed normal appearance. Patient B presented with left-sided preauricular skin tag and right-sided malformation of tragus with skin tag combined with hyperplasia of underlying cartilage. A granule-size skin tag was also noticed at crus of right helix. A 7-year-old male patient with right-sided conchal type microtia presented to an ear reconstruction center. The patient's mother showed normal auricular appearance. Her monozygotic twin sister, whose son and daughter had normal ear appearance, was diagnosed with a leftsided lobule type microtia.",

    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurodevelopmental disorder that predominantly affects females, is primarily caused by variants in MECP2. Variants in other genes such as CDKL5 and FOXG1 are usually associated with individuals who manifest distinct phenotypes that may overlap with RTT. Individuals with phenotypes suggestive of RTT are typically screened for variants in MECP2 and then subsequently the other genes dependent on the specific phenotype. Even with this screening strategy, there are individuals in whom no causative variant can be identified, suggesting that there are other novel genes that contribute to the RTT phenotype. Here we report a de novo deletion of protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 4 (PTPN4) in identical twins with a RTT-like phenotype. We also demonstrate the reduced expression of Ptpn4 in a Mecp2 null mouse model of RTT, as well as the activation of the PTPN4 promoter by MeCP2. Our findings suggest that PTPN4 should be considered for addition to the growing list of genes that warrant screening in individuals with a RTT-like phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) account for 1-2% of all tumors in young and middle aged men. A 75-fold increase in TCGT development has been reported for monozygotic (MZ) twins. Therefore, the occurrence of simultaneous tumors in MZ twins emphasizes the importance of genetic factors that influence the risk of developing these tumors. Genomic screening was performed for one family containing MZ twins with testicular germ cell tumors, in order to define alterations associated with risk of tumor development.\nCopy number alterations were evaluated using array-CGH (4x44K, Agilent Technologies) in one seminoma and one embryonal carcinoma (EC) from MZ twins. In addition, genomic alterations from the tumors and peripheral blood cells of the twins were compared to the parental genomes via their peripheral blood cells.\nEmbryonal carcinoma (Twin-1\u00a0t) presented a lower frequency of genomic alterations compared to the seminoma (Twin-2\u00a0t). One minimal common region of loss was observed in 9p13.1-p12 in the comparison between DNA from blood samples for Twin-1 and Twin-2. In this region is mapped the CNTNAP3 gene which was confirmed as involved in losses by qPCR. Comparative analysis of novel CNVs between the Twin-1\u00a0t and Twin-2\u00a0t showed five minimal common regions involving gain at chromosomes 12 (12p12.3-p11.1 and 12p13.33-p12.3), while losses were observed at 10p15.3-p15.2, 13q21.1-q21.2 and 15q11.1-q11.2. In addition, one exclusive rare copy number alteration was detected in Twin-1\u00a0t and Twin-2\u00a0t, and 19 novel alterations were identified in the Twin-2\u00a0t.\nDistinct genomic profiles for MZ twins with phenotypically different TGCT were described. Of particular interest, 12p gains were detected exclusively in tumor samples. In peripheral blood samples, loss of 9p13.1-p12 was the unique novel CNV shared by the twins, confirming the involvement of CNTNAP3 gene in TGCTs development. Although similar CNV profiles were shared by both the peripheral blood and tumor samples of the twins, tumor-specific CNV loci were identified for seminoma and non-seminomatous tumors. These findings suggest the presence of de novo germline structural alterations and TGCT predisposition.",

    "abstract": "Both alcohol-specific genetic factors and genetic factors related to externalizing behavior influence problematic alcohol use. Little is known, however, about the etiologic role of these 2 components of genetic risk on alcohol-related behaviors across development. Prior studies conducted in a male cohort of twins suggest that externalizing genetic factors are important for predicting heavy alcohol use in adolescence, whereas alcohol-specific genetic factors increase in importance during the transition to adulthood. In this report, we studied twin brothers and sisters and brother-sister twin pairs to examine such developmental trajectories and investigate whether sex and cotwin sex effects modify these genetic influences.\nWe used prospective, longitudinal twin data collected between ages 12 and 22 within the population-based FinnTwin12 cohort study (analytic n\u00a0=\u00a01,864). Our dependent measures of alcohol use behaviors included alcohol initiation (age 12), intoxication frequency (ages 14 and 17), and alcohol dependence criteria (age 22). Each individual's genetic risk of alcohol use disorders (AUD-GR) was indexed by his/her parents' and cotwin's DSM-IV Alcohol Dependence (AD) criterion counts. Likewise, each individual's genetic risk of externalizing disorders (EXT-GR) was indexed with a composite measure of parents' and cotwin's DSM-IV Conduct Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder criterion counts.\nEXT-GR was most strongly related to alcohol use behaviors during adolescence, while AUD-GR was most strongly related to alcohol problems in young adulthood. Further, sex of the twin and sex of the cotwin significantly moderated the associations between genetic risk and alcohol use behaviors across development: AUD-GR influenced early adolescent alcohol use behaviors in females more than in males, and EXT-GR influenced age 22 AD more in males than in females. In addition, the associations of AUD-GR and EXT-GR with intoxication frequency were greater among 14- and 17-year-old females with twin brothers.\nWe found divergent developmental trajectories for alcohol-specific and externalizing behavior-related genetic influences on alcohol use behaviors; in early adolescence, genetic influences on alcohol use behaviors are largely nonspecific, and later in adolescence and young adulthood, alcohol-specific genetic influences on alcohol use are more influential. Importantly, within these overall trajectories, several interesting sex differences emerged. We found that the relationship between genetic risk and problematic drinking across development is moderated by the individual's sex and his/her cotwin's sex. AUD-GR influenced adolescent alcohol outcomes in females more than in males and by age 22, EXT-GR influenced AD criteria more for males than females. In addition, the association between genetic risk and intoxication frequency was greater among 14- and 17-year-old females with male cotwins.",

    "abstract": "The behavioural symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are thought to reflect underlying cognitive deficits/differences. The findings in the literature are somewhat mixed regarding the cognitive features of ASD. This study attempted to address this issue by investigating a range of cognitive deficits and the prevalence of multiple cognitive atypicalities in a large population-based sample comprising children with ASD, their unaffected co-twins, and typically developing comparison children.\nParticipants included families from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) where one or both children met diagnostic criteria for ASD. Overall, 181 adolescents with a diagnosis of ASD and 73 unaffected co-twins were included, plus an additional 160 comparison control participants. An extensive cognitive battery was administered to measure IQ, central coherence, executive function, and theory of mind ability.\nDifferences between groups (ASD, co-twin, control) are reported on tasks assessing theory of mind, executive function, and central coherence. The ASD group performed atypically in significantly more cognitive tasks than the unaffected co-twin and control groups. Nearly a third of the ASD group presented with multiple cognitive atypicalities.\nMultiple cognitive atypicalities appear to be a characteristic, but not universal feature, of ASD. Further work is needed to investigate whether specific cognitive atypicalities, either alone or together, are related to specific behaviours characteristic of ASD.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with type 2 diabetes and risk of developing the disease in skeletal muscle biopsies from phenotypically well-characterised twins.\nWe measured muscle miRNA levels in monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for type 2 diabetes using arrays. Further investigations of selected miRNAs included target prediction, pathway analysis, silencing in cells and association analyses in a separate cohort of 164 non-diabetic MZ and dizygotic twins. The effects of elevated glucose and insulin levels on miRNA expression were examined, and the effect of low birthweight (LBW) was studied in rats.\nWe identified 20 miRNAs that were downregulated in MZ twins with diabetes compared with their non-diabetic co-twins. Differences for members of the miR-15 family (miR-15b and miR-16) were the most statistically significant, and these miRNAs were predicted to influence insulin signalling. Indeed, miR-15b and miR-16 levels were associated with levels of key insulin signalling proteins, miR-15b was associated with the insulin receptor in non-diabetic twins and knockdown of miR-15b/miR-16 in myocytes changed the levels of insulin signalling proteins. LBW in twins and undernutrition during pregnancy in rats were, in contrast to overt type 2 diabetes, associated with increased expression of miR-15b and/or miR-16. Elevated glucose and insulin suppressed miR-16 expression in vitro.\nType 2 diabetes is associated with non-genetic downregulation of several miRNAs in skeletal muscle including miR-15b and miR-16, potentially targeting insulin signalling. The paradoxical findings in twins with overt diabetes and twins at increased risk of the disease underscore the complexity of the regulation of muscle insulin signalling in glucose homeostasis.",

    "results": "We identified 20 miRNAs that were downregulated in MZ twins with diabetes compared with their non-diabetic co-twins. Differences for members of the miR-15 family (miR-15b and miR-16) were the most statistically significant, and these miRNAs were predicted to influence insulin signalling. Indeed, miR-15b and miR-16 levels were associated with levels of key insulin signalling proteins, miR-15b was associated with the insulin receptor in non-diabetic twins and knockdown of miR-15b/miR-16 in myocytes changed the levels of insulin signalling proteins. LBW in twins and undernutrition during pregnancy in rats were, in contrast to overt type 2 diabetes, associated with increased expression of miR-15b and/or miR-16. Elevated glucose and insulin suppressed miR-16 expression in vitro.",

    "abstract": "To determine the differences in risk factors for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in paired twins.\nA retrospective medical record review was performed for all paired twins screened for ROP between 2007 and 2012. Screening was offered to very low birth weight (\u2264 1500 grams) and preterm (\u2264 32 weeks) neonates. Twins 1 and 2 were categorized based on the order of delivery. Maternal and neonatal covariates were analyzed using univariate and multivariate regression analyses for both ROP and Type 1 ROP.\nIn 34 pairs of Chinese twins, the mean gestational age (GA) was 30.2 \u00b1 2.0 weeks. In Twin 1, smaller GA (OR = 0.44, P = 0.02), higher mean oxygen concentration (OR = 1.34, P = 0.03), presence of thrombocytopenia (OR = 1429.60, P < 0.0001), and intraventricular hemorrhage (OR = 18.67, P = 0.03) were significant risk factors for ROP. For Twin 2, a smaller GA (OR = 0.45, P = 0.03) was the only risk factor. There were no significant risk factors for ROP in Twin 1 or Twin 2 on multivariate analysis.\nIn Chinese twin pairs, smaller GA was the only common risk factor for ROP while Twin 1 was more susceptible to the postnatal risks for ROP.",

    "abstract": "Posture and plantar pressure distribution can influence several factors, including both foot type and heritability. Therefore, the purpose was to assess the influence of foot type and heritability and their effects on foot characteristics. Static and dynamic balance and plantar pressure distribution was assessed, and the participants were pairs of female twins.\nSixteen monozygotic and fourteen dizygotic pairs with no history of injuries were included in this causal-comparative study, divided into three foot types by navicular drop test: pes planus, pes rectus and pes cavus. Static balance was measured using the stork test and dynamic balance using the SEBT test. Plantar pressure distributions were measured by the emed platform. Two-way ANOVA, F test, heritability estimate, intraclass correlation coefficient and Fisher Z test were used for statistical analysis.\nNo significant differences were found between foot types or zygosities in static and dynamic balance and peak pressure (P>0.05). Within-pair variances were significantly different in dynamic balance in PL and L directions (P<0.05). Heritability was 0.43, 0.52, 0.62, 0.65 and 0.39 in static balance and dynamic balance variables in P, PL, L and mean of eight directions, respectively. Genetic factors revealed no influence on peak pressure. Within-pair correlations were significantly different in dynamic balance results in PL and L directions (P<0.05).\nFoot type and zygosities had no influence on balance or peak pressure. Genetic factors moderately influenced postural balance, but not peak pressure. The current study is an asset to identify and manage influential factors in these variables for female twins.",

    "abstract": "Studies on twins with concordant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have revealed that ETV6-RUNX1 gene fusion is a common, prenatal genetic event with other driver aberrations occurring subclonally and probably postnatally. The fetal cell type that is transformed by ETV6-RUNX1 is not identified by such studies or by the analysis of early B-cell lineage phenotype of derived progeny. Ongoing, clonal immunoglobulin (IG) and cross-lineage T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements are features of B-cell precursor leukemia and commence at the pro-B-cell stage of normal B-cell lineage development. We reasoned that shared clonal rearrangements of IG or TCR genes by concordant ALL in twins would be informative about the fetal cell type in which clonal advantage is elicited by ETV6-RUNX1. Five pairs of twins were analyzed for all varieties of IG and TCR gene rearrangements. All pairs showed identical incomplete or complete variable-diversity-joining junctions coupled with substantial, subclonal and divergent rearrangements. This pattern was endorsed by single-cell genetic scrutiny in one twin pair. Our data suggest that the pre-leukemic initiating function of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion is associated with clonal expansion early in the fetal B-cell lineage.",

    "abstract": "Negative cognitive bias and aberrant neural processing of emotional faces are trait-marks of depression. Yet it is unclear whether these changes constitute an endophenotype for depression and are also present in healthy individuals with hereditary risk for depression.\nThirty healthy, never-depressed monozygotic (MZ) twins with a co-twin history of depression (high risk group: n\u00a0=\u00a013) or without co-twin history of depression (low-risk group: n\u00a0=\u00a017) were enrolled in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. During fMRI, participants viewed fearful and happy faces while performing a gender discrimination task. After the scan, they were given a faces dot-probe task, a facial expression recognition task and questionnaires assessing mood, personality traits and coping strategies.\nHigh-risk twins showed increased neural response to happy and fearful faces in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), pre-supplementary motor area and occipito-parietal regions compared to low-risk twins. They also displayed stronger negative coupling between amygdala and pregenual ACC, dmPFC and temporo-parietal regions during emotional face processing. These task-related changes in neural responses in high-risk twins were accompanied by impaired gender discrimination performance during face processing. They also displayed increased attention vigilance for fearful faces and were slower at recognizing facial expressions relative to low-risk controls. These effects occurred in the absence of differences between groups in mood, subjective state or coping.\nDifferent neural response and functional connectivity within fronto-limbic and occipito-parietal regions during emotional face processing and enhanced fear vigilance may be key endophenotypes for depression.",

    "abstract": "Despite the notion that monozygotic (identical) twins share 100% identical genetic information, genetic differences among monozygotic twin pairs do occur and can be explained by mechanisms occurring during post-zygotic events. Despite such twins being fundamentally \"identical\", these post-zygotic genetic changes may give rise to phenotypic differences and genetic diseases. Consequently, studies of monozygotic twin pairs discordant for specific genetic diseases represent an important tool for the identification of disease genes. We used array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and methylation arrays to search for genetic and epigenetic differences in blood drawn from four monozygotic twin pairs discordant for testicular germ cell tumors. No consistent differences were identified. A larger twin study would be required to achieve confident discovery of very subtle differences between monozygotic twins discordant for testicular germ cell tumors.",

    "abstract": "While previous studies have shown a link between cigarette smoking and disordered eating (DE), it is less clear whether this association can be explained by attempts to control weight and/or temperament. This study had two aims: to examine weight/shape and DE symptomatology associated with weight control-related smoking and disordered eating; second, to investigate whether temperament-based factors explain the association between compensatory smoking and weight and shape-related characteristics, and disordered eating symptoms.\nFemale twins (N = 1,002) from the Australian Twin Registry, aged 28-39 years, were assessed by interview yielding lifetime diagnostic information of disordered eating and use of cigarette smoking for weight control. Self-report measures of temperament were available.\nWomen who had never smoked (50.6%, n = 495) or had smoked for reasons other than weight and shape control (42.5%, n = 415) were generally not differentiated with respect to indicators of disordered eating. Women who smoked for reasons primarily associated with weight and shape control (6.9%, n = 67) had significantly higher levels of disordered eating than non-smokers identified as being higher levels of purging (OR = 4.55, 95% CI = 2.41-8.59) and fasting (OR = 9.32, 94% CI = 4.43-19.90) but not objective binge episodes (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 0.71-3.99). Of those women diagnosed with lifetime eating disorders, weight-control smokers had higher levels of purging (OR = 4.22, 95% CI = 1.13-15.80) than those who did not. There were no differences in temperament.\nResults support co-occurrence of smoking for weight control and purging in both community and clinical groups, and indicate this association is related to weight control and not temperament.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the potential contributions of environmental factors to variations in facial symmetry between identical twins.\nIdentical male and female twins were recruited from the Twins Days Festival in 2009 and 2010. Subjects independently completed a comprehensive questionnaire on their medical and personal history, and then posed for digital facial photography from several different angles. Eight facial features from these photographs were measured using Adobe Photoshop, and these facial features were then analyzed against survey responses between twins through multivariate regressions.\nA total of 147 pairs of identical twins were included. Twins who slept primarily prone had greater nasal midline deviation (p = 0.047) and oral commissure asymmetry (p = 0.027). Tooth extractions were significantly associated with canting of the plane of occlusion (p = 0.043), and use of dentures was associated with nasal midline deviation (p = 0.032) and oral commissure asymmetry (p = 0.007). Smoking was associated with canting of the plane of occlusion (p = 0.049) and upper eyelid ptosis (p = 0.023). Lastly, headaches were also associated with nasal midline deviation (p = 0.024).\nExogenous factors such as prone sleep position, tooth extractions, dentures, and smoking are significant risk factors for facial asymmetry.\nRisk, II.",

    "abstract": "We investigated age and gender effects on \"Positive Orientation\" (POS)-an individual's tendency to view life with a positive outlook-using a genetically informed design. Study subjects were 1016 twins aged 22-75 from the Italian twin registry. We assessed POS by the recently developed P-scale. First, we used confirmatory factor analysis to investigate scale's measurement invariance by age and gender. Then, we applied biometric modelling to estimate genetic and environmental components of POS score. Overall, we found a satisfactory degree of measurement invariance by both age and gender. Results from these analyses further indicated an increasing mean level of POS across the lifespan. Additive genetic and unshared environmental factors explained respectively 58% and 42% of variance in POS score, with no significant gender differences; furthermore, the pattern of change of gene-environment architecture of POS over time was consistent with a greater plasticity of personality at older ages.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we investigated genetic and environmental effects on motor impulsivity from childhood to late adolescence using a longitudinal sample of twins from ages 9 to 18 years. Motor impulsivity was assessed using errors of commission (no-go errors) in a visual go/no-go task at 4 time points: ages 9-10, 11-13, 14-15, and 16-18 years. Significant genetic and nonshared environmental effects on motor impulsivity were found at each of the 4 waves of assessment with genetic factors explaining 22%-41% of the variance within each of the 4 waves. Phenotypically, children's average performance improved across age (i.e., fewer no-go errors during later assessments). Multivariate biometric analyses revealed that common genetic factors influenced 12%-40% of the variance in motor impulsivity across development, whereas nonshared environmental factors common to all time points contributed to 2%-52% of the variance. Nonshared environmental influences specific to each time point also significantly influenced motor impulsivity. Overall, results demonstrated that although genetic factors were critical to motor impulsivity across development, both common and specific nonshared environmental factors played a strong role in the development of motor impulsivity across age.

    "abstract": "An association between male fertility and risk of prostate cancer has been suggested, possibly through lower androgen levels in subfertile men. We evaluated male fertility in relation to risk of prostate cancer by assessing the frequency of fathering of dizygotic twins, a marker of high fertility, among cases of prostate cancer and controls.\nWe performed a case-control study in Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe), a nationwide, population-based cohort. PCBaSe was linked to the Swedish twin register for information on zygosity for same-sex twins and to other nationwide health care registers and demographic databases for information on socioeconomic factors, comorbidity, and tumor characteristics for 96 301 prostate cancer cases and 378 583 matched controls. To account for the influence of in vitro fertilization on dizygotic twinning, analyses were restricted to men who had fathered children before 1991, when in vitro fertilization was still uncommon in Sweden.\n1 112 cases and 4 538 controls had fathered dizygotic twins. Men with dizygotic twins had no increased risk of prostate cancer compared to fathers of singletons; neither for total prostate cancer odds ratio (OR) 0.95(95% CI 0.89-1.02), nor for any risk category, OR 0.97 (95% CI 0.84-1.12) for low-risk disease, and OR 1.04 (95% CI 0.90-1.22) for metastatic disease.\nThe lack of association between fathering of dizygotic twins and prostate cancer risk give no support for an association between male fertility and prostate cancer risk.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of discordant phenotypic sex in monozygotic twins mosaic 47,XXY/46,XX: monozygotic heterokaryotypic twins. The twins presented with cognitive and comprehension delay, behavioural and language disorders, all symptoms frequently reported in Klinefelter syndrome. Molecular zygosity analysis with several markers confirmed that the twins are in effect monozygotic (MZ). Array comparative genomic hybridization found no evidence for the implication of copy number variation in the phenotypes. Ultrasound scans of the reproductive organs revealed no abnormalities. Endocrine tests showed a low testosterone level in Twin 1 (male phenotype) and a low gonadotrophin level in Twin 2 (female phenotype) which, combined with the results from ultrasound examination, provided useful information for potentially predicting the future fertility potential of the twins. Blood karyotypes revealed the presence of a normal 46,XX cell line and an aneuplo\u00efd 47,XXY cell line in both patients. Examination of the chromosome constitutions of various tissues such as blood, buccal smear and urinary sediment not surprisingly showed different proportions for the 46,XX and 47,XXY cell lines, which most likely explains the discordant phenotypic sex and mild Klinefelter features. The most plausible underlying biological mechanism is a post-zygotic loss of the Y chromosome in an initially 47,XXY zygote. This would result in an embryo with both 46,XX and 47,XXY cells lines which could subsequently divide into two monozygotic embryos through a twinning process. The two cell lines would then be distributed differently between tissues which could result in phenotypic discordances in the twins. These observations emphasize the importance of regular paediatric evaluations to determine the optimal timing for fertility preservation measures and to detect new Klinefelter features which could appear throughout childhood in the two subjects.",

    "abstract": "The equal environments assumption (EEA) of the twin method posits that environmental influences that are etiologically relevant to a given phenotype are no more likely to be shared by monozygotic (MZ) than dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. One method of testing the EEA is to evaluate whether increased rearing environment similarity in MZ twin pairs compared to DZ twin pairs is related to increased phenotypic correlation. In a sample of 885 twin pairs, we contrasted similarity in rearing environment between MZ and DZ twin pairs, examined the correlation between similarity in rearing environment and conduct disorder (CD), oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD), inattention, and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptom dimensions, and tested the effects of differential similarity in rearing environments between MZ and DZ twin pairs by testing whether rearing environment similarity moderated the correlations for the externalizing symptom dimensions. We found that MZ twins experienced substantially more similar rearing environments than DZ twins, but that there was little evidence that MZ and DZ correlations for the externalizing symptom dimensions varied by rearing environment similarity. Thus, these results constitute evidence for the validity of the EEA for childhood externalizing disorders.",

    "abstract": "Restrictive feeding is associated with childhood obesity; however, this could be due to other factors that drive children to overeat and parents to restrict (eg, child genetics). Using a twin design to better control for confounders, we tested differences in restrictive feeding within families in relation to differences in twins' self-regulatory eating and weight status.\nSixty-four same-gender twin pairs (4-7 years old) were studied with their mothers. Child caloric compensation ability (COMPX% index) was assessed by using a laboratory-based protocol. The Child Feeding Questionnaire assessed mothers' self-reported feeding styles toward each twin. Child BMI (kg/m(2)) and BMI z score were calculated by using measured weight and height; percent body fat and waist circumference were also assessed. Partial correlations examined within-twin pair differences in Child Feeding Questionnaire subscales in relation to within-twin pair differences in anthropometry and caloric compensation (COMPX%).\nDifferences in maternal restriction were significantly associated with within-pair differences in child COMPX% and BMI z score. Mothers reported more restriction toward the heavier and more poorly compensating twin. Additionally, within-pair differences in parental pressure to eat were associated with significant differences in BMI z score, percent body fat, and waist circumference. Mothers were more pressuring toward the lighter twin.\nMothers vary in their feeding practices, even among same-gender twin pairs, which might influence differences in adiposity. Future research needs to elucidate cause-and-effect and intervention implications regarding parental restriction and pressure-to-eat prompts.",

    "abstract": "Statistical power is one of the major concerns in genetic association studies. Related individuals such as twins are valuable samples for genetic studies because of their genetic relatedness. Phenotype similarity in twin pairs provides evidence of genetic control over the phenotype variation in a population. The genetic association study on human longevity, a complex trait that is under control of both genetic and environmental factors, has been confronted by the small sample sizes of longevity subjects which limit statistical power. Twin pairs concordant for longevity have increased probability for carrying beneficial genes and thus are useful samples for gene-longevity association analysis. We conducted a computer simulation to estimate the power of association study using longevity concordant twin pairs. We observed remarkable power increases in using singletons from longevity concordant twin pairs as cases in comparison with cases of sporadic proband. A similar power would require doubled sample sizes for fraternal twins than for identical twins who are concordant for longevity suggesting that longevity concordant identical twins are more efficient samples than fraternal twins. We also observed an approximate of 2- to 3-fold increase in sample sizes needed for longevity cutoff at age 90 as compared with that at age 95. Overall, our results showed high value of twins in genetic association studies on human longevity.",

    "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease, though the pathophysiologic mechanisms remain unclear. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis. We examined whether PTSD and combat exposure were associated with CIMT in Vietnam War-era twins after controlling for shared genetic and childhood factors. Between 2002 and 2010, we studied 465 middle-aged twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry who were free from cardiovascular disease. PTSD was diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and CIMT was measured by ultrasound. Mixed-effects regression models were used to examine individual, between-pair, and within-pair associations. Approximately 13% of participants met the criteria for PTSD, and 45% served in the Vietnam Theater. PTSD was associated with 32.7 \u03bcm higher CIMT (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9, 64.5) after adjustment for confounders. The average CIMT for the pair increased by 59.7 \u03bcm for each additional twin with PTSD (95% CI: 15.9, 104.2). We found no significant within-pair differences in CIMT when comparing PTSD-discordant co-twins. Results for combat exposure were similar, but its association with CIMT weakened after adjustment for PTSD (95% CI: 7.0, 45.3). Among Vietnam War-era veterans, combat exposure and PTSD are associated with CIMT, though the associations are largely mediated by shared childhood factors.",

The data was obtained from the records of preterm twins born between August 2010 and August 2013. Preterm twins were categorized in two groups: the ones conceived using ART versus those conceived through SC. Demographic characteristics and neonatal outcomes were compared.\nThe total was of 398 patients: 208 conceived in consequence of ART and 190 through SC. The primary outcome and neonatal morbidities showed no significant difference, only the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and the use of parenteral nutrition showed significant difference. The length of hospital stay between groups was similar.\nIn our population of preterm twins, the mode of conception had no detectable effect on mortality or short term morbidities.\nIntroducci\u00f3n: los embarazos gemelares ocurren una vez cada 800 embarazos. Debido al incremento en la edad materna y a la prevalencia de la infertilidad ha aumentado el uso de las t\u00e9cnicas de reproducci\u00f3n asistida (TRA). De los embarazos resueltos por medio de estas t\u00e9cnicas, 35 % son gemelares. Las TRA se definen como tratamientos de infertilidad en los que oocitos y espermatozoides son manipulados. El objetivo de este estudio consisti\u00f3 en comparar el comportamiento cl\u00ednico de los gemelos obtenidos por t\u00e9cnicas de reproducci\u00f3n asistida frente al de los gemelos obtenidos de manera espont\u00e1nea. M\u00e9todos: estudio de cohorte retrolectiva. La informaci\u00f3n se obtuvo de expedientes de pacientes gemelares reci\u00e9n nacidos con 37 semanas de gestaci\u00f3n o menos durante el periodo agosto 2010-2013. La poblaci\u00f3n se dividi\u00f3 en dos grupos: los concebidos por t\u00e9cnicas de reproducci\u00f3n asistida (TRA) y los espont\u00e1neos (CE). Se compararon caracter\u00edsticas demogr\u00e1ficas y resultados neonatales. Resultados: fueron en total 398 pacientes: 208 pacientes por TRA y 190 por CE. De las variables analizadas no existe diferencia significativa entre grupos, \u00fanicamente en enterocolitis necrosante y nutrici\u00f3n parenteral. El n\u00famero de d\u00edas de estancia intrahospitalaria por grupos no tuvo resultados significativos. Conclusi\u00f3n: el modo de concepci\u00f3n no tuvo un efecto detectable en la mortalidad y la morbilidad neonatales.",

We present an uncommon case of a parasitic ischiopagus tetrapus with a parasitic ischiopagus partial twin joined to the complete fetus at the level of the ischium diagnosed in utero by fetal MRI. The correct prenatal diagnosis led to birth by caesarean section. Prenatal MRI findings are presented and corroborated by postnatal imaging delineating the full extent and associated anomalies of this rare malformation. Differential diagnosis of duplicated lower extremities is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Blood vessel resistance is assessed by flow velocity indexes. However, the actual resistance should be more strongly correlated with vessel diameter rather than variations in flow velocity. We aimed to determine the utility of middle cerebral artery (MCA) diameter measurement as a tool for evaluating brain sparing effect in intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) discordant twins.\nTen dichorionic-diamniotic twin pairs with weight discordance were included in the study. Fetal assessment included estimated fetal weight, umbilical artery flow, MCA flow and MCA diameter. Paired statistical analysis was used to compare MCA diameter and MCA pulsatility index (PI) between the discordant twins.\nMCA diameter was significantly larger in the smaller twin (mean diameter 3.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 vs 2.71\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22, P\u2009=\u20090.018, mean ratio 1.39\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14). There was no significant difference in MCA PI values within the twin pairs (mean PI 1.51\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13 vs 1.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07, P\u2009=\u20090.878, mean ratio 0.99\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11).\nMeasurement of MCA diameter can potentially be used as a tool for assessing vessel resistance. Further studies are needed to assess the feasibility and sensitivity of this method as well as the clinical significance of MCA dilatation in the presence of normal Doppler flow indexes.",

    "abstract": "Congenital primary hypothyroidism (CH) is a rare pediatric disorder estimated to occur in about 1:2,500 live births. Approximately half of these cases entail ectopic thyroid tissue, which is believed to result from a migration defect during embryogenesis. Approximately 3% of CH cases are explained by mutation(s) in known genes, most of which are transcription factors implicated in the embryology of the thyroid gland. Surprisingly, monozygotic (MZ) twins are usually discordant for CH due to thyroid dysgenesis, suggesting that most cases are not caused by transmitted genetic variation. One possible explanation is somatic mutation in genes involved in thyroid migration occurring after zygotic twinning. Such mutations should be observed only in the affected twin.\nTo test the hypothesis of somatic mutation, we performed whole exome sequencing of DNA from three pairs of MZ twins discordant for CH with ectopic glands.\nWe found no somatic mutations exclusive to any of the three affected twins or in any of the unaffected twins.\nEither somatic mutations are not significant for the etiology of CH or else such mutations lie outside regions of the genome accessible by exome sequencing technology.",

Alternative G \u00d7 E models have been proposed (i.e., diathesis-stress, differential susceptibility, bioecological), each of which has notably different implications for etiology. Child twin studies present a powerful tool for discriminating between these models. The current study examined whether and how parental involvement moderated etiological influences on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) within 500 twin pairs aged 6-11 years. Results indicated moderation of genetic and nonshared environmental contributions to ADHD by parental involvement, and moreover, suggested both differential susceptibility and bioecological models of G \u00d7 E.

    "abstract": "The aim was to determine whether latitudinal (Queensland versus Tasmania) variation in reported disease frequency in Australia may be biased by differences in population.\nA retrospective analysis was conducted from data of two large Australian twin studies (n = 1,835) having undertaken ophthalmic examination, namely, Twins Eye Study in Tasmania (TEST) and the Brisbane Adolescent Twins Study (BATS). Ordinal logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios and predicted probabilities for each category of eye colour by state.\nTasmanian residence was associated with lower odds of darker iris colour (odds ratio 0.77, 95% CI [0.63-0.95]) signifying that participants living in Tasmania (TAS) are less likely to have darker-coloured irides than those residing in Queensland (QLD). For individuals living in Tasmania the predicted probability (TAS versus QLD) of having light blue eyes was greater (16.7 versus 13.3 per cent), approximately the same for green eyes and less for brown/dark brown-coloured eyes (6.2 versus 7.9 per cent).\nWe found a general trend of individuals living in the southern states (TAS/VIC) of Australia having lighter-coloured irides compared to those living in the north (QLD). This finding has potential implications for all epidemiological research conducted to explore differences in UV-associated disease frequency in Australia, as population heterogeneity may confound the estimates obtained.",

    "abstract": "To compare the different serum peptidome patterns between twins with and without non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in order to help understand the pathogenesis of NAFLD and to identify potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.\nThe peptidomics patterns of 63 cases with NAFLD were compared with their twin healthy controls in Qingdao, China. Peptides between 800 Da and 3,500 Da were captured and concentrated using C18 reversed-phase columns, followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The sequences of peptides associated with NAFLD were further identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF. Further validation studies were conducted. One hundred additional serum samples were detected by commercially available ELISA kits to calculate the concentrations of complement C3f and fibrinopeptide A, respectively. The differences of these two peptides in the NAFLD and control groups were compared using SPSS 17.0, respectively.\nCompared with healthy controls, eleven peaks (861.1, 877.07, 904.5, 1206.57, 1350.64, 1518.7, 1690.9, 1777.94, 2931.29, 3190.4, 3261.4) were up-regulated and 7 peaks (942.44, 1020.47, 1060.06, 1211.7, 1263.63, 1449.76, 2768.3) were down-regulated in the NAFLD group. Two peptides derived from complement C3f and fibrinopeptide A, respectively, had the highest ROC values indistinguishing NAFLD cases from their normal controls. In the validation group, the concentrations of complement C3f and fibrinopeptide A (1466.929 \u00b1 78.306 pg/ml, 4.189 \u00b1 0.326 ng/ml, respevtively) in NAFLD group was higher than in control group (complement C3f 1159.357 \u00b1 99.624 pg/ml, FPA 3.039 \u00b1 0.483 ng/ml; P<0.05).\nIn this study, we established apeptidomics pattern that could help distinguish NAFLD patients from their twin controls. The differently-regulated peptides identified in our study may be potential diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets for NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have reported associations between air pollution exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders in children, but the role of pre- and postnatal exposure has not been elucidated.\nWe aimed to explore the risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among children in relation to pre- and postnatal exposure to air pollution from road traffic.\nParents of 3,426 twins born in Stockholm during 1992-2000 were interviewed, when their children were 9 or 12 years old, for symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders. Residence time-weighted concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter <10 \u03bcm (PM10) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from road traffic were estimated at participants' addresses during pregnancy, the first year, and the ninth year of life using dispersion modeling, controlling for seasonal variation. Multivariate regression models were used to examine the association between air pollution exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes, adjusting for potential confounding factors.\nNo clear or consistent associations were found between air pollution exposure during any of the three time windows and any of the neurodevelopmental outcomes. For example, a 5-95% difference in exposure to NOx during pregnancy was associated with odds ratios (ORs) of 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44-1.96) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.58-1.40) for ASD and ADHD respectively. A corresponding range in exposure to PM10 during pregnancy was related to ORs of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.52-1.96) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.68-1.47) for ASD and ADHD.\nOur data do not provide support for an association between pre- or postnatal exposure to air pollution from road traffic and neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a genetically mediated disease with variable age of onset. In the pediatric age range, nonsyndromic TAA frequently has a milder course than syndromic forms of TAA, such as Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Herein, we describe 17-year-old identical twin brothers with severe progressive TAA due to a novel de novo ACTA2 mutation. Interestingly, both boys were diagnosed at age 11 with congenital mydriasis, a recently recognized manifestation of some ACTA2 mutations due to smooth muscle dysfunction. One of the brothers presented with acute-onset lower back pain that was identified as dissection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Imaging of the chest at this time showed severe fusiform TAA. Cardiac imaging in his twin showed similar TAA, but no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Both brothers underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement, but have had progressive aortic disease with recurrent dissection requiring multiple surgeries. This case emphasizes the importance of identifying physical stigmata of smooth muscle dysfunction, such as mydriasis, as potential markers for associated aortopathy and vascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cases of congenital absence of the cruciate ligaments are seen rarely in the literature. When reported, they are almost exclusively associated with various additional lower extremity deformities. We report the cases of 15-year-old monozygotic twin brothers. Both brothers presented with right knee pain and instability and were found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to have congenital absence of the right anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Examination of full length leg radiographs and MRI of the knee showed no associated abnormalities. Twin B previously underwent partial medial meniscectomy performed by an outside orthopaedic surgeon at which time the absence of the ACL was noted but not repaired. After diagnosis at our practice, both twins underwent arthroscopically assisted ACL construction with bone-patella-bone-autograft. Following recovery from surgery, both twins returned to high level athletics. These cases are among few reports of isolated congenital absence of the ACL, and to our knowledge there are no other cases of isolated congenital absence of the ACL in monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Congenital scoliosis due to vertebral anomalies may occur in less than 0.1% of the population. Several different theories have been put forth in the literature to account for the etiology of congenital scoliosis and the vertebral anomalies which contribute to its development. The study of scoliosis in twins has contributed to the understanding of causative factors including genetics, environment and in utero events during embryologic development. Case reports of fraternal (non-identical) juvenile male twins with congenital scoliosis associated with differing congenital vertebral anomalies are presented. Both children were asymptomatic at the time of the initial consultation and showed no signs of neurologic compromise. Rapidly progressive, severe genetic scoliosis requires prudent observation and referral to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon to determine appropriate options for care and to screen for potentially life threatening disorders. Chiropractors may be seen as gatekeepers for scoliosis and a thorough understanding of appropriate standards of care is required.\nLa scoliose cong\u00e9nitale due \u00e0 des anomalies vert\u00e9brales peut se produire chez moins de 0,1 % de la population. Plusieurs th\u00e9ories diff\u00e9rentes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9es dans la recherche scientifique pour expliquer l\u2019\u00e9tiologie de la scoliose cong\u00e9nitale et les anomalies vert\u00e9brales qui contribuent \u00e0 son d\u00e9veloppement. L\u2019\u00e9tude de la scoliose chez les jumeaux a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension des facteurs \u00e9tiologiques, dont la g\u00e9n\u00e9tique, l\u2019environnement, et les \u00e9v\u00e9nements in utero au cours du d\u00e9veloppement embryonnaire. On pr\u00e9sente des rapports de cas de fr\u00e8res jumeaux (non identiques) mineurs atteints de scoliose cong\u00e9nitale associ\u00e9e \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes anomalies vert\u00e9brales cong\u00e9nitales.

    "abstract": "In April 2009, a female chimpanzee named Sango, living in a captive group at the Noichi Zoo, Japan, gave birth to dizygotic male-female twin chimpanzees (male: Daiya, female: Sakura). The extent to which adult group members cared for the twins was investigated using a focal animal sampling method targeting six adults (one male) when the twin chimpanzees were two years old. Data were collected for an average of 6.78\u2005h (SD = 0.79) per focal participant. An unaffiliated female adult of Sango was engaged in parenting Sakura as much as Sango. Given that Sakura was in lesser proximity to Sango than Daiya, Sakura's departures from her mother and her ability to gesture requests might have enabled non-kin adults to provide her care.",

    "abstract": "Common obesity is a result of interaction between genes and environmental/lifestyle factors, with heritability estimates 40-70%. Not only the susceptibility to obesity but also the success of weight management depends on the genetic background of each individual. This paper summarizes the up-to-date knowledge on genetic causes of common obesities. Introduction of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) led to an identification of a total of 32 variants associated with obesity/BMI and 14 with body fat distribution. Further, a great progress in revealing the mechanisms regulating the energy balance was also noted. However, the proportion of explained variance for BMI is still low, suggesting other mechanisms such as gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, rare gene variants, copy number variants polymorphisms, or epigenetic modifications and microRNAs regulating gene transcription. In summary, we present results of our studies on obesity risk variants in Czech adults, children and adolescents including those evaluating the influence of selected gene variants on the outcomes of weight management.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of non-identical twins who presented with identical neonatal intestinal obstruction with features of anorectal stenosis, presacral mass and sacral anomaly consistent with Currarino's syndrome or triad. Plain sacral radiograph, contrast enema and MRI were diagnostic. Initial management involved a defunctioning colostomy followed by a posterior sagittal anorectoplasty with excision of the teratoma \u00b1 anterior sacral meningocele and finally closure of colostomy in a staged multidisciplinary approach. The twins' father is also affected with features of Currarino's syndrome but was diagnosed during family screening. Currarino's syndrome presenting with identical neonatal low intestinal obstruction in a non-identical set of twins is rare and interesting. Antenatal diagnosis of Currarino's syndrome is difficult and may prove to be a challenge even in the postnatal period. Sacral spine radiograph, contrast enema and MRI are diagnostic. Management requires high index of suspicion, low threshold for MRI and multidisciplinary staged approach.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to quantify the genetic and environmental contributions to oral disease and function in twins. Participants were middle-aged and old twins, 116 monozygotic and 16 dizygotic pairs whose mean age was 66\u00b71 \u00b1 10\u00b73 (SD) years. Number of teeth, percentage of decayed, filled and missing teeth and periodontal status were recorded as indicators of oral disease. The widths of upper and lower dental arch served as indicators of morphological figures. Furthermore, stimulated salivary flow rate, occlusal force and masticatory performance were measured as indicators of oral function. Univariate genetic analysis with monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs was conducted to detect the fittest structural equation model of each outcome. Both number of teeth and periodontal status fitted the model composed of common environmental factor and unique environmental factor. Decayed, filled and missing teeth, morphological figures and measurements of oral function fitted the model composed of additive genetic factor and unique environmental factor. The model fitting of each measurement suggested that periodontal disease was mainly affected by environmental factors, while morphological figures and oral functions were influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Microdeletion and microduplication syndromes without characteristic dysmorphic features are difficult to diagnose without chromosomal microarrays.\nWe describe the clinical course and genetic findings of monozygotic twins with intellectual disabilities and autistic features associated with mild facial dysmorphism and microdeletion of chromosome 3p14.\nThe postnatal course of the second twin was complicated by intestinal malrotation, whereas that of the first twin was unremarkable. Both twins had several mild dysmorphic features including upswept frontal hair, low-set posterior rotated ears, arched down-slanting eyebrows, prominent forehead, epicanthic folds, micrognathia, hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, short philtrum, and camptodactyly of the bilateral fifth fingers. They had autistic features such as poor eye contact and no social smile, stereotyped behaviors, and preference for solitary play. Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed de novo 6.88-Mb deletions of 3p14 (chr3: 60,472,496-67,385,119) involving 17 genes in both twins. The deleted region contained 17 genes, five of which are known or presumed to be related to central nervous system disorders: FEZF2, SYNPR, ATXN7, PRICKLE2, and MAGI1.\nWe consider that PRICKLE2 is the most likely causative gene for the autistic features exhibited by these individuals.",

    "abstract": "We consider data from the Danish twin registry and aim to study in detail how lifetimes for twin-pairs are correlated. We consider models where we specify the marginals using a regression structure, here Cox's regression model or the additive hazards model. The best known such model is the Clayton-Oakes model. This model can be extended in several directions. One extension is to allow the dependence parameter to depend on covariates. Another extension is to model dependence via piecewise constant cross-hazard ratio models. We show how both these models can be implemented for large sample data, and suggest a computational solution for obtaining standard errors for such models for large registry data. In addition we consider alternative models that have some computational advantages and with different dependence parameters based on odds ratios of the survival function using the Plackett distribution. We also suggest a way of assessing how and if the dependence is changing over time, by considering either truncated or right-censored versions of the data to measure late or early dependence. This can be used for formally testing if the dependence is constant, or decreasing/increasing. The proposed procedures are applied to Danish twin data to describe dependence in the lifetimes of the twins. Here we show that the early deaths are more correlated than the later deaths, and by comparing MZ and DZ associations we suggest that early deaths might be more driven by genetic factors. This conclusion requires models that are able to look at more local dependence measures. We further show that the dependence differs for MZ and DZ twins and appears to be the same for males and females, and that there are indications that the dependence increases over calendar time.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often occur together. To obtain more insight in potential causes for the co-occurrence, this study examined the genetic and environmental etiology of the association between specific ASD and ADHD disorder dimensions. Self-reported data on ASD dimensions social and communication difficulties (ASDsc), and repetitive and restricted behavior and interests (ASDr), and ADHD dimensions inattention (IA), and hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI) were assessed in a community sample of 17,770 adult Swedish twins. Phenotypic, genetic and environmental associations between disorder dimensions were examined in a multivariate model, accounting for sex differences. ASDr showed the strongest associations with IA and HI in both sexes (r(p) 0.33 to 0.40). ASDsc also correlated moderately with IA (females r(p) 0.29 and males r(p) 0.35) but only modestly with HI (females r(p) 0.17 and males r(p) 0.20). Genetic correlations ranged from 0.22 to 0.64 and were strongest between ASDr and IA and HI. Sex differences were virtually absent. The ASDr dimension (reflecting restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests and activities) showed the strongest association with dimensions of ADHD, on a phenotypic, genetic and environmental level. This study opens new avenues for molecular genetic research. As our findings demonstrated that genetic overlap between disorders is dimension-specific, future gene-finding studies on psychiatric comorbidity should focus on carefully selected genetically related dimensions of disorders.",

    "abstract": "To assess the relative effect of birth weight and gestational age on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) using preterm twin pairs discordant for birth weigh in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit in China.\nFifty-six discordant twin pairs of 112 preterm infants were retrospectively analyzed. The twin pairs were divided into two subgroups based on birth weight in each pair. The occurrence of ROP and severe ROP requiring treatment were compared between the lower birth weight infants and their co-twins with the higher birth weight. Some neonatal morbidities related to prematurity and neonatal characteristics were also compared between the twin pairs.\nBased on the univariate analysis, gestational age and birth weight were significantly associated with the occurrence and progression of ROP. But no significant differences in ROP between larger and smaller infants were observed in the twin-paired analysis. The incidence of neonatal morbidities regarding respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), sepsis and neonatal characteristics regarding gender distribution, one- and five-minute Apgar score, postnatal steroid treatment, blood transfusion, supplemental oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation were not different between the twins. However, gestational age of \u226428wk was significantly associated with significantly higher rates of ROP and severe ROP.\nGestational age is a better predictor of ROP than birth weight in the twin-paired study.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption is influenced by heritable factors. The genetic influence on usual high-density drinking, including alcohol intoxication and hangover, is unknown. We aim to estimate the heritability of usual high-density drinking.\nA total of 13,511 male twins in this cross-sectional study were included from the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC) Twin Registry. Data on the frequency of alcohol intoxication and alcohol hangover over the past year, that is, usual high-density drinking (phenotypes), were collected through a self-administered questionnaire when twins were middle-aged in 1972. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the variance components of phenotypes.\nThe mean of the frequency of usual high-density drinking in the entire twin population was 0.16 times per month for intoxication and 0.18 times per month for hangover. The heritability of usual alcohol intoxication was 50.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 46.2 to 55.0) before and 49.9% (95% CI 45.3 to 54.2) after the body mass index (BMI) adjustment. The heritability of usual hangover was 55.4% (95% CI 51.2 to 58.6) before and 54.8% (95% CI 50.6 to 58.8) after adjustment for BMI. Unshared environmental factors between co-twins explained the remaining variance in alcohol intoxication and in hangover.\nBoth genetic and unshared environmental factors have important influences on usual alcohol intoxication and hangover. These findings are important in understanding the occurrence of and developing interventions for usual high-density drinking.",

    "abstract": "To describe neonatal and obstetrical prognosis in dichorionic (DC) twins with a birth weight discordance under 20% and evaluate the influence of intrauterine growth restriction on the management.\nWe studied retrospectively 67 DC twins birth between July 2002 and July 2012 at our university labour ward. Birth weight discordance was considered slight between 20-25%, moderate between 25-30%, and severe over 30%.\nPrevalence of birth weight discordance in DC twins is estimated at 11.4% in our study. Eighty percent of severe discordance was diagnosed before delivery, 41% for moderate discordance and 20% for slight discordance. We note 30% of pre eclampsia in our population with 44% in the severe discordance group. Mean gestational age was 35.1 weeks for slight and moderate discordances, and 33 weeks for severe discordance. Caesarean section rate was 48% for severe discordance and only 36% for slight discordance. Vaginal delivery rate is 56.7%. More than half of patient with a severe discordance gave birth vaginally. Intrauterine growth restriction rate under the 10th percentile was 18.7%. Prevalence of IUGR was 24% in sever discordance group, 23.5% in the moderate discordance group and 10% in the slight group. Neonatal morbidity rate was 20.8% mainly in children with IUGR.\nNeonatal mortality and morbidity rate are mainly increased in severe discordant twins. These pregnancies are at high risk of maternal morbidity. Vaginal delivery must be preferred for slight and moderate discordances. In case of severe discordance, vaginal delivery should be considered depending on the degree of intrauterine growth retardation.",

    "abstract": "A 7-year-old child presented with atypical absence epilepsy. He also had autism and severe cognitive deficit. As part of his diagnostic workup, a chromosomal microarray analysis was performed, which showed novel biallelic deletions in the neurexin 1 gene (NRXN1). His fraternal twin sister, who also had autism and cognitive impairment, was subsequently found to have the same biallelic deletions. Deletions included a 272-282kb loss at band 2p16.3 in one allele and a smaller 135-174-kb loss on the second allele. Neurexin 1 (NRXN1) is a cell adhesion protein, forming a synaptic complex with neuroligin. This signals a pathway that is critical for activity-dependent synaptic transmission. Mutations in this gene have been associated with autism and neurodevelopmental delay. Although there are many reports of heterozygous mutations with variable expressivity, only 3 cases with biallelic NRXN1 mutations have been previously reported, all of which have a more severe phenotype. We report 2 siblings with biallelic deletions, both of which affect the promoter region and exons 1-5 in the \u03b1-NRXN1 isoform, which has a role in the Ca(2+)-dependent release of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Our cases expand the phenotype of biallelic \u03b1 NRXN 1 mutations and emphasize the important role of NRXN1 in autism and intellectual disability. Chromosomal microarray analysis should be the clinical standard in all specialties for first-tier genetic testing in autistic spectrum disorders.",

    "abstract": "The innate immune response from diamniotic and dichorionic twin brothers congenitally infected with Trypanosoma. cruzi (strain DTU-V) who displayed different clinical symptomatology was studied. While Brother I manifested severe cardiac and digestive disorders, the Brother II showed slight splenomegaly. The secretion level of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, IL-10, IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 cytokines produced after stimulation of peripheral blood cells with TLR-2, TLR-4 and TLR-9 ligands was determined pre- and post-benznidazole treatment. Cells from 10 uninfected infants born to mothers seropositive for Chagas disease were included as control. The obtained data show that the cells of Brother I secreted lower levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (upon TLR-2 and TLR-4 stimulation) relative to those secreted by cells from Brother II and uninfected controls. The cells from Brother II secreted high levels of the IL-1\u03b2 cytokine following TLR-2 stimulation relative to uninfected controls. The cells from both brothers secreted a higher level of IL-6, following TLR-4 stimulation, than that secreted by uninfected infant cells. After treatments, the cytokine secretion levels were similar in both children and comparable to those of uninfected donors. Treatment success in Brother I and treatment interruption in Brother II was detected by the use of serological biomarkers (KMP11, HSP70, PFR2, Tgp63) as well as follow-up done by PCR. Therefore, the Brother II required a second treatment. The data presented suggest that benznidazol treatment allows the innate immune system to reach a fully functional status similar to that of uninfected subjects.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have identified the relationship between parental loss and psychopathology later in life. However, this relationship varied depending on the kind of loss, the parent involved, and the type of psychopathology. In the present study, we examined the association between parental loss (any loss, death, and separation) during childhood and lifetime risk for seven common psychiatric and substance use disorders in a sample of 2605 male twins from the Virginia population-based twin registry. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we also examined the extent to which the influence of parental loss contributes to adult psychopathology. Parental separation was associated with a wide range of adult psychopathology, whereas parental death was specifically associated with phobia and alcohol dependence. Maternal and paternal separations were almost equally associated with most forms of psychopathology. SEM suggested that parental loss accounted for about 10% of the variance of adult psychopathology, of which parental separation had the strongest impacts on risk for depression and drug abuse/dependence (11% of the total variance). Our findings suggest that early parental separation has stronger and wider effects on adult psychopathology than parental death.",

    "abstract": "The present study aims to analyze perinatal outcomes in twins given special care during pregnancy and labor and to compare fetal and neonatal outcomes in dichorionic twins with monochorionic twins.\nEighty eight (88) twin pregnancies booked for care at a tertiary care Fetal Medicine centre were included in this study. The maternal demographic variables, course of pregnancy, fetal problems, and specialized fetal therapeutic and diagnostic interventions were noted. The above parameters were compared in the sub-groups of dichorionic and monochorionic twin pregnancies and related to the perinatal outcome. Statistical analysis was done using the student's t test and the two-tailed chi sqaure tests with Yate's continuity correction. A p value <0.05 was considered as significant.\nMean maternal age was 30.34\u00a0+\u00a04.81\u00a0years (range 19-48). 81\u00a0% of the twins were DCDA, and 19\u00a0% were MCDA. The mean gestational age at delivery was 34.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00a0weeks, and this was not significantly different in MCDA and DCDA groups. Serious fetal problems warranting intervention at the time of initial referral were significantly higher in MCDA twins although overall perinatal outcome in both groups were not different.\nSpecialized care during pregnancy and labor including active fetal surveillance and therapeutic intervention when indicated improves the perinatal outcome in twin pregnancies and ensured at least one healthy live birth in over 90\u00a0% cases, although with an increase in late prematurity.",

    "abstract": "Head motion (HM) is a critical confounding factor in functional MRI. Here we investigate whether HM during resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) is influenced by genetic factors in a sample of 462 twins (65% female; 101 MZ (monozygotic) and 130 DZ (dizygotic) twin pairs; mean age: 21 (SD = 3.16), range 16-29). Heritability estimates for three HM components-mean translation (MT), maximum translation (MAXT) and mean rotation (MR)-ranged from 37 to 51%. We detected a significant common genetic influence on HM variability, with about two-thirds (genetic correlations range 0.76-1.00) of the variance shared between MR, MT and MAXT. A composite metric (HM-PC1), which aggregated these three, was also moderately heritable (h(2) = 42%). Using a sub-sample (N = 35) of the twins we confirmed that mean and maximum translational and rotational motions were consistent \"traits\" over repeated scans (r = 0.53-0.59); reliability was even higher for the composite metric (r = 0.66). In addition, phenotypic and cross-trait cross-twin correlations between HM and resting state functional connectivities (RS-FCs) with Brodmann areas (BA) 44 and 45, in which RS-FCs were found to be moderately heritable (BA44: h(2) = 0.23 (sd = 0.041), BA45: h(2) = 0.26 (sd = 0.061)), indicated that HM might not represent a major bias in genetic studies using FCs. Even so, the HM effect on FC was not completely eliminated after regression. HM may be a valuable endophenotype whose relationship with brain disorders remains to be elucidated.",

    "abstract": "Based on evidence linking creativity and bipolar disorder, a model has been proposed whereby factors influencing liability to bipolar disorder confer certain traits with positive effects on reproductive fitness. The authors tested this model by examining key traits known to be associated with evolutionary fitness, namely, temperament and neurocognition, in individuals carrying liability for bipolar disorder. Schizophrenia probands and their co-twins were included as psychiatric controls.\nTwin pairs discordant for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and control pairs were identified through the Swedish Twin Registry. The authors administered a neuropsychological test battery and temperament questionnaires to samples of bipolar probands, bipolar co-twins, schizophrenia probands, schizophrenia co-twins, and controls. Multivariate mixed-model analyses of variance were conducted to compare groups on temperament and neurocognitive scores.\nBipolar co-twins showed elevated scores on a \"positivity\" temperament scale compared with controls and bipolar probands, while bipolar probands scored higher on a \"negativity\" scale compared with their co-twins and controls, who did not differ. Additionally, bipolar co-twins showed superior performance compared with controls on tests of verbal learning and fluency, while bipolar probands showed performance decrements across all neurocognitive domains. In contrast, schizophrenia co-twins showed attenuated impairments in positivity and overall neurocognitive functioning relative to their ill proband counterparts.\nThese findings suggest that supra-normal levels of sociability and verbal functioning may be associated with liability for bipolar disorder. These effects were specific to liability for bipolar disorder and did not apply to schizophrenia. Such benefits may provide a partial explanation for the persistence of bipolar illness in the population.",

    "abstract": "Objective. Our objective was to estimate degree and rate of discordant growth and its impact on perinatal outcome in dichorionic twin pregnancies conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) compared to those conceived spontaneously. Study Design. Growth discordance was defined as 90th percentiles for the study population. Adverse perinatal outcome was defined as 5-minute Apgar score <7 and/or admission to neonatal intensive care unit. Results. In the total study population of dichorionic twins (176 conceived by IVF and 215 spontaneously), 30% discordant growth represented the 90th percentile. After adjusting for gestational age, discordant twins conceived by IVF or spontaneously were at higher risk for adverse perinatal outcome (hazard ratio 4.4; 95% CI 2.4-8.3, P < 0.0001; hazard ratio 2.5; 95% CI 1.5-4.4, P = 0.001, resp.). Similar rates of 5-minute Apgar score <7, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, and delivery <34 weeks were found between discordant twins conceived by IVF and those conceived spontaneously. Conclusion. Dichorionic twins conceived by IVF are at similar risk for the rate and degree of discordant growth and adverse perinatal outcome compared to dichorionic twins conceived spontaneously.",

    "abstract": "We present clinical, neuropathological, and molecular genetic findings of a family with a new pain phenotype of the sodium channel gene SCN9A polymorphism R1150W. A 46-year-old woman presented with a 5-year history of episodic temperature- and exercise-dependent burning pain of the feet and lower legs associated with numbness of the distal upper and lower limbs. Her monozygotic twin sister and their mother and her twin presented similar symptoms. Clinical evaluation was normal except for a mild distal sensory deficit in fingers and feet. Electrophysiological testing was unremarkable, as were serum and cerebrospinal fluid laboratory findings. Skin biopsies of the distal lower limbs revealed an epidermal nerve fiber density at the lower limit of normal. Myelinated dermal nerve fibers showed elongated nodes of Ranvier, but normal distribution of nodal and paranodal proteins. Genetic testing for ion channel-associated pain disorders revealed an amino acid R1150W substitution of the Nav1.7 sodium channel. The combination of a Nav1.7 polymorphism with dysmyelinating features in small-caliber peripheral nerves has not been described before and may suggest an explanation for the clinical syndrome in our patients. Treatment with the sodium channel blocker lamotrigine provided some relief, consistent with a role of sodium channel dysfunction in the pain syndrome of this family.",

    "abstract": "Aiming to perform the first sociological survey of Hungarian twins, our main question was whether being a twin has positive consequences on one's life. Adult twins completed our questionnaire at three Hungarian summer twin festivals, in hospitals during medical twin studies, and on some websites online. Data represent 140 twin pairs (mean age: 38.2 \u00b1 14.6 years). We employed some indices for measuring the resource nature of twinship. Three main types of benefits were distinguished: profit of attraction, as 'material capital'; the easier obtainability of cultural goods when twins take part in it, as 'cultural capital'; and positive aspects of an a priori existing dyadic relation, as 'relational capital'. We were interested in the difference among types of twins regarding advantages. We paid special attention to the five groups of twins derived from gender and zygosity (i.e., monozygotic females, monozygotic males, dizygotic females, dizygotic males, opposite-sex pairs). Our analysis showed that Hungarian twins involved in our research basically enjoy their twinship; during their lives they used and still make use of different benefits given by it. In our twin samples, women had more advantages from being a twin than men. Significant differences could be observed on all indicators between monozygotic and dizygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed at investigating the impact of late prematurity (LPT) on neonatal outcome in twins and neonatal morbidity and mortality within LPT with regard to the completed weeks of gestation. The study was conducted in six tertiary obstetric departments from different provinces of Poland (Warsaw, Lublin, Poznan, Wroclaw, Bytom). It included 465 twin deliveries in the above centers in 2012. A comparative analysis of maternal factors, the course of pregnancy and delivery and neonatal outcome between LPT (34 + 0-36 + 6 weeks of gestation) and term groups (completed 37 weeks) was performed. The neonatal outcome included short-term morbidities. The analysis of neonatal complication rates according to completed gestational weeks was carried out. Out of 465 twin deliveries 213 (44.8%) were LPT and 156 (33.55%) were term. There were no neonatal deaths among LPT and term twins. One-third of LPT newborns suffered from respiratory disorders or required antibiotics, 40% had jaundice requiring phototherapy, and 30% were admitted to NICU. The analysis of neonatal morbidity with regard to each gestational week at delivery showed that most analyzed complications occurred less frequently with the advancing gestational age, especially respiratory disorders and NICU admissions. The only two factors with significant influence on neonatal morbidity rate were neonatal birth weight (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.2-0.9, p = .02) and gestational age at delivery (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.5-0.8, p < .01). LPT have a higher risk of neonatal morbidity than term twins. Gestational age and neonatal birth weight seem to play a crucial role in neonatal outcome in twins.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a set of diseases that exhibit not only genetic mutations but also a profoundly distorted epigenetic landscape. Over the last two decades, great advances have been made in identifying these alterations and their importance in the initiation and progression of cancer. Epigenetic changes can be seen from the very early stages in tumorigenesis and dysregulation of the epigenome has an increasingly acknowledged pathogenic role. Epigenomic twin studies have great potential to contribute to our understanding of complex diseases, such as cancer. This is because the use of monozygotic twins discordant for cancer enables epigenetic variation analysis without the confounding influence of the constitutive genetic background, age or cohort effects. It therefore allows the identification of susceptibility loci that may be sensitive to modification by the environment. These studies into cancer etiology will potentially lead to robust epigenetic markers for the detection and risk assessment of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Numerous theoretical reasons have been posited about why more schooling might improve health. Adult health outcomes and behaviors generally are significantly associated with schooling. However, such associations do not necessarily imply that schooling has causal effects on health outcomes and behaviors. Causal estimates based on schooling variation from policies and from within-MZ (monozygotic) twins have reached mixed conclusions. This study contributed new estimates of cross-sectional associations and within-MZ causal effects using three relatively large US twins samples. The estimates suggested that schooling was significantly associated with numerous health outcomes and behaviors. However, with within-MZ twins control for unobserved factors, schooling was no longer associated with most indicators of better health (with the exception of self-reported health), while it continued to be associated with outcomes such as fertility and spousal schooling. Similar patterns were observed for spousal schooling.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of twins with epilepsy to explore the genetic architecture of specific epilepsies, to evaluate the applicability of the 2010 International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) organization of epilepsy syndromes, and to integrate molecular genetics with phenotypic analyses.\nA total of 558 twin pairs suspected to have epilepsy were ascertained from twin registries (69%) or referral (31%). Casewise concordance estimates were calculated for epilepsy syndromes. Epilepsies were then grouped according to the 2010 ILAE organizational scheme. Molecular genetic information was utilized where applicable.\nOf 558 twin pairs, 418 had confirmed seizures. A total of 534 twin individuals were affected. There were higher twin concordance estimates for monozygotic (MZ) than for dizygotic (DZ) twins for idiopathic generalized epilepsies (MZ = 0.77; DZ = 0.35), genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (MZ = 0.85; DZ = 0.25), and focal epilepsies (MZ = 0.40; DZ = 0.03). Utilizing the 2010 ILAE scheme, the twin data clearly demonstrated genetic influences in the syndromes designated as genetic. Of the 384 tested twin individuals, 10.9% had mutations of large effect in known epilepsy genes or carried validated susceptibility alleles.\nTwin studies confirm clear genetic influences for specific epilepsies. Analysis of the twin sample using the 2010 ILAE scheme strongly supported the validity of grouping the \"genetic\" syndromes together and shows this organizational scheme to be a more flexible and biologically meaningful system than previous classifications. Successful selected molecular testing applied to this cohort is the prelude to future large-scale next-generation sequencing of epilepsy research cohorts. Insights into genetic architecture provided by twin studies provide essential data for optimizing such approaches.",

    "abstract": "Advances in developmental biology have shown that monozygous twins may not be as phenotypically identical as once believed, and the mechanisms responsible for such differences are now becoming clearer. Whether such phenotypic differences are capable of triggering graft rejection of an organ transplanted between identical twins remains unknown but the risks seem low, and long-term transplant outcome is excellent. Available evidence to guide immunosuppressive therapy in this setting is limited but a prudent approach would include the use of steroids together with a calcineurin inhibitor after transplantation. However, once the inevitable inflammatory response associated with transplant surgery has resolved, cautious reduction and eventually withdrawal of immunosuppression should be possible.",

The objective refraction was -6.50 DS -2.00 DC \u00d7 180 (right eye), -1.00 DS (left eye) for the first twin; -13.75 DS -2.25 DC \u00d7 180 (right eye), -0.50 DS -0.75 DC \u00d7 04 (left eye) for the second twin. This case suggests an underlying genetic defect in the development of myopia.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to the postnatal period, little is known about telomere length (TL) during prenatal life. The decrease in placental TL remains unknown, although intra uterine growth retardation and preeclampsia are associated with shorter placental TL. The aim of this study is to assess the decrease of placental TL during the third trimester of gestation and to explore the role of potential \"growth influencing factors\".\nThe study sample consisted of 329 live-born twins from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. TL was determined using a multiplex quantitative PCR method. Gestational age, sex, birth order, placental characteristics, parity, maternal and paternal age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, alcohol use, and socio economic status (SES) were considered \"growth influencing factors\". Bivariable multilevel regression analysis with \"growth influencing factors\" was performed.\nPlacental TL ranged from 4.3\u00a0kbp to 84.4\u00a0kbp with a median of 10.8\u00a0kbp. Ln(TL) decreased in a linear fashion with an estimated TL decreasing from 13.98\u00a0kbp at 28 weeks to 10.56\u00a0kbp at 42 weeks. The regression coefficient of gestational age became smaller if considered together with SES (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.017; p\u00a0=\u00a00.08) or diabetes (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.018; p\u00a0=\u00a00.07) and bigger if considered together with parity (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.022; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), indicating that part of the association between gestational age and telomere length is explained by these three confounding factors.\nPlacental TL decreases during the third trimester of gestation of live-born twins with approximately 25% indicating that telomere shortening may play a role in aging of the placenta.",

The work done at the University focuses primarily on the origins of individual differences in temperament and other personality traits. In particular, research is directed toward the traits postulated in the Regulative Theory of Temperament. We also focused on the heritability of socio-political attitudes, risk factors for human health, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The majority of the research that has been carried out is grounded in twin and family studies, although recent work based on molecular techniques has also been developed.

    "abstract": "Compared with singletons, what is the parent mental health, parent-child and couple relationship satisfaction, and child adjustment of 6- to 12-year-old assisted reproduction technology (ART) twins and their families?\nThere are no differences between 6- and 12-year-old ART twin and singleton families in parent mental health or family relationships; however, twins had significantly fewer behavior and attention problems than singletons in middle childhood.\nWhen ART twins are younger than 5 years old, parents have more mental health difficulties and poorer parent-child relationship quality, and no differences have been found in ART twin and singletons' psychosocial adjustment. However, studies have only examined the implications of ART twin status in families with infant and toddler aged children.\nA cross-sectional study of 300 6-12-year-old ART children (n = 124 twins and n = 176 singletons) from 206 families at a reproductive endocrinology clinic in the USA.\nPatients from one clinic with a child born between 1998 and 2004 were invited to participate in an online survey (82% recruitment rate). Participants provided information on each 6- to 12-year-old ART child in the family, and responded to questions on parent mental health, family relationships and child adjustment.\nThere were no differences in parent mental health or family relationships in families with 6- to 12-year-old ART twins versus singletons. However, twins (M = 2.40, SE = 0.35) had significantly fewer behavior problems than singletons (M = 3.47, SE = 0.36; F(1, 201) = 4.54, b = 1.08, P < 0.05). Twins (M = 1.86, SD = 0.23) also had fewer attention problems than singletons (M = 2.64, SD = 0.23; F(1, 156) = 5.75, b = 0.78, P < 0.05). Results also suggest that full-term twins had significantly fewer attention problems (M = 1.37, SE = 0.33; F(1, 222) = 2.65, P = 0.05) than premature twins (M = 2.32, SE = 0.32, b = 0.95, P < 0.05), full-term singletons (M = 2.25, SE = 0.21, b = 0.88, P < 0.05) and premature singletons (M = 2.84, SE = 0.49, b = 1.47, P = 0.01). There were no significant differences between the other groups.\nAlthough the response rate is high (82%) and family demographics are representative of US ART patients, patients are from one US clinic. Responses also are from one family member and may be subject to social desirability biases. Additionally, our data did not include identification of monozygotic and dizygotic twins.\nStudies on infant and toddler ART twins suggest these families have parents with more mental health difficulties and lower parent-child relationship quality than singleton families. This study indicates the negative effects of twin status may have ameliorated by middle childhood, and twins may even have more optimum psychosocial adjustment than singletons in this developmental period.\nThis research is based on a collaborative research effort supported by University of Minnesota Agriculture Experiment Station Project Number MN-52-107, a University of Minnesota Grant-in-Aid of Research, Artistry and Scholarship grant, a University of Minnesota College of Education and Human Development Research Development Investment Grant and the M.

    "abstract": "Because of lack of evidence, we aimed to examine to what degree low-grade systemic inflammation and coronary heart disease (CHD) death shared common genetic and environmental substrates.\nFrom the 41-year prospective National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Twin Study, we included 950 middle-aged male twins at baseline (1969-1973). Low-grade systemic inflammation was measured with plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein. Univariate and bivariate structural equation models were used, adjusted for a risk score for CHD death. The score-adjusted heritability was 19% for IL-6, 27% for C-reactive protein, and 22% for CHD death. The positive phenotypic correlation of IL-6 with CHD death (radjusted=0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08-0.43) was driven by additive genetic factors (contribution [relative contribution], 0.30 [111%]) but attenuated by unique environment (-0.03 [-11%]). The genetic correlation between IL-6 and CHD death was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.21-1.00), whereas the unique environmental correlation was -0.05 (95% CI, -0.35 to 0.25). The proportion of genetic variance for CHD death shared with that for IL-6 was 74%. The phenotypic correlation of C-reactive protein with CHD death (radjusted=0.10; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.22) was explained by additive genetic factors (0.20 [149%]) but was attenuated by the unique environment (-0.09 [-49%]). The genetic correlation of C-reactive protein with CHD death was 0.63 (95% CI, -0.07 to 1.00), whereas the unique environmental correlation was -0.07 (95% CI, -0.29 to 0.17).\nLow-grade systemic inflammation, measured by IL-6, and long-term CHD death share moderate genetic substrates that augment both traits.",

    "abstract": "Until recently, all twin pregnancies were treated in a similar fashion. Ultrasounds were undertaken every 3 to 4 weeks to assess serial fetal growth. Monochorionic (MC) twins comprise only 20% of all twin pregnancies yet unique complications such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence, twin anemia-polycythemia sequence, and selective intrauterine growth restriction can occur. In addition, the in utero death of one twin of a MC pair poses significant risks for death or severe neurologic morbidity in the cotwin. With the exception of discordant growth, these complications are not seen in dichorionic twinning due to the lack of placental anastomoses. In the last two decades, new technologies such as laser photocoagulation for the treatment of severe TTTS and radiofrequency ablation and bipolar cautery for selective reduction have markedly improved outcomes for many of the complications of MC twins. Thus, stratification of \"low-risk\" twinning (dichorionic twins) versus \"high-risk\" twinning (MC twins) is paramount to improved outcomes. This can be easily and accurately accomplished with first trimester ultrasound by evaluating the interface of the intertwin membrane with the placenta. This should now be the standard of care for all multiple gestations.",

    "abstract": "Identical Caucasian male twins, previously fit, presented 1\u2005week apart with short histories of fever and lethargy. The twins were febrile at presentation with profound pancytopaenia and evidence of haemolysis. There was no rash or arthralgia. Both required multiple red cell transfusions. The twins had positive IgM serology for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and parvovirus B19. EBV viral capsid antigen and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen IgGs were also positive however, suggesting past EBV exposure. Parvovirus B19 DNA was detected from peripheral blood PCR; CMV and EBV DNA PCRs were negative. Convalescent serology demonstrated no evolution of the CMV serological response, that is no IgG to CMV developed which implies an initial non-specific polyclonal IgM response. The twins recovered fully over 7\u2005days, the first with a course of prednisolone and the second spontaneously. They were diagnosed with hereditary spherocytosis on convalescent blood films. On further questioning, a family history of hereditary spherocytosis was eventually revealed. The twins' maternal grandmother was known to have the condition asymptomatically. Their mother had prior to this never been tested, but later bloods would reveal a compatible biochemical picture.",

This twin probably had little or no urine output in utero, but still had normal lung development due to production of adequate amniotic fluid by the healthy twin preventing pulmonary hypoplasia. The discordance between monozygotic twins for VATER association indicates that factors other than inherited genetic ones may have a role in the causation of this association.",

    "abstract": "To determine the heritability of spine curve using plain radiographs and to identify risk factors for spine curvature including age, body mass index, smoking, bone mineral density (BMD), and lumbar disc degeneration (LDD).\nA classical twin study of 110 MZ and 136 DZ adult female twins. Demographic and clinical information obtained from long spine radiographs, lumbar spine degeneration on spine MR scan, and BMD assessed by DEXA at hip and lumbar spine were included in multiple logistic regression models to determine risk factors for spine curvature.\nHeritability estimates ranged between 41 (19-59) % for pelvic incidence to 61 (46-72) % for thoracic kyphosis; with lumbar lordosis and cervical lordosis having 59 (42-71) % and 43 (23-59) % heritability, respectively. For each spine curve, the model showing the best fit contained additive genetic and shared environmental components with no contribution from the unique environment. Significant risk factors for increased thoracic kyphosis were lumbar spine BMD, age, and cervical lordosis; for pelvic incidence were lumbar spine BMD and lumbar lordosis; for lumbar lordosis were cervical lordosis, pelvic incidence and LDD; and age alone predicted cervical lordosis (p = 0.001).\nIn this sample of middle-aged and elderly women, there were significant genetic influences on all spine curves but particularly thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis. The strongest predictor for lumbar lordosis was LDD (p < 0.0001) which is itself genetically determined in part. For thoracic kyphosis, BMD was strongly associated and remained so (for lumbar BMD) with the inclusion of age, showing BMD to be an independent risk factor.

Ultrasound (US) examinations were performed twice weekly. The presence of cord entanglement, umbilical artery notch, abnormal Doppler parameters, a non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern, or an abnormal fetal biophysical profile were evaluated.\nUmbilical cord entanglement was observed on US in all pregnancies. The presence of an umbilical artery notch was noted in four out of six pregnancies and in two of them an umbilical artery notch was seen in both twins. The umbilical artery pulsatility index was normal in all fetuses. Doppler parameters of the middle cerebral artery and ductus venosus, fetal biophysical profile and fetal heart rate monitoring remained normal until delivery in all pregnancies. All neonates experienced morbidity related to prematurity; however, all were discharged home in good condition.\nThe presence of an umbilical artery notch and cord entanglement, without other signs of fetal deterioration, are not indicative of an adverse perinatal outcome.",

    "abstract": "Evidence from twin studies points to substantial environmental influences on intelligence, but the specifics of this influence are unclear. This study examined one developmental process that potentially causes intelligence differences: learning to read. In 1,890 twin pairs tested at 7, 9, 10, 12, and 16 years, a cross-lagged monozygotic-differences design was used to test for associations of earlier within-pair reading ability differences with subsequent intelligence differences. The results showed several such associations, which were not explained by differences in reading exposure and were not restricted to verbal cognitive domains. The study highlights the potentially important influence of reading ability, driven by the nonshared environment, on intellectual development and raises theoretical questions about the mechanism of this influence.",

    "abstract": "In eutherian mammals and in humans, the female fetus may be masculinized while sharing the intra-uterine environment with a male fetus. Telomere length (TL), as expressed in leukocytes, is heritable and is longer in women than in men. The main determinant of leukocyte TL (LTL) is LTL at birth. However, LTL is modified by age-dependent attrition.\nWe studied LTL dynamics (LTL and its attrition) in adult same-sex (monozygotic, n\u2009=\u2009268; dizygotic, n\u2009=\u2009308) twins and opposite-sex (n\u2009=\u2009144) twins. LTL was measured by Southern blots of the terminal restriction fragments.\nWe observed that in same-sex (both monozygotic and dizygotic) twins, as reported in singletons, LTL was longer in females than in males [estimate\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error (SE):163\u2009\u00b1\u200963\u2009bp, P\u2009<\u20090.01]. However, in opposite-sex twins, female LTL was indistinguishable from that of males (-31\u2009\u00b1\u200952\u2009bp, P\u2009=\u20090.6), whereas male LTL was not affected. Findings were similar when the comparison was restricted to opposite-sex and same-sex dizygotic twins (females relative to males: same-sex: 188\u2009\u00b1\u200990\u2009bp, P\u2009<\u20090.05; other-sex: -32\u2009\u00b1\u200964\u2009bp, P\u2009=\u20090.6).\nThese findings are compatible with masculinization of the female fetus in opposite-sex twins. They suggest that the sex difference in LTL, seen in the general population, is largely determined in utero, perhaps by the intrauterine hormonal environment. Further studies in newborn twins are warranted to test this thesis.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent alcohol abuse is associated with adverse outcomes in early adulthood, but differences in familial status and structure and household and community environments correlate with both adolescent drinking and adverse adult outcomes and may explain their association. We studied drinking-discordant twin pairs to evaluate such confounds to ask: Will between-family associations replicate in within-family comparisons?\nWith longitudinal data from >3,000 Finnish twins, we associated drinking problems at age 18\u00bd with 13 outcomes assessed at age 25; included were sustained substance abuse, poor health, physical symptoms, early coital debut, multiple sexual partners, life dissatisfaction, truncated education, and financial problems. We assessed associations among twins as individuals with linear regression adjusted for correlated observations; within-family analyses of discordant twin pairs followed, comparing paired means for adult outcomes among co-twins discordant for adolescent problem drinking. Defining discordance by extreme scores on self-reported problem drinking at age 18\u00bd permitted parallel analyses of twins as individuals and discordant twin pairs. Alternate definitions of pair-wise discordance and difference score correlations across the entire twin sample yielded supplementary analyses.\nAll individual associations were highly significant for all definitions of discordance we employed. Depending on definitions of discordance, 11 to 13 comparisons of all drinking-discordant twin pairs and 3 to 6 comparisons of discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs replicated between-family associations. For most outcomes, effect size attenuated from individual-level analysis to that within discordant MZ twin pairs providing evidence of partial confounding in associations reported in earlier research. The exception was the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ); at age 25, GHQ-12 had equivalent associations with age 18\u00bd Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index across all comparisons.\nOur analyses control for shared family background, and, partly or fully, for shared genes, to yield within-family replications and more compelling evidence than previously available that adolescent alcohol abuse disrupts transitions into early adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from loss-of-function mutations in the UBR1 gene. JBS can be easily recognized by its unique clinical presentation (including exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, hypoplasia/aplasia of the alae nasi, congenital scalp defects, sensorineural hearing loss, growth retardation, psychomotor retardation, and anal and genitourinary anomalies). The objective of this study is to report on the first familial case of gender-discordant twins presenting JBS and a novel mutation in the UBR1 gene. We also review literature describing molecularly confirmed cases of JBS. The female twin developed refractory severe diarrhea after the second month of life and died at the age of 3 months. The male twin also developed diarrhea and failure to thrive after the 3 month of life but improved when nutrition support and pancreatic enzyme replacement was started, and he has survived into adolescence. Both patients presented typical clinical features of JBS. A homozygous nonsense mutation (c.3682C>T; p.Q1228X) in UBR1 was confirmed. Severe presentation of JBS usually involves deleterious (nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site) mutations in the UBR1 gene that are thought to completely abolish the expression of a functional protein product, as in this familial case; however, milder presentation of JBS has occasionally been observed with missense mutations in at least 1 of the 2 copies of UBR1, in which there may be residual activity of the product of this gene. Early diagnosis and adequate treatment are crucial for a favorable outcome.",

    "abstract": "The hypothesis that twinning raises risk for behavioral difficulties in childhood is persistent, yet there is limited and inconsistent empirical evidence. Simple mean comparison without control for confounders provides data on prevalence rates but cannot provide knowledge about risk or etiology. To assess the effect of twin relationship on behavior, comparison of patterns of association with single-born siblings may be informative. Analyses of data from an Australian sample of twins and single-born children (N = 305, mean age 4 years 9 months, and a follow-up 12 months later) were undertaken. The outcome measure was the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Predictor and control measures were obtained from parent report on the sibling/co-twin relationship behavior, family demographics, and obstetric history. We assessed difference between twins and single-born children in two respects: (a) mean behavioral difficulties, and (b) patterns of association between sibling relationship and behavioral difficulties, controlling for confounders. Results showed no differences in mean levels of behavioral difficulties between twins and single-born siblings identifying the importance of statistical control for family and obstetric adversity. Differences in patterns of association were found; for twin children, conflict in their co-twin relationship predicted externalizing behaviors, while for single-born children conflict predicted internalizing behaviors. The findings of mean differences between twin and single-born children in social background, but not in behavioral difficulties, underscore the necessity of statistical control to identify risk associated with twinning compared with risk associated with family and obstetric background factors.",

FSH following clomiphene citrate challenge test was 80 IU/L. Antral follicle count was 1. After failing two IVF cycles, natural cycle IVF with early hCG administration was attempted. Ovulation with 10,000 IU hCG was triggered when the dominant follicle was 10 mm in mean diameter. Two smaller follicles were also present. Oocyte collection was performed 38 h after hCG injection. Three mature oocytes were retrieved. Two oocytes fertilized normally. Two good-quality embryos were transferred on day 2. Bichorionic biamniotic pregnancy was achieved and healthy twins were delivered at term.\nThis case suggests that natural cycles with early hCG administration should be investigated further as an option for poor responders to retrieve more than one mature oocyte, and prevent premature ovulation. We believe this case to represent the patient with the highest serum FSH level, reflective of ovarian reserve at the time of treatment, to achieve a live birth. It is also the first case report to describe this modification on the traditional natural cycle.",

Three mature oocytes were retrieved. Two oocytes fertilized normally. Two good-quality embryos were transferred on day 2. Bichorionic biamniotic pregnancy was achieved and healthy twins were delivered at term.",

Results\u2003Cloaca is one of the most complex and severe degrees of anorectal malformations in girls. We present a discordant cloaca in monoamniotic twins. Fetal ultrasound showed a female fetus with a pelvic midline cystic mass, a phallus-like structure, a probable anorectal atresia with absence of anal dimple and a flat perineum, and renal anomalies. The diagnosis was confirmed by fetal magnetic resonance imaging postnatally. Conclusions\u2003The rarity of the malformation in a monoamniotic pregnancy, the difficulties of prenatal diagnosis, the pathogenic assumptions, and the consequences of adequate amniotic fluid for fetal lung development are discussed.",

    "abstract": "68Ga-labelled compounds are increasingly used for somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy because of their favourable biokinetic properties, a higher tumour-to-background contrast and higher diagnostic accuracy compared to the gamma-emitting tracer 111In-DTPA-octreotide. Recently, we have introduced the new tracer 68Ga-DOTA-3-iodo-Tyr3-Thr8-octreotide (68Ga-HA-DOTATATE). The present study demonstrates the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of this tracer in humans.\nSeven men were enrolled in this analysis. Every patient underwent a 20 min dynamic PET scan after intravenous injection of about 114\u2009\u00b1\u20099 MBq of 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE. This was followed by two whole-body scans at 30 min p.\u2009i. and 120 min p.\u2009i. Blood radioactivity concentration was determined non-invasively from a ROI drawn over the aorta. Urine was collected until the time of the last scan. Liver, spleen, kidneys and urinary bladder wall were included in the dosimetric estimation that was carried out with the software package OLINDA 1.0.\nPhysiological 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE uptake was observed in the pituitary gland, thyroid, salivary glands, liver, spleen, kidneys, urinary bladder, adrenals and intestine. Organs with the highest absorbed dose were spleen (0.26\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11 mSv/MBq), kidneys (0.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 mSv/MBq) and liver (0.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 mSv/MBq).The estimated effective dose was 0.024\u2009\u00b1\u20090.001 mSv/MBq.\nOur study demonstrates biokinetics and radiation exposure of the 68Ga-labelled tracer HA-DOTATATE to be comparable to other 68Ga-labelled SSR analogues in clinical use.",

    "abstract": "As the literature on long-term effects of childbirth on risk of morbidity or permanent work incapacity (DP) is limited, we aimed to study associations of childbirth with hospitalization and DP, adjusting for familial factors.\nThis cohort study included female twins, i.e. women with twin sister, born 1959-1990 in Sweden (n\u200a=\u200a5 118). At least one in the twin pair had their first childbirth 1994-2009. Women were followed regarding all-cause and cause-specific (mental or musculoskeletal diagnoses) DP during year 2-5 after first delivery or equivalent. Associations between childbirth, hospitalization and DP were calculated as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nWomen who did not give birth had markedly higher number of DP days/year compared to those giving birth. Hospitalization after first childbirth was associated with a higher HR of DP. Those hospitalized at least once after their first childbirth had a three-fold DP risk (HR: 3.2; 95% CI 1.1-9.6), DP due to mental diagnoses (HR: 3.2; 1.2-8.8), and of DP due to musculoskeletal diagnoses (HR: 6.1; 1.6-22.9). Lower HRs in the discordant twin pair analyses indicated that familial factors may influence the studied associations.\nWomen who did not give birth had a much higher risk for DP than those who did. Among those who gave birth, the risk for DP was markedly higher among those with a previous hospitalization, and especially in women with repeated hospitalizations. The results indicate a health selection into giving birth as well as the importance of morbidity for DP.",

    "abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease caused by genetic and environmental factors. More than 160 susceptibility loci have been identified for IBD, yet a large part of the genetic variance remains unexplained. Recent studies have demonstrated genetic differences between monozygotic twins, who were long thought to be genetically completely identical.\nWe aimed to test if somatic mutations play a role in CD etiology by sequencing the genomes and exomes of directly affected tissue from the bowel and blood samples of one and the blood-derived exomes of two further monozygotic discordant twin pairs. Our goal was the identification of mutations present only in the affected twins, pointing to novel candidates for CD susceptibility loci. We present a thorough genetic characterization of the sequenced individuals but detected no consistent differences within the twin pairs. An estimate of the CD susceptibility based on known CD loci however hinted at a higher mutational load in all three twin pairs compared to 1,920 healthy individuals.\nSomatic mosaicism does not seem to play a role in the discordance of monozygotic CD twins. Our study constitutes the first to perform whole genome sequencing for CD twins and therefore provides a valuable reference dataset for future studies. We present an example framework for mosaicism detection and point to the challenges in these types of analyses.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effect of genetic and environmental influences on cerebral motor function, we determined similarities and differences of movement-related cortical fields (MRCFs) in middle-aged and elderly monozygotic (MZ) twins. MRCFs were measured using a 160-channel magnetoencephalogram system when MZ twins were instructed to repeat lifting of the right index finger. We compared latency, amplitude, dipole location, and dipole intensity of movement-evoked field 1 (MEF1) between 16 MZ twins and 16 pairs of genetically unrelated pairs. Differences in latency and dipole location between MZ twins were significantly less than those between unrelated age-matched pairs. However, amplitude and dipole intensity were not significantly different. These results suggest that the latency and dipole location of MEF1 are determined early in life by genetic and early common environmental factors, whereas amplitude and dipole intensity are influenced by long-term environmental factors. Improved understanding of genetic and environmental factors that influence cerebral motor function may contribute to evaluation and improvement for individual motor function.",

A fortuitous meeting with parents of twins in the fishing town of Jaimanitas was also an extraordinary event. The Cuban experience is followed by summaries of recent twin research, covering umbilical cord entanglement, the heritability of clubfoot and school separation policies for twins. Media reports include twins reunited at age 78, the future of UCLA's twin basketball players, MZ twins born holding hands, a twin conflict over beer and a pair of American Psychological Association honors for Drs Nancy L.

    "abstract": "Ageing is a complex multifactorial process, reflecting the progression of all degenerative pathways within an organism. Due to the increase of life expectancy, in recent years, there is a pressing need to identify early-life events and risk factors that determine health outcomes in later life. So far, genetic variation only explains ~20-25\u00a0% of the variability of human survival to age 80+. This clearly implies that other factors (environmental, epigenetic and lifestyle) contribute to lifespan and the rate of healthy ageing within an individual. Twin studies in the past two decades proved to be a very powerful tool to discriminate the genetic from the environmental component. The aim of this review is to describe the basic concepts of the twin study design and to report some of the latest studies in which high-throughput technologies (e.g. genome/epigenome-wide assay, next generation sequencing, MS metabolic profiling) combined with the classical twin design have been applied to the analysis of novel 'omics' to further understand the molecular mechanisms of human ageing.",

    "abstract": "Dicephalus dipus dibrachius twins are a rare form of conjoined twins. An autopsy of conjoined dicephalus twins is reported. The diagnosis was performed during the pregnancy and the family received a judicial authorization for termination of pregnancy. The preterm newborn progressed to cardiac arrest and died following a court order to terminate the pregnancy. The conceptus presented two arms, two legs, a trunk, two heads, and a single umbilical cord. The two spinal columns presented vertebral fusion in the sacral region. The heart exhibited complex malformations. The external genitalia were female; and cytogenetic analysis confirmed female sex (46, XX). This analysis also corroborated the etiopathogenic hypotheses described for this abnormality, which proposes failures in embryonic formation rather than specific chromosomal alterations. Current identification of cases by ultrasound permits medical management and multidisciplinary action with the family, enabling the legal termination of pregnancy.",

The conjoined twins were diagnosed in 4(th) month of pregnancy by ultrasonography. The pregnancy terminates at 36 weeks by cesarean section and triplets were born. The babies were male conjoined twins and another healthy male baby. Many congenital defects of interest can now be detected before birth. Sever form of this malformation precludes postpartum life.

    "abstract": "Psychotic disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts, the etiology of which remains unknown across diagnoses. Thus it is relevant to understand how genetic and environmental factors contribute to the liability of suicide attempts in psychosis. The current study aims to examine the role of genetic and environmental factors in suicide attempts across psychotic disorders in twins concordant for psychosis. The study population consisted of all twin pairs in the Israeli National Psychiatric Case Registry hospitalized with a last discharge diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. Twin pairs (N=116) were born between 1900 and 1993 and hospitalized from 1964 to 2001. Competing genetic models were examined to decompose the variance in suicide attempts into: the individual-specific environment (unique), shared-family environment, and genetic effects. Across schizophrenia, psychosis and non-affective psychosis comparison of genetic models showed a model combining shared-family and unique environmental effects were superior to competing genetic models. Modeling estimates for attempted suicide were: in non-affective psychosis 60% to the shared-family and 40% to the unique environment; in schizophrenia 60% to the shared-family and 40% to the unique environment; and in psychosis 66% to the shared-family and 34% to the unique environment. Across psychosis, schizophrenia and non-affective psychosis vulnerability toward suicide attempts consists predominantly of substantial individual and familial environmental elements.",

    "abstract": "To examine trends for preterm births, stillbirths, neonatal and infant deaths in twin births by gestational age and birth weight categories, as well as trends in induction of labor and cesarean delivery during 1995-2006.\nA trend analysis was performed on data derived from the National Centers for Health Statistics' Vital Statistics Data files (1995-2006). The primary outcomes examined were preterm birth, stillbirth, neonatal and infant mortality.\nDuring the study period, rates of labor induction among twins decreased by 8% and rates of cesarean delivery increased by 35%. Concurrently, the preterm birth rate increased by 13% from 54% in 1995-96 to 61% in 2005-06. The overall stillbirth rate, and neonatal and infant death rates decreased during the same period by 21% (95% confidence interval (CI): 18-25%), 13% (95% CI: 9-16%) and 12% (95% CI: 8-15%), respectively. There were significant reductions in neonatal death rates related to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS; 48%, 95% CI: 41-54%) and congenital anomalies (25%, 95% CI: 16-33%) during the study period. Reductions in post-neonatal infant mortality were mainly in RDS (88%) and sudden infant death syndrome (26%). Mortality rates among infants born by either induction of labor or cesarean delivery fell during the study period and remained much lower than the overall infant mortality rate.\nThe findings of this study suggest that during 1995-2006 there was an increase in preterm birth rates and a decrease in labor inductions with a sharp decline in stillbirth, neonatal and infant mortality rates.",

The twins have a negative family history of hypodontia and oligodontia in their parents, as well as their paternal and maternal grandmothers and first cousins. No other dental anomalies could be detected in either of the twins. With the occurrence of similarly located tooth agenesis, except for one tooth, in monozygotic twins, one may consider the influence of genetic and/or environmental factors in their etiology. Hereditary relationships associated with oligodontia could help the clinicians to predict the possibility of its occurrence in other family members and in the next generations. However, clinicians should consider oligodontia when it is not hereditary.",

    "abstract": "Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have shown a positive association between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and problematic alcohol use in adults. To what extent this association is explained by genetic and environmental factors is largely unknown.\nData on ADHD and alcohol consumption were collected by self-report in 6024 adult Dutch twins. ADHD symptoms were assessed by three subscales of the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales\u00a0-\u00a0Self-Report: Screening Version (CAARS-S:SV): inattentiveness, hyperactivity and the ADHD index (ADHD-I). Problem drinking was defined as at least two self-reported alcohol-related problems on the CAGE questionnaire. Structural equation modelling was applied to the bivariate twin data to estimate genetic and environmental influences.\nHeritability of ADHD symptoms ranged between 32% and 40% and heritability of problem drinking was 50%. The positive correlation between ADHD symptoms and problem drinking was confirmed in this general population sample, with phenotypic correlations between 0.20 and 0.28 and genetic correlations between 0.39 and 0.50. Phenotypic correlations are primarily (61-100%) explained by genetic influences with non-shared environmental influences explaining the remaining covariance. No significant quantitative or qualitative gender differences in covariance structure were found.\nThis study convincingly shows that ADHD symptoms and problem drinking are moderately but significantly correlated in adults and that genetic correlations are primarily underlying this association. This suggests that early interventions are required to prevent adolescents with ADHD from developing problematic levels of alcohol use. Furthermore, clinicians who treat alcohol-dependent patients should be aware that the patient may have a co-morbid condition of ADHD; integrated interventions are required.",

    "abstract": "The biological age difference among twins is frequently an issue in studies of genetic influence on various dental features, particularly dental development. The timing of dental development is a crucial issue also for many clinicians and researchers. The aim of this study was therefore to verify within groups of twins how dental development differs, by applying Demirjian's method, Mincer's charts of development of third molars and two of Cameriere's methods for dental age estimation, which are among the most popular methods both in the clinical and the forensic scenario. The sample consisted of 64 twin pairs: 21 monozygotic, 30 dizygotic same-sex and 13 dizygotic opposite-sex with an age range between 5.8 and 22.6 years. Dental age was determined from radiographs using the mentioned methods. Results showed that dental age of monozygotic twins is not identical even if they share all their genes. The mean intra-pair difference of monozygotic pairs was low and similar to the difference in dizygotic same-sex twins; the maximum difference between monozygotic twins, however, was surprisingly large (nearly two years). This should lead to some circumspection in the interpretation of systematic estimations of dental age both in the clinical and forensic scenario.",

    "abstract": "Low weight at birth has previously been shown to be associated with a number of adult diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and obesity later in life. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been published for singleton-born individuals, but the role of genetic variation in birth weight (BW) in twins has not yet been fully investigated. A GWAS was performed in 4,593 female study participants with BW data available from the TwinsUK cohort. A genome-wide significant signal was found in chromosome 9, close to the NTRK2 gene (OMIM: 600456). QIMR, an Australian twin cohort (n = 3,003), and UK-based singleton-birth individuals from the Hertfordshire cohort (n = 2,997) were used as replication for the top two single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) underpinning this signal, rs12340987 and rs7849941. The top SNP, rs12340987, was found to be in the same direction in the Australian twins and in the singleton-born females (fixed effects meta-analysis beta = -0.13, SE = 0.02, and p = 1.48 \u00d7 10-8) but not in the singleton-born males tested. These findings provide an important insight into the genetic component of BW in twins who are normally excluded due to their lower BW when compared with singleton births, as well as the difference in BW between twins. The NTRK2 gene identified in this study has previously been associated with obesity.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart defects (CHD) occur in 40% of patients with trisomy 21, while the other 60% have a structurally normal heart. This suggests that the increased dosage of genes on chromosome 21 is a risk factor for abnormal heart development. Interaction of genes on chromosome 21 or their gene products with certain alleles of genes on other chromosomes could contribute to CHD. Here, we identified a pair of monozygotic twins with trisomy 21 but discordant for a ventricular septal defect and epilepsy. Twin-zygosity was confirmed by microsatellite genotyping. We hypothesized that some genetic differences from post-twinning mutations caused the discordant phenotypes. Thus, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies were applied to sequence both whole genome and exome of their leukocytes. The post-analyses of the sequencing data revealed 21 putative discordant exonic variants between the twins from either genome or exome data. However, of the 15 variants chosen for validation with conventional Sanger sequencing, these candidate variants showed no differences in both twins. The fact that no discordant DNA variants were found suggests that sequence differences of DNA from leukocytes of monozygotic twins might be extremely rare. It also emphasizes the limitation of the current NGS technology in identifying causative genes for discordant phenotypes in monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent depression is a common neuropsychiatric disorder that often continues into adulthood and is associated with a wide range of poor outcomes including suicide. Although numerous studies have looked at genetic markers associated with depression, the role of epigenetic variation remains relatively unexplored.\nMonozygotic (MZ) twins were selected from an adolescent twin study designed to investigate the interplay of genetic and environmental factors in the development of emotional and behavioral difficulties. There were 18 pairs of MZ twins identified in which one member scored consistently higher (group mean within the clinically significant range) on self-rated depression than the other. We assessed genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in twin buccal cell DNA using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip from Illumina. Quality control and data preprocessing was undertaken using the wateRmelon package. Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were identified using an analysis strategy taking into account both the significance and the magnitude of DNA methylation differences. The top differentially methylated DMP was successfully validated by bisulfite-pyrosequencing, and identified DMPs were tested in postmortem brain samples obtained from patients with major depressive disorder (n = 14) and matched control subjects (n = 15).\nTwo reproducible depression-associated DMPs were identified, including the top-ranked DMP that was located within STK32C, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase, of unknown function.\nOur data indicate that DNA methylation differences are apparent in MZ twins discordant for adolescent depression and that some of the disease-associated variation observed in buccal cell DNA is mirrored in adult brain tissue obtained from individuals with clinical depression.",

However, not so many studies have been based on it due to the difficulty in recruiting the participants. It also makes the only existing research on twins raised apart particularly valuable. How to utilize these resources fully will be the focus of this research area. This review will overview its design background, basic hypothesis, and current status of research and give advice for the research in this field in China.",

A total of 663 twin pairs completed the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised and scores were available for Performance, Verbal and Total Intelligence Quotient (IQ). The intrauterine factors examined were birth weight, placental weight and morphology, cord knots, cord length and cord insertion. IQ scores for the varying levels of the intrauterine markers adjusting for gender and gestational age were calculated. The heritability of IQ and the association between IQ and intrauterine environment were examined. Twins with lower birth weight and cord knots had lower IQ scores. The aetiology of IQ is largely distinct from that of birth weight and cord knots, and non-shared environment may influence the observed relationships.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies, especially those involving monozygotic (MZ) twins, facilitate the analysis of factors affecting skin aging while controlling for age, gender, and genetic susceptibility. The purpose of this study was to objectively assess various features of facial skin and analyze the effects of environmental factors on these features in MZ twins. At the Osaka Twin Research Center, 67 pairs of MZ twins underwent medical interviews and photographic assessments, using the VISIA(\u00ae) Complexion Analysis System. First, the average scores of the right and left cheek skin spots, wrinkles, pores, texture, and erythema were calculated; the differences between the scores were then compared in each pair of twins. Next, using the results of medical interviews and VISIA data, we investigated the effects of environmental factors on skin aging. The data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The intrapair differences in facial texture scores significantly increased as the age of the twins increased (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Among the twin pairs who provided answers to the questions regarding history differences in medical interviews, the twins who smoked or did not use skin protection showed significantly higher facial texture or wrinkle scores compared with the twins not exposed to cigarettes or protectants (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04 and 0.03, respectively). The study demonstrated that skin aging among Japanese MZ twins, especially in terms of facial texture, was significantly influenced by environmental factors. In addition, smoking and skin protectant use were important environmental factors influencing skin aging.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome is a genomic disorder caused by a recurrent 600 kb long deletion. The deletion affects the region of a common inversion present in about 20% of Europeans. The inversion is associated with the H2 haplotype carrying additional low-copy repeats susceptible to non-allelic homologous recombination, and this haplotype is prone to deletion. No instances of 17q21.31 deletions inherited from an affected parent have been reported, and the deletions always affected a parental chromosome with the H2 haplotype. The syndrome is characterized clinically by intellectual disability, hypotonia, friendly behavior and specific facial dysmorphism with long face, large tubular or pear-shaped nose and bulbous nasal tip. We present monozygotic twin sisters showing the typical clinical picture of the syndrome. The phenotype of the sisters was very similar, with a slightly more severe presentation in Twin B. The 17q21.31 microdeletion was confirmed in both patients but in neither of their parents. Potential copy number differences between the genomes of the twins were subsequently searched using high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and comparative genome hybridisation (CGH) arrays. However, these analyses identified no additional aberrations or genomic differences that could potentially be responsible for the subtle phenotypic differences. These could possibly be related to the more severe perinatal history of Twin B, or to the variable expressivity of the disorder. In accord with the expectations, one of the parents (the mother) was shown to carry the H2 haplotype, and the maternal allele of chromosome 17q21.31 was missing in the twins.",

    "abstract": "Neonates with blistering skin diseases are dermatologic emergencies. The pathologies involved can pose diagnostic difficulties and there exists a variety of potential life-threatening differential diagnoses.\ndescription of the first case of intrauterine acquired herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 infection in twins.\nWe present the case of two premature bicordial biamniotic twins (27th week of gestation) whose intrauterine growth retardation, fetal anaemia and cardiotocography abnormalities led to a caesarean emergency delivery.\nAccurate medical history revealed a maternal febrile gingivostomatitis at the 23rd week of gestation, which was neglected by the treating gynaecologist. Respiratory distress was present at delivery and intubation was necessary in both children. The whole skin showed extensive erosions and ulcerations and the mucosa of the eyes and genitals was also involved. Intrauterine Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 infection was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of skin Tzanck smear (HSV 1 positive, HSV 2 negative), real-time polymerase chain reaction of both serum and skin (HSV 1 positive; HSV 2 negative) and maternal serology positive for HSV 1 IgM and IgG. Siblings were immediately treated with high-dose endovenous acyclovir. Anaemia thrombocytopenia and hepatorenal values markedly deteriorated and both developed consequential hepatorenal failure. The third day live supportive measures were terminated after parental informed consent and both siblings deceased shortly after on their mother's breast.\nIntrauterine HSV infection is rare and accounts only for 5% of neonatal HSV infections. Literature reports only 64 cases and 90% of those are related to HSV-2. Transplacental viral transmission is highest during the first 20 weeks of gestation and has been observed in pregnant women with disseminated HSV infection. Mortality and morbidity of intrauterine herpetic infection are extremely high.\nDespite transplacental HSV transmission remains a rare event, the potential devastating outcome justifies immediate adequate antiviral treatment in a pregnant woman affected by primary HSV infection.",

    "results": "Accurate medical history revealed a maternal febrile gingivostomatitis at the 23rd week of gestation, which was neglected by the treating gynaecologist. Respiratory distress was present at delivery and intubation was necessary in both children. The whole skin showed extensive erosions and ulcerations and the mucosa of the eyes and genitals was also involved. Intrauterine Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 infection was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of skin Tzanck smear (HSV 1 positive, HSV 2 negative), real-time polymerase chain reaction of both serum and skin (HSV 1 positive; HSV 2 negative) and maternal serology positive for HSV 1 IgM and IgG. Siblings were immediately treated with high-dose endovenous acyclovir. Anaemia thrombocytopenia and hepatorenal values markedly deteriorated and both developed consequential hepatorenal failure. The third day live supportive measures were terminated after parental informed consent and both siblings deceased shortly after on their mother's breast.",

    "abstract": "Genetic effects that contribute to the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been reported. Our purpose was to estimate the possible genetic influence on CT features related to COPD in twins.\nTwo COPD-discordant and one COPD-concordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pair, in addition to 2 control dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs underwent a low-dose high resolution computer tomography (HRCT) in inspiration and expiration (Philips Brilliance 16).\nMonozygotic twins were more similar in lung volume expiration and in air trapping score compared to dizygotics (382 cm(3) vs. 2303 cm(3) and 17.6% vs. 26.6%, respectively). In general, MZ twin pairs showed almost identical HRCT features independently of smoking attitude and COPD status. The dizygotic twin pairs showed larger differences in HRCT features compared to MZ twins.\nLung parenchymal and small airway changes (lung density, presence of bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis and/or mucus plug formation, air trapping and emphysema score) seem to be genetically associated traits, independently of smoking/COPD history. A future study with a larger sample size should confirm our findings.",

    "abstract": "Identical twins have provided unique insights on timing or sequence of genetic events in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). To date, this has mainly focused on ALL with MLL or ETV6-RUNX1 fusions, with hyperdiploid ALL remaining less well characterised. We examined three pairs of monozygotic twins, two concordant and one discordant for hyperdiploid ALL, for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-defined copy number alterations (CNAs), IGH/L plus TCR gene rearrangements and mutations in NRAS, KRAS, FLT3 and PTPN11 genes. We performed whole exome sequencing in one concordant twin pair. Potential 'driver' CNAs were low, 0-3 per case, and all were different within a pair. One patient had an NRAS mutation that was lacking from leukaemic cells of the twin sibling. By exome sequencing, there were 12 nonsynonymous mutations found in one twin and 5 in the other, one of which in SCL44A2 was shared or identical. Concordant pairs had some identical IGH/L and TCR rearrangements. In the twin pair with discordant hyperdiploid ALL, the healthy co-twin had persistent low level hyperdiploid CD19+ cells that lacked a CNA present in the ALL cells of her sibling. From these data, we propose that hyperdiploid ALL arises in a pre-B cell in utero and mutational changes necessary for clinical ALL accumulate subclonally and postnatally.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the optimal gestational age at delivery for twins.\nRetrospective cohort study.\nDatabase containing demographic, delivery, and pregnancy outcome data for over 600,000 births from 81 hospitals in Alberta, Canada.\nAll twin births in Alberta, Canada, during 1992-2007, as recorded in the databases of the Alberta Perinatal Health Project (www.aphp.ca).\nThe case files were reviewed for cause of death and any information regarding the gestational age at diagnosis of stillbirth. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the impact of potentially confounding factors. The 'fetus at risk' approach was used to evaluate the prospective risk of stillbirth. Competing risks of stillbirth and neonatal death were evaluated with a perinatal risk ratio.\nOf a total of 17,724 twin births there were 236 antepartum stillbirths, 26 intrapartum stillbirths, and 244 neonatal deaths. The rate of stillbirth peaked at 7.0/1000 fetuses at risk at 38 weeks of gestation. On multivariate analysis, small for gestational age (odds ratio, OR 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 1.35-3.59), birthweight discrepancy >20% (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.42-5.03), and an interaction between these two variables (OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.31-6.59), were significant. The perinatal risk ratio suggested that the risks of delivery and expectant management were balanced at 36 weeks of gestation (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.1-5.4), but the confidence interval included one, the null value, until 38 weeks of gestation (RR 0.1, 95% CI 0.02-0.40). The majority of stillbirths at term (14/25) occurred in monochorionic diamniotic twins. The estimated risk of stillbirth in this group was 2.3/1000 fetuses at risk at 37 weeks of gestation, and 17.4/1000 fetuses at risk at 38 weeks of gestation.\nThe balance of risk between neonatal death/intrapartum stillbirth and antepartum stillbirth begins to favour delivery at 36 weeks of gestation, particularly in monochorionic diamniotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Open chromatin is implicated in regulatory processes; thus, variations in chromatin structure may contribute to variations in gene expression and other phenotypes. In this work, we perform targeted deep sequencing for open chromatin, and array-based genotyping across the genomes of 72 monozygotic twins to identify genetic factors regulating co-twin discordance in chromatin accessibility.\nWe show that somatic mutations cause chromatin discordance mainly via the disruption of transcription factor binding sites. Structural changes in DNA due to C:G to A:T transversions are under purifying selection due to a strong impact on chromatin accessibility. We show that CpGs whose methylation is specifically regulated during cellular differentiation appear to be protected from high mutation rates of 5'-methylcytosines, suggesting that the spectrum of CpG variations may be shaped fully at the developmental level but not through natural selection. Based on the association mapping of within-pair chromatin differences, we search for cases in which twin siblings with a particular genotype had chromatin discordance at the relevant locus. We identify 1,325 chromatin sites that are differentially accessible, depending on the genotype of a nearby locus, suggesting that epigenetic differences can control regulatory variations via interactions with genetic factors. Poised promoters present high levels of chromatin discordance in association with either somatic mutations or genetic-epigenetic interactions.\nOur observations illustrate how somatic mutations and genetic polymorphisms may contribute to regulatory, and ultimately phenotypic, discordance.",

    "results": "We show that somatic mutations cause chromatin discordance mainly via the disruption of transcription factor binding sites. Structural changes in DNA due to C:G to A:T transversions are under purifying selection due to a strong impact on chromatin accessibility. We show that CpGs whose methylation is specifically regulated during cellular differentiation appear to be protected from high mutation rates of 5'-methylcytosines, suggesting that the spectrum of CpG variations may be shaped fully at the developmental level but not through natural selection. Based on the association mapping of within-pair chromatin differences, we search for cases in which twin siblings with a particular genotype had chromatin discordance at the relevant locus. We identify 1,325 chromatin sites that are differentially accessible, depending on the genotype of a nearby locus, suggesting that epigenetic differences can control regulatory variations via interactions with genetic factors. Poised promoters present high levels of chromatin discordance in association with either somatic mutations or genetic-epigenetic interactions.",

    "abstract": "Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a well-known disorder of the hip in adolescents that is characterized by displacement of the capital femoral epiphysis from the metaphysis through the physis. Multiple theories have been proposed for the aetiology of idiopathic SCFE, and it is likely a result of both biomechanical and biochemical factors. The association between human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and certain rheumatic diseases is well established. One of the strongest associations is between the HLA class I antigen B27 and ankylosing spondylitis. Several DRB 1 alleles are associated with susceptibility to and severity of rheumatoid arthritis. The quest to find similar markers have fuelled the suggestion that SCFE may be linked to the presence of a specific HLA antigen. We present a case report of an identical twin presenting with SCFE. An 11-year-old girl presented with pain in her hip for last few days and difficulty in mobilizing. Radiographs showed SCFE that was fixed in situ with one screw. Eighteen months later her twin sister presented with pain in hip and limp of 3-week duration with no preceding history of trauma. Radiographs showed SCFE that was fixed in situ with one screw. Both sisters have made full recovery with no pain or residual limp. HLA typing of the twins showed variations between diseases and HLA phenotype in different population groups with SCFE. This is the fifth case of identical twins presenting with SCFE with HLA class I analysis and only the second case report with both HLA class I and class II analysis. Our case report further emphasizes findings from previous studies that there is no relationship between SCFE and a specific HLA class I or class II antigen.\nLevel V.",

    "abstract": "Poland Syndrome (PS) is a rare disorder characterized by hypoplasia/aplasia of the pectoralis major muscle, variably associated with thoracic and upper limb anomalies. Familial recurrence has been reported indicating that PS could have a genetic basis, though the genetic mechanisms underlying PS development are still unknown.\nHere we describe a couple of monozygotic (MZ) twin girls, both presenting with Poland Syndrome. They carry a de novo heterozygous 126 Kbp deletion at chromosome 11q12.3 involving 5 genes, four of which, namely HRASLS5, RARRES3, HRASLS2, and PLA2G16, encode proteins that regulate cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, mainly through Ras-mediated signaling pathways.\nPhenotype concordance between the monozygotic twin probands provides evidence supporting the genetic control of PS. As genes controlling cell growth and differentiation may be related to morphological defects originating during development, we postulate that the observed chromosome deletion could be causative of the phenotype observed in the twin girls and the deleted genes could play a role in PS development.",

    "abstract": "The influences of formal child care before age 4 on behavioral problems at 3, 5, and 7 years of age were assessed in 18,932 Dutch twins (3,878 attended formal child care). The effect of formal child care was studied on the average level of problem behavior and as moderator of genetic and non-genetic influences, while taking into account effects of sex and parental socio-economic status (SES). There was a small association between attending formal child care and higher externalizing problems, especially when SES was low. Heritability was lower for formal child care and in lower SES conditions. These effects were largest at age 7 and for externalizing problems. In 7 year-old boys and girls, the difference in heritability between the formal child care group of low SES and the home care group of high SES was 30% for externalizing and ~20% for internalizing problems. The decrease in heritability was explained by a larger influence of the environment, rather than by a decrease in genetic variance. These results support a bioecological model in which heritability is lower in circumstances associated with more problem behavior.",

Here we report the presence and formation mechanism of deformation {111} twins in the rock-salt manganese sulphide (MnS) inclusions embedded in a hot-rolled stainless steel. Based on the atomic-scale mapping under aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, a dislocation-based mechanism involved two synchronized shear on adjacent atomic layers is proposed to describe the dislocation glide and consequently twinning formation. First-principles calculations of the energy barriers for twinning formation in MnS and comparing with that of PbS and MgO indicate the distinct dislocation glide scheme and deformation behaviors for the rock-salt compounds with different ionicities. This study may improve our understanding of the deformation mechanisms of rock-salt crystals and other ionic compounds.",

Maintenance in an intensive care setting during this time allows for close monitoring, stabilisation, and nutritional supplementation of the infants as necessary to optimise preoperative growth and development. The birth of conjoined twins is a very difficult and dramatic moment for parents. It is also a very difficult situation for the team of physicians, nurses and other required hospital staff to carry out treatment and care of these specific developmental anomalies. The diagnostics and treatment in this extraordinary situation requires close cooperation of the multidisciplinary medical team, which includes their personal experience and medical knowledge, with a team of intensive care unit nurses.

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins have been a source of fascination to the public and the medical profession for centuries. Their birth was initially viewed as an ominous sign of impending disaster. Since Middle Ages into the 19th century they were regarded as monstrosities and were exhibited at circuses and sideshows. The frequency of conjoined twins is approximately 1 in 50,000 gestation, but many of them die in utero, are terminated or stillborn. The true incidence is estimated to be 1 in 200,000 live births. This article gives an overview of Siamese twins and of the prenatal diagnosis in assessing the prognosis, anaesthetic and post-natal surgical management and outcome. Anaesthesia for conjoined twins surgery, whether prior to or for separation, is an enormous challenge to the anaesthesiologist. The site and complexity of the conjunction affect management of the airway, an intravenous access, the extent of blood and number of surgical specialties involved. Preoperative assessment and planning with interdisciplinary communication and cooperation is vital to the success of the operations. Meticulous attention to detail, monitoring and vigilance are mandatory.",

    "abstract": "Twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS) is a recently described complication of monochorionic placentation characterized by discordance in hemoglobin (Hgb) levels in the absence of amniotic fluid abnormality characteristic of classical twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). The placental angioarchitecture that predisposes to TAPS consists of small diameter arteriovenous anastomoses and the absence of balancing arterioarterial anastomoses. This vascular pattern occurs sporadically in 3 to 5% of monochorionic twins or iatrogenically following 2 to 13% of selective fetoscopic laser surgeries for TTTS. The diagnosis is based on measurement of the middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) which is not part of the Quintero staging for TTTS. With mild disease increased MCA-PSV in the anemic donor twin and a decreased MCA-PSV in the recipient twin are characteristic while severe disease is associated with critical Doppler findings, hydrops or single twin demise as in TTTS. Treatment options include fetoscopic laser, fetal blood transfusion, conservative management, and often preterm delivery. The most promising approach to TAPS is its prevention since the iatrogenic form comprises the majority of cases. When the fetoscopic laser technique is modified by coagulating the chorionic plate along the vascular equator (equatorial dichorionization or \"Solomon\" technique) the incidence of postlaser TAPS and recurrent TTTS is significantly reduced, survival is improved, and there is no increase in complications.",

The questions focused on the issues of 2010\u00a0and 2011. Two reminders were sent in case of no answer.\nThe response rate to the questionnaire was 56\u00a0%; 81\u00a0% of centers have experienced at least once during the two years 2010-2011\u00a0a discordant fetal anomaly in monochorionic twin pregnancy. Only 59\u00a0% of centers perform all the techniques of STOP. When interruption of the umbilical blood flow is considered, bipolar forceps coagulation is the most used (75\u00a0%). Achieving STOP during a cesarean section is a common practice (75\u00a0% of centers). Locoregional anesthesia is the preferred mode of anesthesia for STOP.\nSTOP on monochorionic twin pregnancy is not practiced in all Multidisciplinary Center for Prenatal Diagnosis in France. The most widely practiced and most studied technique is bipolar forceps coagulation. The option of an expectant management should always be considered and its risks should be balanced with those of STOP. The practice of STOP during cesarean section is not unusual.",

Moreover, the extent to which structural brain network topology overlaps with heritability for integrity and volume of white matter remains unknown. In this study, structural network topology was examined using diffusion tensor imaging at 3T. Binary connections between 82 structurally defined brain regions per subject were traced, allowing for estimation of individual topological network properties. Heritability of normalized characteristic path length (\u03bb), normalized clustering coefficient (\u03b3), microstructural integrity (FA), and volume of the white matter were estimated using a twin design, including 156 adult twins from the newly acquired U-TWIN cohort. Both \u03b3 and \u03bb were estimated to be under substantial genetic influence. The heritability of \u03b3 was estimated to be 68%, the heritability estimate for \u03bb was estimated to be 57%. Genetic influences on network measures were found to be partly overlapping with volumetric and microstructural properties of white matter, but the largest component of genetic variance was unique to both network traits. Normalized clustering coefficient and normalized characteristic path length are substantially heritable, and influenced by independent genetic factors that are largely unique to network measures, but partly also implicated in white matter directionality and volume. Thus, network measures provide information about genetic influence on brain structure, independent of global white matter characteristics such as volume and microstructural directionality.",

Skin lesions typical for LoS occurred in both patients, at the age of 10. One sister was diagnosed with linear LoS of the lower limb affecting deeper situated subcutaneous tissue and muscles. The other sister was diagnosed with guttate LoS of the trunk, with slow progression of the skin lesions. In both sisters vulvar LiS developed at the age of\u00a019.\nCo-existence of LiS and LoS in monozygotic twins indicates the possible genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of these diseases and the close relationship between them.",

    "abstract": "Although the phenotypic correlation between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is well known, the genetic basis for the correlation has rarely been investigated. The aim of this paper is to examine the genetic overlap between SBP and DBP by fitting bivariate models to Danish and Chinese twins and comparing ethnic differences between the two samples. Our estimates revealed a high proportion of additive genetic components shared by both SBP and DBP in Danish (0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65-0.75) and Chinese (0.62, 95% CI: 0.50-0.71) twins with no statistically significant ethnic differences. The estimated genetic component in phenotypic correlation could serve to guide molecular genetic studies searching for genetic variants that affect both SBP and DBP. The bivariate model also estimated genetic and environmental contributions to SBP and DBP separately, with an overall pattern of higher genetic regulation or heritability in Danish (0.72, 95% CI: 0.67-0.76 for SBP; 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.75 for DBP) than in Chinese (0.54, 95% CI: 0.44-0.63 for SBP; 0.57, 95% CI: 0.47-0.65 for DBP) twins and a higher contribution from unique environmental factors in Chinese compared with Danish twins. The estimated contribution from unique environmental factors suggests that promoting healthy lifestyles may provide an efficient way of controlling high blood pressure, particularly in the Chinese population.",

    "abstract": "Os odontoideum is a well identified anomaly of the craniovertebral junction. Since its initial description, there has been a continuous debate regarding the nature of its etiology: Whether congenital or traumatic. We sought to compare the gene expression profiles in patients with congenital os odontoideum, those with traumatic os odontoideum and controls.\nWe have evaluated a pair of identical twins both with os odontoideum. We identified two additional patients with and four subjects without os odontoideum. We analyzed the gene expression profiles in these patients using a custom TaqMan microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The relative gene expression profiles in the two identical twins, the two nontwin patients with os odontoideum and the controls were assessed.\nA total of 213 genes with significantly different expression between the twin os odontoideum patients and the subjects without os odontoideum were detected. CACNG6, PHEX, CACNAD3, IL2, FAS, TUFT1, KIT, TGFBR2, and IGF2 were expressed at levels greater than 100-fold more in the twins. There were six genes with significantly different expression profiles in the twins as compared with the nontwin os odontoideum patients: CMK4, ATF1, PLCG1, TAB1, E2F3, and ATF4. There were no statistically significant differences in gene expression in the four patients with os odontoideum and the subjects without. Trends, however, were noted in MMP8, KIT, HIF1A, CREB3, PWHAZ, TGFBR1, NFKB2, FGFR1, IPO8, STAT1, COL1A1, and BMP3.\nOs odontoideum has multiple etiologies, both traumatic and congenital and perhaps some represent a combination of the two. This work has identified a number of genes that show increased expression in a pair of twins with congenital os odontoideum and also demonstrates trends in gene expression profiles between a larger group of os odontoideum patients and non-os patients. A number of these genes are related to bone morphogenesis and maintenance.",

    "abstract": "In the earth's crust and in seawater, K(+) and Na(+) are by far the most available monovalent inorganic cations. Physico-chemically, K(+) and Na(+) are very similar, but K(+) is widely used by plants whereas Na(+) can easily reach toxic levels. Indeed, salinity is one of the major and growing threats to agricultural production. In this article, we outline the fundamental bases for the differences between Na(+) and K(+). We present the foundation of transporter selectivity and summarize findings on transporters of the HKT type, which are reported to transport Na(+) and/or Na(+) and K(+), and may play a central role in Na(+) utilization and detoxification in plants. Based on the structural differences in the hydration shells of K(+) and Na(+), and by comparison with sodium channels, we present an ad hoc mechanistic model that can account for ion permeation through HKTs.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is one of the most extensively studied epigenetic marks in humans. Yet, it is largely unknown what causes variation in DNA methylation between individuals. The comparison of DNA methylation profiles of monozygotic (MZ) twins offers a unique experimental design to examine the extent to which such variation is related to individual-specific environmental influences and stochastic events or to familial factors (DNA sequence and shared environment). We measured genome-wide DNA methylation in buccal samples from ten MZ pairs (age 8-19) using the Illumina 450k array and examined twin correlations for methylation level at 420,921 CpGs after QC. After selecting CpGs showing the most variation in the methylation level between subjects, the mean genome-wide correlation (rho) was 0.54. The correlation was higher, on average, for CpGs within CpG islands (CGIs), compared to CGI shores, shelves and non-CGI regions, particularly at hypomethylated CpGs. This finding suggests that individual-specific environmental and stochastic influences account for more variation in DNA methylation in CpG-poor regions. Our findings also indicate that it is worthwhile to examine heritable and shared environmental influences on buccal DNA methylation in larger studies that also include dizygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Until now, no study has examined the genetic and environmental influences on psychopathic personality across different raters and method of assessment. Participants were part of a community sample of male and female twins born between 1990 and 1995. The Child Psychopathy Scale and the Antisocial Process Screening Device were administered to the twins and their parents when the twins were 14-15 years old. The Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV) was administered and scored by trained testers. Results showed that a 1-factor common pathway model was the best fit for the data. Genetic influences explained 69% of the variance in the latent psychopathic personality factor, while nonshared environmental influences explained 31%. Measurement-specific genetic effects accounted for between 9% and 35% of the total variance in each of the measures, except for PCL:YV, where all genetic influences were in common with the other measures. Measure-specific nonshared environmental influences were found for all measures, explaining between 17% and 56% of the variance. These findings provide further evidence of the heritability in psychopathic personality among adolescents, although these effects vary across the ways in which these traits are measured, in terms of both informant and instrument used.",

    "abstract": "To identify the incidence, risk factors, and obstetric/perinatal outcomes associated with monozygotic twins (MZTs) after IVF.\nNested case-control.\nUniversity-based center.\nThe IVF cycles eventuating in pregnancy from 2000-2009.\nNone.\nThe MZT incidence, chorionicity/zygosity, pregnancy/neonatal outcome.\nOf 6,223 gestations, 131 MZTs were diagnosed (2.1% incidence; 2.0% in autologous and 2.7% in donor IVF cycles), 10 were dichorionic, and 121 were monochorionic. Controlling for all risk factors, young oocyte age, extended culture (noncleavage embryos transferred on/after day 4), and year of IVF treatment cycle were significantly associated with MZT. When assessing factors associated with specific MZT placentation, day 3 assisted hatching correlated more with dichorionic MZT, whereas extended culture and advanced day 5 embryonic stage correlated with monochorionic MZT. Comparing monozygotic to dizygotic multigestation outcomes, MZT fared worse; however, once controlling for triplet gestation, only gestational age at delivery remained significantly compromised in the monozygotic group.\nAfter IVF the incidence of MZT is high, with young oocyte age, year of treatment, and extended culture (or embryo stage at transfer) conferring greatest risk. Regarding MZT type, assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures may influence the timing of embryonic splitting (i.e., division in early embryonic development may be influenced by zona pellucida [ZP] manipulation whereas later splitting may occur during delayed implantation). Poor obstetric/perinatal outcome is significantly impacted by the presence of an \"extra\" fetus, as high-order multiple gestation concurrent with an MZT conveyed the worst prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Craniofacial duplication or diprosopus is a very rare malformation that is present in approximately 0.4% of conjoined twins. Here is presented a case of craniofacial duplication in association with bilateral cleft lip/palate in both heads found in a ceramic representation from the early Chim\u00fa culture from Peru. A comparative analysis is made with a current case of a 28-week-old fetus with similar characteristics. After reviewing the medical literature on conjoined twins, very few reports of facial cleft in both twins were found, with no reports at all of bilateral cleft lip/palate. This ceramic crock is considered one of the first representations suggestive of craniofacial duplication, and probably the first reporting it in association with facial cleft.",

    "abstract": "Studies involving the analysis of structural variation including Copy Number Variation (CNV) have recently exploded in the literature. Furthermore, CNVs have been associated with a number of complex diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders. Common methods for CNV detection use SNP, CNV, or CGH arrays, where the signal intensities of consecutive probes are used to define the number of copies associated with a given genomic region. These practices pose a number of challenges that interfere with the ability of available methods to accurately call CNVs. It has, therefore, become necessary to develop experimental protocols to test the reliability of CNV calling methods from microarray data so that researchers can properly discriminate biologically relevant data from noise.\nWe have developed a workflow for the integration of data from multiple CNV calling algorithms using the same array results. It uses four CNV calling programs: PennCNV (PC), Affymetrix\u00ae Genotyping Console\u2122 (AGC), Partek\u00ae Genomics Suite\u2122 (PGS) and Golden Helix SVS\u2122 (GH) to analyze CEL files from the Affymetrix\u00ae Human SNP 6.0 Array\u2122. To assess the relative suitability of each program, we used individuals of known genetic relationships. We found significant differences in CNV calls obtained by different CNV calling programs.\nAlthough the programs showed variable patterns of CNVs in the same individuals, their distribution in individuals of different degrees of genetic relatedness has allowed us to offer two suggestions. The first involves the use of multiple algorithms for the detection of the largest possible number of CNVs, and the second suggests the use of PennCNV over all other methods when the use of only one software program is desirable.",

    "abstract": "Parental psychopathology, parenting style, and the quality of intrafamilial relationships are all associated with child mental health outcomes. However, most research can say little about the causal pathways underlying these associations. This is because most studies are not genetically informative and are therefore not able to account for the possibility that associations are confounded by gene-environment correlation. That is, biological parents not only provide a rearing environment for their child, but also contribute 50% of their genes. Any associations between parental phenotype and child phenotype are therefore potentially confounded. One technique for disentangling genetic from environmental effects is the children-of-twins (COT) method. This involves using data sets comprising twin parents and their children to distinguish genetic from environmental associations between parent and child phenotypes. The COT technique has grown in popularity in the last decade, and we predict that this surge in popularity will continue. In the present article we explain the COT method for those unfamiliar with its use. We present the logic underlying this approach, discuss strengths and weaknesses, and highlight important methodological considerations for researchers interested in the COT method. We also cover variations on basic COT approaches, including the extended-COT method, capable of distinguishing forms of gene-environment correlation. We then present a systematic review of all the behavioral COT studies published to date. These studies cover such diverse phenotypes as psychosis, substance abuse, internalizing, externalizing, parenting, and marital difficulties. In reviewing this literature, we highlight past applications, identify emergent patterns, and suggest avenues for future research.",

We investigate CD4(+) T-cell cytokine profiles and subpopulations in 19-year-old monozygotic twins with autism and different comorbidities. CD4(+) T cells from the twin with epilepsy produce more interferon-gamma, less interleukin-17, and have an increased interferon-\u03b3/interleukin-4 ratio. CD4(+) T cells from the twin with multiple sclerosis exhibit a cytokine profile similar to an age and gender-matched control and a higher percentage of T regulatory (Treg) cells. The twins' mother's T cells produce very high levels of both interleukin-17 and interferon-\u03b3. Cytokine and CD4(+) T-cell abnormalities in the twins could contribute to or be a result of the manifestation of their divergent comorbidities. A proinflammatory, autoimmune-polarized cytokine profile is observed in this unique family with autism.",

    "abstract": "Compared with other countries, the elective caesarean section rate for twins is relatively low in the Netherlands. Worldwide, there is an increasing trend toward performing more elective caesarean sections for women with a twin pregnancy at term, be it for twins with the first child in breech or in cephalic presentation. The results of the 'Twin Birth Study' indicate that a planned caesarean section does not improve outcome as compared with planned vaginal birth for twins with the first child in cephalic position beyond 32 weeks gestation. During the study, an experienced obstetrician was present during planned vaginal delivery and there was a possibility of performing a secondary caesarean section within 30 minutes. This study provides an additional argument to guarantee the aforementioned conditions in all hospitals where women plan to deliver their twins vaginally. However, the definition of an experienced obstetrician is subject to debate.",

    "abstract": "Length and weight in infancy are associated with neurodevelopment, but less is known about growth in other anthropometric measures. In this study we analyzed how the development in length, weight, head circumference, and chest circumference over infancy is associated with motor development in early childhood, using a twin study design. Information on physical development over infancy and the age at achievement of eight developmental milestones over early childhood was collected for 370 Japanese twin pairs. Linear mixed models were used to analyze how physical development is associated with motor development between individual twins, as well as within twin pairs, adjusting the results for shared maternal and postnatal environmental factors. Delayed motor development was associated with smaller body size over infancy, and we also found some suggestive evidence that it was associated with catch-up growth as well. When studying the associations within twin pairs discordant for motor development, similar associations were found. However, chest circumference showed the most robust association within discordant twin pairs. Smaller body size and rapid catch-up growth are associated with delayed motor development. When studying these associations within twin pairs and thus adjusting the results for gestational age as well as many other maternal and postnatal environmental factors, chest circumference showed the most robust association. Chest circumference, rarely used in developed countries, can offer additional information on prenatal conditions relevant for further motor development not achieved by more traditional anthropometric measures.",

    "abstract": "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an uncommon autoimmune disease with a homogeneous clinical phenotype that reflects incomplete disease concordance in monozygotic (MZ) twins. We have taken advantage of a unique collection consisting of genomic DNA and mRNA from peripheral blood cells of female MZ twins (n\u2009=\u20093 sets) and sisters of similar age (n\u2009=\u20098 pairs) discordant for disease. We performed a genome-wide study to investigate differences in (i) DNA methylation (using a custom tiled four-plex array containing tiled 50-mers 19,084 randomly chosen methylation sites), (ii) copy number variation (CNV) (with a chip including markers derived from the 1000 Genomes Project, all three HapMap phases, and recently published studies), and/or (iii) gene expression (by whole-genome expression arrays). Based on the results obtained from these three approaches we utilized quantitative PCR to compare the expression of candidate genes. Importantly, our data support consistent differences in discordant twins and siblings for the (i) methylation profiles of 60 gene regions, (ii) CNV of 10 genes, and (iii) the expression of 2 interferon-dependent genes. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that 17 of these genes are differentially expressed in discordant sibling pairs. In conclusion, we report that MZ twins and sisters discordant for PBC manifest particular epigenetic differences and highlight the value of the epigenetic study of twins.",

Over 120\u2009years after the condition has become a clinical entity the debate whether the cause of IHPS is genetic, environmental or both, has not yet reached a final conclusion.

We aimed to support genetic pre-disposition in the epidemiology of IHPS, adding a twin data to the literature and to review the associated articles about the pathogenesis and inheritance patterns.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive immunity in humans is provided by hypervariable Ig-like molecules on the surface of B and T cells. The final set of these molecules in each organism is formed under the influence of two forces: individual genetic traits and the environment, which includes the diverse spectra of alien and self-antigens. Here we assess the impact of individual genetic factors on the formation of the adaptive immunity by analyzing the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of three pairs of monozygous twins by next-generation sequencing. Surprisingly, we found that an overlap between the TCR repertoires of monozygous twins is similar to an overlap between the TCR repertoires of nonrelated individuals. However, the number of identical complementary determining region 3 sequences in two individuals is significantly increased for twin pairs in the fraction of highly abundant TCR molecules, which is enriched by the antigen-experienced T cells. We found that the initial recruitment of particular TCR V genes for recombination and subsequent selection in the thymus is strictly determined by individual genetic factors. J genes of TCRs are selected randomly for recombination; however, the subsequent selection in the thymus gives preference to some \u03b1 but not \u03b2 J segments. These findings provide a deeper insight into the mechanism of TCR repertoire generation.",

    "abstract": "Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in industrialized countries. Whereas the use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has led to a significant decline in early-onset sepsis, the incidence of late-onset sepsis has remained unchanged. Whether late-onset sepsis usually originates from established mucocutaneous GBS colonization of the infant or whether it results from an acute exogenous GBS infection remains controversial. Here we report on twins who both twice developed GBS sepsis in a strikingly parallel fashion, with both instances originating from a single hypervirulent GBS clone. Factored together, the presentation as cervical soft tissue infection in both cases, the synchronicity of the episodes, and the detection of GBS DNA in breast milk all strongly suggest an enteral mode of transmission with a short incubation period.",

    "abstract": "This study sets out to investigate the impact of work-home interference on burnout in women and men, while taking genetic and family environmental factors into account.\nA total of 4446 Swedish twins were included in the study. The effects of work-home conflict (WHC) and home-work conflict (HWC) on burnout between and within pairs were analyzed with co-twin control analyses.\nBoth WHC and HWC were significantly associated with burnout. Genetic factors may be involved in the association between HWC and burnout in women. Familial factors were not involved for WHC and burnout, neither for women nor for men.\nThis study shows the importance to encounter WHC per se to prevent burnout. Because of genetic confounding in HWC and burnout in women, preventive efforts may also take into account individual characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic (MC) pregnancy in humans is usually considered to be associated only with monozygotic twinning. However, several reports have revealed that dizygotic (DZ) twins can also share a chorion during pregnancy. A chimera is defined as an organism that contains different cells derived from two or more distinct zygotes. As artificial reproductive techniques develop, it can be predicted that the occurrence of MC DZ twins will increase, and DNA-fingerprinting methods, such as short tandem repeat (STR) analysis, will be essential for their accurate diagnosis. We report the first Korean case of MC DZ twins with blood chimerism, 46,XX/46,XY, as a consequence of in vitro fertilization/embryo transfer. The clinical phenotypes of the twins' genitalia were complete female and male, respectively. Monochorionicity was confirmed by pathological analysis of the placenta after delivery. The dizygosity and confined blood chimerism of the twins were confirmed by STR analysis using their peripheral lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts. The confined blood chimerism of the twins can be considered similar to the status of the hematopoietic system in patients after allogenic bone marrow transplantation.\nWhen MC twins with discordant sex are expected during pregnancy, it is important to consider the possibility of DZ twins showing normal sexual development, especially in twins who were fertilized using artificial reproductive techniques.",

We report the pathological findings in twin newborns who died during an acute infection. The twins were born 1 month premature but were well and neurologically intact at birth. After a week they developed acute lethal neonatal sepsis and seizures. Histopathology demonstrated meningoencephalitis and severe myocarditis, as well as pancreatitis, adrenal medullitis and nephritis. Abundant CB4 sequences were identified in nucleic acid extracted from the brain and heart. In situ hybridization with probes to CB4 demonstrated infection of neurons, myocardiocytes, endocrine pancreas and adrenal medulla. The distribution of infected cells and immune response is consistent with reported clinical symptomatology where systemic and neurological diseases are the result of CB4 infection of select target cells.",

    "abstract": "The first two years of life for children with Rett syndrome (RTT) have previously been viewed as relatively asymptomatic. However, it is possible that subtle symptoms may be present in early development. To identify possible early indicators of RTT, we analysed videotapes of two twin girls with RTT. The videotapes were analysed to (a) describe the motor and communicative development of this twin pair with RTT; and to (b) explore whether early abnormalities and their age of onset differed between the twins and were related to their later clinical phenotypes. The results indicated several neurodevelopmental abnormalities present before the children exhibited any obvious signs of regression. Abnormalities were evident in the motor, speech-language and communicative domains. These data support an emerging evidence base showing the presence of developmental abnormalities in children with RTT during the first year of life. The results have implications for early screening and clinical assessment.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal growth restriction and low birth weight have been linked to long-term alterations of health, presumably via adaptive modifications of the epigenome. Recent studies indicate a plasticity of the 11p15 epigenotype in response to environmental changes during early stages of human development.\nWe analyzed methylation levels at different 11p15 loci in 20 growth-discordant monozygotic twin pairs. Intrauterine development was discordant due to severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which was treated by fetoscopic laser coagulation of communicating vessels before 25\u00a0weeks of gestation. Methylation levels at age 4 were determined in blood and buccal cell-derived DNA by the single nucleotide primer extension reaction ion pair reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (SNuPE IP RP HPLC) assay. Methylation at LINE-1 repeats was analyzed as an estimate of global methylation.\nIn general, variance of locus-specific methylation levels appeared to be higher in buccal cell- as compared to blood cell-derived DNA samples. Paired analyses within the twin pairs revealed significant differences at only one CpG site (IGF2 dmr0 SN3 (blood), +1.9% in donors; P\u2009=\u20090.013). When plotting the twin pair-discordance in birth weight against the degree of discordance in site-specific methylation at age 4, only a few CpGs were found to interact (one CpG site each at IGF2dmr0 in blood/saliva DNA, one CpG at LINE-1 repeats in saliva DNA), with 26 to 36% of the intra-twin pair divergence at these sites explained by prenatal growth discordance. However, across the entire cohort of 40 children, site-specific methylation did not correlate with SD-scores for weight or length at birth. Insulin-like growth factor-II serum concentrations showed significant within-twin pair correlations at birth (R\u2009=\u20090.57) and at age 4 (R\u2009=\u20090.79), but did not differ between donors and recipients. They also did not correlate with the analyzed 11p15 methylation parameters.\nIn a cohort of 20 growth-discordant monozygotic twin pairs, severe alteration in placental blood supply due to TTTS appears to leave only weak, if any, epigenetic marks at the analyzed CpG sites at 11p15.",

    "abstract": "The present study used a monozygotic (MZ) cotwin-control (CTC) design to investigate associations between alcohol use and performance on the Iowa gambling task (IGT) in a sample of 96 adolescents (half female). The MZ CTC design is well suited to shed light on whether poor decision-making, as reflected on IGT performance, predisposes individuals to abuse substances or is a consequence of use. Participants completed structural MRI scans as well, from which we derived gray matter volumes for cortical and subcortical regions involved in IGT performance and reduced in adolescents with problematic alcohol use. Drinking was associated with poorer task performance and with reduced volume of the left lateral orbital-frontal cortex. CTC analyses indicated that the former was due to differences between members of twin pairs in alcohol use (suggesting a causal effect of alcohol), whereas the latter was due to factors shared by twins (consistent with a pre-existing vulnerability for use). Although these preliminary findings warrant replication, they suggest that normative levels of alcohol use may diminish the quality of adolescent decision-making and thus have potentially important public health implications.",

    "abstract": "In a broad attempt to improve the understanding of the genetic regulation of serum IgA levels, the heritability was estimated in over 12 000 Swedish twins, and a genome-wide association study was conducted in a subsample of 9617. Using the classical twin model the heritability was found to be significantly larger among females (61%) compared with males (21%), while contribution from shared environment (20%) was only seen for males. By modeling the genetic relationship matrix with IgA levels, we estimate that a substantial proportion (31%) of variance in IgA levels can ultimately be explained by the investigated SNPs. The genome-wide association study revealed significant association to two loci: (i) rs6928791 located on chromosome 6, 22 kb upstream of the gene SAM and SH3 domain containing 1 (SASH1) and (ii) rs13300483 on chromosome 9, situated 12 kb downstream the CD30 ligand (CD30L) encoding gene. The association to rs13300483 was replicated in two additional independent Swedish materials. The heritability of IgA levels is moderate and can partly be attributable to common variation in the CD30L locus.",

    "abstract": "Although prior studies have demonstrated that depression is associated with an overeating-binge eating dimension (OE-BE) phenotypically, little research has investigated whether familial factors contribute to the co-occurrence of these phenotypes, especially in community samples with multiple racial/ethnic groups. We examined the extent to which familial (i.e., genetic and shared environmental) influences overlapped between Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and OE-BE in a population-based sample and whether these influences were similar across racial/ethnic groups.\nParticipants included 3,226 European American (EA) and 550 African American (AA) young adult women from the Missouri Adolescent Female Twin Study. An adaptation of the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA) was administered to assess lifetime DSM-IV MDD and OE-BE. Quantitative genetic modeling was used to estimate familial influences between both phenotypes; all models controlled for age.\nThe best-fitting model, which combined racial/ethnic groups, found that additive genetic influences accounted for 44% (95% CI: 34%, 53%) of the MDD variance and 40% (25%, 54%) for OE-BE, with the remaining variances due to non-shared environmental influences. Genetic overlap was substantial (rg \u2009=\u2009.61 [.39, .85]); non-shared environmental influences on MDD and OE-BE overlapped weakly (re \u2009=\u2009.26 [.09, .42]).\nResults suggest that common familial influences underlie MDD and OE-BE, and the magnitude of familial influences contributing to the comorbidity between MDD and OE-BE is similar between EA and AA women. If racial/ethnic differences truly exist, then larger sample sizes may be needed to fully elucidate familial risk for comorbid MDD and OE-BE across these groups.",

A matched cohort group of MCDA twin gestations affected by TTTS was used for comparison.\nSixteen sets of DCTA triplets treated with laser photocoagulation of placental anastomoses were compared with 32 matched sets of MCDA twins. All of the 'singleton' fetuses in the triplet gestations survived to birth and to the end of the neonatal period. There were no differences in single or double survival or the rate of non-survivors to birth and at age 28\u2009days.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a rare case of subependymoma of the fourth ventricle in identical female twins is reported. Magnetic resonance imaging and CT showed nearly identical locations of the tumors in the fourth ventricle and similar growth patterns of the tumors in both sisters. Likewise, postoperative histopathological analysis of both tumors revealed the typical histological appearance of subependymomas. Subependymoma is a rare, low-grade glioma of the CNS, slowly growing and usually asymptomatic. If symptomatic, a subependymoma can in some cases lead to sudden death caused by pressure on the brainstem or decompensated secondary hydrocephalus. This case demonstrates the importance of detecting tumors early and thereby preventing symptoms arising from increasing intracranial pressure, and optimizing therapy options.",

    "abstract": "Reports on twin pairs concordant and discordant for Williams syndrome were published before, but no study unravelled sleep physiology in these cases yet. We aim to fill this gap by analyzing sleep records of a twin pair discordant for Williams syndrome extending our focus on presleep wakefulness and sleep spindling.\nWe performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of the 7q11.23 region of a 17 years old dizygotic opposite-sex twin pair discordant for Williams syndrome. Polysomnography of laboratory sleep at this age was analyzed and followed-up after 1.5 years by ambulatory polysomnography. Sleep stages scoring, EEG power spectra and sleep spindle analyses were carried out.\nThe twin brother showed reduced levels of amplification for all of the probes in the 7q11.23 region indicating a typical deletion spanning at least 1.038 Mb between FKBP6 and CLIP2. The results of the twin sister showed normal copy numbers in the investigated region.

    "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur. Several studies show increased risk of substance use disorders in ADHD, yet there is limited information related to how ADHD symptoms, autistic traits, and their combined effects are associated with nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis use and use disorders in the general population.\nCross-sectional interview and self-report questionnaire data from 3,080 young adult Australian twins (mean age 31.9 years) were used to assess ADHD symptoms, autistic traits, substance use, and substance use disorders. Substance use disorders-based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria-were assessed in the full sample as well as in those who reported substance use. Logistic regression analyses were used for comparing the associations between ADHD symptoms, autistic traits, substance use, and substance misuse after conduct disorder, sex, age, and zygosity were controlled for.\nGreater ADHD symptoms and autistic traits scores were associated with elevated levels of regular smoking; cannabis use; and nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis use disorders, even after conduct disorder was adjusted for. In contrast, for alcohol use, those with high autistic traits scores were less likely to report drinking to intoxication. However, upon initiation, and similar to the findings for nicotine and cannabis, they were at elevated risk for developing alcohol dependence.\nIncreased liability to ADHD and elevated autistic traits scores were associated with substance use and misuse, with the exception of alcohol use. Given the social underpinnings of drinking, persons with autistic traits may be less likely to engage in it; however, upon engagement in drinking, their vulnerability to alcohol dependence is elevated.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine which genetic and environmental influences contribute to individual differences in sleep duration in a sample of Croatian adolescent/early adult twins, as well as to investigate the relationship between personality and sleep duration. Participants included 339 twin pairs (105 monozygotic and 234 dizygotic) aged between 15 and 22 years. They reported on their average sleep duration and personality. The broad heritability estimate (additive and non-additive genetic influences) for sleep duration was 0.63, while personality estimates ranged between 0.47 and 0.62. Significant negative phenotypic associations with neuroticism and openness were mainly genetically mediated 100 and 80%, respectively. Only 6% of the sleep duration variance was explained by genetic influences shared with neuroticism and openness. In regression analysis, age, gender and five personality traits explained 5% of sleep duration variance, with neuroticism and openness as significant predictors. Comparison of short, moderate and long sleepers showed that participants in the short sleepers group had significantly higher neuroticism scores than groups of moderate and long sleepers, as well as a significantly higher openness score than the group of long sleepers. This indicates that personality traits of neuroticism and openness contribute to the prediction of sleep duration due to overlapping genetic influences that contribute to both these personality traits and sleep duration. However, as phenotypic overlap of personality and sleep duration is relatively weak, heritability of sleep duration is not only related to individual differences in personality traits, so future research needs to examine other phenotypic correlates of sleep duration.",

    "abstract": "Turkish twin brothers affected with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV (HSAN IV) are reported. Their clinical findings were generally typical for HSAN IV. Interestingly they both had preserved periodontal sensation. Mutation analysis of the NTRK1 gene showed a homozygous c.2001C>T substitution in exon 15 in both twins. This base substitution is predicted to change a polar, positively charged amino acid arginine to the highly active amino acid cystein at position 654 (p.Arg654Cys). The parents were heterozygous for the mutation. This mutation has been reported previously in one Japanese and one Arab patients. The preserved periodontal sensation has not previously been reported in patients affected with HSAN IV. This preserved sensation in our patients might have been through Ruffini endings, the periodontal mechanoreceptors which have been reported to be present in TrkA knockout mice. Here we report the first twins affected with HSAN IV and the observation that periodontal sensation is not affected by mutation in NTRK1.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated well-being and distress in 274 Israeli mothers of two-year-olds. Of these, 127 were mothers of singletons and 147 mothers of twins. The study examined the contribution to the explanation of well-being and distress of a range of variables relating to the mother, including sociodemographic characteristics, internal resources (attachment style, self-differentiation, and maternal self-efficacy), and external resources (marital quality and grandmothers' support). The findings showed that being a mother of a singleton or twins did not contribute to the explanation of variance in well-being or distress. Marital quality provided the strongest explained variance for both well-being and distress. Mother's health, attachment anxiety and self-differentiation also explained significant amounts of the variance. Several differences were found in the contribution of certain other variables, such as maternal grandmother's support, which contributed only to well-being. The results indicated the lesser role of sociodemographic variables, as opposed to the centrality of personality traits and marital quality, in the relationships with well-being and distress. Practical implications are discussed.",

Most clinical isolates express simultaneously a \u03b2-haemolysin/cytolysin and a red polyenic pigment, two phenotypic traits important for GBS identification in medical microbiology. The genetic determinants encoding the GBS haemolysin and pigment have been elucidated and the molecular structure of the pigment has been determined. The cyl operon involved in haemolysin and pigment production is regulated by the major two-component system CovS/R, which coordinates the expression of multiple virulence factors of GBS. Genetic analyses indicated strongly that the haemolysin activity was due to a cytolytic toxin encoded by cylE. However, the biochemical nature of the GBS haemolysin has remained elusive for almost a century because of its instability during purification procedures. Recently, it has been suggested that the haemolytic and cytolytic activity of GBS is due to the ornithine rhamnopolyenic pigment and not to the CylE protein. Here we review and summarize our current knowledge of the genetics, regulation and biochemistry of these twin GBS phenotypic traits, including their functions as GBS virulence factors.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the prospective risk of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) at \u226534 weeks' gestation for monochorionic and dichorionic twins receiving intensive antenatal fetal surveillance. The secondary objective was to calculate the incidence of prematurity-related neonatal morbidity/mortality rates that have been stratified by gestational week and chorionicity.\nA retrospective cohort study of all twins at \u226534 weeks' gestation who were delivered at the Medical University of South Carolina (1987-2010) was performed. Twins were cared for in a longstanding Twin Clinic with standardized treatment and surveillance protocols and supervised by a consistent Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist. Gestational age-specific fetal/neonatal mortality rates and composite neonatal morbidity rates were compared by chorionicity. A generalized linear mixed model was used to identify variables that were associated with increased composite neonatal morbidity.\nAmong 768 twin gestations (601 dichorionic and 167 monochorionic), only 1 dichorionic IUFD occurred. The prospective risk of IUFD at \u226534 weeks' gestation was 0.17% for dichorionic twins and 0% for monochorionic twins. Composite neonatal morbidity decreased with each gestational week (P < .0001). Morbidity was increased by white race, gestational diabetes mellitus, and elective indication for delivery. The nadir of composite neonatal morbidity occurred at 36/0-36/6 weeks' gestation for monochorionic twins and 37/0-37/6 weeks' gestation for dichorionic twins.\nOur data do not support concern for an increased risk of stillbirth in uncomplicated intensively monitored monochorionic twins at \u226534 weeks' gestation. However, our data do show significantly increased rates of neonatal morbidity in late preterm monochorionic twins that cannot be justified by a corresponding reduction in the risk of stillbirth. We believe that our data support delivery of uncomplicated monochorionic twins at 37 weeks' gestation.",

    "abstract": "Nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between highly similar duplicated sequences generates chromosomal deletions, duplications and inversions, which can cause diverse genetic disorders. Little is known about interindividual variation in NAHR rates and the factors that influence this. We estimated the rate of deletion at the CMT1A-REP NAHR hotspot in sperm DNA from 34 male donors, including 16 monozygotic (MZ) co-twins (8 twin pairs) aged 24 to 67 years old. The average NAHR rate was 3.5 \u00d7 10(-5) with a seven-fold variation across individuals. Despite good statistical power to detect even a subtle correlation, we observed no relationship between age of unrelated individuals and the rate of NAHR in their sperm, likely reflecting the meiotic-specific origin of these events. We then estimated the heritability of deletion rate by calculating the intraclass correlation (ICC) within MZ co-twins, revealing a significant correlation between MZ co-twins (ICC = 0.784, p = 0.0039), with MZ co-twins being significantly more correlated than unrelated pairs. We showed that this heritability cannot be explained by variation in PRDM9, a known regulator of NAHR, or variation within the NAHR hotspot itself. We also did not detect any correlation between Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking status or alcohol intake and rate of NAHR. Our results suggest that other, as yet unidentified, genetic or environmental factors play a significant role in the regulation of NAHR and are responsible for the extensive variation in the population for the probability of fathering a child with a genomic disorder resulting from a pathogenic deletion.",

    "abstract": "Studies of twin pairs discordant for autoimmune conditions provide a unique opportunity to explore contributing factors triggered by complex gene-environment interactions.\nIn this cross-sectional study, thirty-one monozygotic or dizygotic twin pairs discordant for myositis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), along with matched healthy controls were evaluated for antibodies against a panel of 21 autoantigens.\nAutoantibody profiling revealed that 42% of the affected twins showed significant seropositivity against autoantigens in the panel. In many of these affected twins, but none of healthy controls, there were high levels of autoantibodies detected against two or more autoantigens commonly seen in systemic autoimmune diseases including Ro52, Ro60, RNP-70 K and/or RNP-A. In contrast, only 10% (3/31) of the unaffected twins showed seropositivity and these immunoreactivities were against single autoantigens not seen in systemic autoimmune diseases. While no significant differences in autoantibodies were detected between the affected or unaffected twins against thyroid peroxidase, transglutaminase and several cytokines, 23% of the affected twins with myositis showed autoantibodies against the gastric ATPase. Analysis of the monozygotic twins separately also revealed a higher frequencies of autoantibodies in the affected twins compared to the unaffected twins (P = 0.046). Lastly, clinical analysis of both the affected monozygotic and dizygotic twins revealed that the autoantibody seropositive affected twins had a greater global disease activity score compared to seronegative affected twins (P = 0.019).\nThe findings of significantly more autoantibodies in the affected twins with myositis and SLE compared to the unaffected twins are consistent with potential non-genetic factors playing a role in autoantibody production and pathogenesis of these autoimmune disorders.",

    "results": "Autoantibody profiling revealed that 42% of the affected twins showed significant seropositivity against autoantigens in the panel. In many of these affected twins, but none of healthy controls, there were high levels of autoantibodies detected against two or more autoantigens commonly seen in systemic autoimmune diseases including Ro52, Ro60, RNP-70 K and/or RNP-A. In contrast, only 10% (3/31) of the unaffected twins showed seropositivity and these immunoreactivities were against single autoantigens not seen in systemic autoimmune diseases. While no significant differences in autoantibodies were detected between the affected or unaffected twins against thyroid peroxidase, transglutaminase and several cytokines, 23% of the affected twins with myositis showed autoantibodies against the gastric ATPase. Analysis of the monozygotic twins separately also revealed a higher frequencies of autoantibodies in the affected twins compared to the unaffected twins (P = 0.046). Lastly, clinical analysis of both the affected monozygotic and dizygotic twins revealed that the autoantibody seropositive affected twins had a greater global disease activity score compared to seronegative affected twins (P = 0.019).",

    "abstract": "Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a genodermatosis characterized by fragile skin forming blisters that heal invariably with scars. It is due to mutations in the COL7A1 gene encoding type VII collagen, the major component of anchoring fibrils connecting the cutaneous basement membrane to the dermis. Identical COL7A1 mutations often result in inter- and intra-familial disease variability, suggesting that additional modifiers contribute to RDEB course. Here, we studied a monozygotic twin pair with RDEB presenting markedly different phenotypic manifestations, while expressing similar amounts of collagen VII. Genome-wide expression analysis in twins' fibroblasts showed differential expression of genes associated with TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibition. In particular, decorin, a skin matrix component with anti-fibrotic properties, was found to be more expressed in the less affected twin. Accordingly, fibroblasts from the more affected sibling manifested a profibrotic and contractile phenotype characterized by enhanced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 expression, collagen I release and collagen lattice contraction. These cells also produced increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Both TGF-\u03b2 canonical (Smads) and non-canonical (MAPKs) pathways were basally more activated in the fibroblasts of the more affected twin. The profibrotic behaviour of these fibroblasts was suppressed by decorin delivery to cells. Our data show that the amount of type VII collagen is not the only determinant of RDEB clinical severity, and indicate an involvement of TGF-\u03b2 pathways in modulating disease variability. Moreover, our findings identify decorin as a possible anti-fibrotic/inflammatory agent for RDEB therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "We structurally compare, using solid-state NMR, two different polymorphs of \u03b1-synuclein which, as established recently, display contrasting biochemical properties, toxicity, and tropism for cells. We show that both forms, which can each be produced as a pure polymorph, are greatly different in secondary structure. While \u03b2-sheets are the dominating secondary structure elements for both polymorphs, they are markedly divergent in terms of number of elements, as well as their distribution. We demonstrate that all identified \u03b2-sheets feature an in-register parallel stacking for both polymorphs. The two forms show a different molecular arrangement in the unit cell and distinct dynamic features, while sharing a highly flexible C-terminal domain. The use of reproducible, well-identified conditions for sample preparation and the recording of identical NMR experiments allows for a direct comparison of the results.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) have known associations with cardiac complications. However, the cardiac load of dichorionic diamniotic (DD) twins with sIUGR (DD-sIUGR) remains unclear. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) is a convenient marker of cardiac dysfunction in neonates, and is elevated in MD twins with sIUGR (MD-sIUGR). However, there are no reports assessing serum NT-pro BNP levels in DD-sIUGR. Here, we aimed to clarify serum NT-pro BNP levels at birth in DD-sIUGR, and to compare them with those of MD-sIUGR. Forty-one DD twin pairs admitted to our center between October 2007 and January 2013 were enrolled in this study and separated into two groups: nine twins with sIUGR (DD-sIUGR group) and 32 twins without sIUGR (DD without sIUGR group). Sixteen MD twins with sIUGR (MD-sIUGR group) served as positive controls. Serum NT-pro BNP levels at birth in DD-sIUGR [median 2,115 pg/ml (range, 443-6,590 pg/ml)] were significantly higher than in DD without sIUGR [1,080 pg/ml (range, 313-3,470 pg/ml); p=0.001], and significantly lower than in MD twins with sIUGR [4,520 pg/ml (range, 529-62,400 pg/ml); p=0.04]. Serum NT-pro BNP levels between larger and smaller DD co-twins were significantly correlated (r = 0.582; p<0.0001). In conclusion, serum NT-pro BNP levels at birth in DD twins with sIUGR were higher than those without, and lower than in MD twins with sIUGR.",

    "abstract": "Parents of twins face many challenges and difficulties. These can include: the impact of a multiple birth on family life; the impact of preterm birth; coping and adapting to parenthood, particularly during the first year; managing the mismatch between support needed and support received; and the impact of all these factors on the health and wellbeing of themselves, their children and their wider family. The aim of this phenomenological study was to gain insight into parents' experiences and to inform service provision. Seven semistructured, audio-recorded interviews were conducted with mothers in their own home. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using qualitative methods. Five key themes were identified: Assumptions vs reality; Worries and concerns; Impact on self; Impact on others; and Sources of support. These themes provide insight into the challenges and difficulties encountered by mothers of twins. For most families, the care and support they received during this time was community based and the findings highlighted a need for healthcare professionals to be better informed about the advice and support needed by these families.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this qualitative research was to explore the needs and difficulties of mothers who had multiple babies at Sakarya County by focusing on their breastfeeding experience. Ten mothers who gave birth to multiple infants participated in the study voluntarily. The framework method of data analysis was applied systematically both within and across cases, with categories and themes identified by reading transcripts of interviews. Major themes generated from focus narrative interviews are described. These themes are: willingness of mothers to breastfeed and continue, management of breastfeeding, use of pacifier, daily life, instructions of healthcare personnel, and advices from practice of experienced mothers. This study showed that women were aware of the importance of mother's milk for their babies. They all, somehow, made intensive efforts to breastfeed their twins. Women who expect and/or have multiple babies need much more support and guidance, which may include advice for nutritional and daily care.",

    "abstract": "Second-born twins on average weigh less than first-born twins and have been reported at an elevated risk of perinatal mortality. Whether the risk differences depend on their relative birth size is unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate the association of birth order with perinatal mortality by birth order-specific weight difference in twin pregnancies.\nIn a retrospective cohort study of 258,800 twin pregnancies without reported congenital anomalies using the US matched multiple birth data 1995-2000 (the available largest multiple birth dataset), conditional logistic regression was applied to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of perinatal death adjusted for fetus-specific characteristics (sex, presentation, and birthweight for gestational age).\nComparing second vs first twins, the risks of perinatal death were similar if they had similar birthweights (within 5%) and were increasingly higher if second twins weighed progressively less (adjusted ORs were 1.37, 1.90, and 3.94 if weighed 5.0-14.9%, 15.0-24.9%, and \u226525.0% less, respectively), and progressively lower if they weighed increasingly more (adjusted ORs were 0.67, 0.63, and 0.36 if weighed 5.0-14.9%, 15.0-24.9%, and \u226525.0% more, respectively) (all P < .001). The perinatal mortality rates were not significantly different in cesarean deliveries or preterm (<37 weeks) vaginal deliveries but were significantly higher in second twins in term vaginal deliveries (3.1 vs 1.8 per 1000; adjusted OR, 2.15; P < .001).\nPerinatal mortality risk differences in second vs first twins depend on their relative birth size. Vaginal delivery at term is associated with a substantially greater risk of perinatal mortality in second twins.",

The incidence of early onset infections by vertical transmission has been drastically reduced in recent decades with the use of intravenous intrapartum prophylaxis. Progress in risk factor detection and prophylaxis of late-onset infection has however remained static. The ongoing modifications and improvements of the guidelines regarding prophylaxis, risk factors and prevention of the early-onset GBS disease have not addressed late-onset GBS infection in detail.

    "abstract": "To evaluate neonatal outcomes and clinical characteristics of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins with a large intertwin hemoglobin (Hb) difference at birth.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of MCDA twin gestations delivered at Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health between 2003 and 2012. Cases of pregnancy termination, acardiac twins or intrauterine death were excluded. A large intertwin Hb difference at birth was defined as > 8.0 g/dL according to the postnatal criteria for twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS). The intertwin reticulocyte count ratio (RCR) was calculated by dividing the reticulocyte count of the anemic twin by that of the polycythemic twin. Cases with Hb differences were divided into two groups according to the RCR, TAPS when the RCR was > 1.7 and acute fetofetal hemorrhage (AFFH) when the RCR was \u2264 1.7. Neonatal outcomes were compared between the TAPS and AFFH groups.\nDuring the study period, 432 MCDA twin pregnancies of a total of 532 born at our hospital were analyzed. There were 12 (2.8%) cases of a large intertwin Hb difference. The median gestational age at birth of these cases was 34 (range, 23-38) weeks, and all were delivered by Cesarean section. There were seven (1.6%) cases of TAPS and five (1.2%) of AFFH. The neonatal survival rate was 91.7%; in one pair of twins with TAPS neonatal death occurred. All (100%) cases with TAPS and two (40%) with AFFH required blood transfusion or partial-exchange transfusion for at least one infant.\nAlthough the incidence of TAPS and AFFH may be low in MCDA twins, many affected neonates required treatment for hematological abnormalities. Delivery of MCDA twins via Cesarean section does not appear to prevent AFFH, despite the absence of labor.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins have been widely studied to distinguish genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of human diseases. For renal agenesis, the one-sided absence of renal tissue, the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to its pathogenesis are still unclear. In this study of a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for congenital renal agenesis, the genomic profile was analyzed from a set of blood samples using high-throughput exome-capture sequencing to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variations (CNVs), and insertions and deletions (indels). Also, an epigenomic analysis used reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs). No discordant SNPs, CNVs, or indels were confirmed, but 514 DMRs were detected. KEGG analysis indicated the DMRs localized to 10 signaling pathways and 25 genes, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and 6 genes (FGF18, FGF12, PDGFRA, MAPK11, AMH, CTBP1) involved in organ development. Although methylation results from our adult patient and her sister may not represent the pattern that was present during kidney development, we could at least confirm a lack of obvious differences at the genome level, which suggests that nongenetic factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of renal agenesis.",

    "abstract": "Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a focal, idiopathic alteration of subchondral bone structure with the risk for secondary damage to adjacent articular cartilage and the development of premature osteoarthritis. The exact etiology of OCD is unknown, although repetitive microtrauma and vascular insufficiency have been previously described. A genetic predisposition has been suggested, but the existing evidence is sparse. There are multiple case reports of twins and siblings with OCD and a few large family series in the literature, promoting the theory that OCD may have a genetic component to its etiology. This article describes 2 sets of monozygotic twins presenting concurrently with OCD of their dominant knees, offering further support for a genetic component to the etiology of OCD. Interestingly, in both sets of twins, 1 was left-handed and 1 was right-handed. Both sets of twins had simultaneous presentations and clinical courses, lending support to a genetic element to OCD. The development of the OCD lesion in the dominant knee of each patient suggests an environmental influence, perhaps due to repetitive microtrauma and overuse. Recently, a genome-wide linkage study identified a prime candidate locus for OCD. However, despite the suggested association, genetic and developmental factors in the development of OCD remain relatively unstudied. The authors believe monozygotic twins provide an excellent clinical opportunity for future examination of the role of familial inheritance in the etiology of OCD.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable disease (~0.9) with a complex genetic etiology. It is initially characterized by altered cognitive ability which commonly includes impaired language and communication skills as well as fundamental deficits in social interaction. Despite the large amount of studies described so far, the high clinical diversity affecting the autism phenotype remains poorly explained. Recent studies suggest that rare genomic variations, in particular copy number variation (CNV), may account for a significant proportion of the genetic basis of ASD. The use of disease-discordant monozygotic twins represents a powerful strategy to identify de novo and inherited CNV in the disorder. Here we present the results of a comparative genome hybridization (CGH) analysis with a pair of monozygotic twins affected of ASD with significant differences in their clinical manifestations that specially affect speech language impairment and communication skills. Array CGH was performed in three different tissues: blood, saliva, and hair follicle, in an attempt to identify germinal and somatic CNV regions that may explain these differences. Our results argue against a role of large CNV rearrangements as a molecular etiology of the observed differences. This forwards future research to explore de novo point mutation and epigenomic alterations as potential explanations of the observed clinical differences.",

    "abstract": "Over recent decades interest in diagnosis and treatment of neuroendocrine tumours (NET) has steadily grown. The basis for diagnosis and therapy of NET with radiolabelled somatostatin (hsst) analogues is the variable overexpression of hsst receptors (hsst1-5 receptors). We hypothesized that radiometal derivatives of DOTA-iodo-Tyr(3)-octreotide analogues might be excellent candidates for somatostatin receptor imaging. We therefore explored the diagnostic potential of (68)Ga-DOTA-iodo-Tyr(3)-octreotate [(68)Ga-DOTA,3-iodo-Tyr(3),Thr(8)]octreotide ((68)Ga-HA-DOTATATE; HA, high-affinity) compared to the established (68)Ga-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate ((68)Ga-DOTATATE) in vivo.\nThe study included 23 patients with known somatostatin receptor-positive metastases from NETs, thyroid cancer or glomus tumours who were investigated with both (68)Ga-HA-DOTATATE and (68)Ga-DOTATATE. A patient-based and a lesion-based comparative analysis was carried out of normal tissue distribution and lesion detectability in a qualitative and a semiquantitative manner.\n(68)Ga-HA-DOTATATE and (68)Ga-DOTATATE showed comparable uptake in the liver (SUVmean 8.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2 vs. 9.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5, n.s.), renal cortex (SUVmean 13.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9 vs. 14.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7, n.s.) and spleen (SUVmean 24.0\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7 vs. 22.9\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3, n.s.). A somewhat higher pituitary uptake was found with (68)Ga-HA-DOTATATE (SUVmean 6.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 vs. 5.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1, p\u2009<\u20090.05). On a lesion-by-lesion basis a total of 344 lesions were detected. (68)Ga-HA-DOTATATE demonstrated 328 lesions (95.3% of total lesions seen), and (68)Ga-DOTATATE demonstrated 332 lesions (96.4%). The mean SUVmax of all lesions was not significantly different between (68)Ga-HA-DOTATATE and (68)Ga-DOTATATE (17.8\u2009\u00b1\u200911.4 vs. 16.7\u2009\u00b1\u200910.7, n.s.).\nOur analysis demonstrated very good concordance between (68)Ga-HA-DOTATATE and (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET data. As the availability and use of (68)Ga-HA-DOTATATE is not governed by patent restrictions it may be an attractive alternative to other (68)Ga-labelled hsst analogues.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twinning is rare in man and non-human primates. The current report describes a case of ischiopagus tripus conjoined Western Lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) twins. The female twins were joined at the umbilical and pelvic region, involving the liver, xiphoid, umbilicus, body wall and skin. Computed tomography revealed two complete spines. The combined pelvic space was formed by two sacra, each connected with two iliac bones. The twins were only conjoined by a common pubis. Cause of death was attributed to cardiac and circulatory collapse resulting from a large patent foramen ovale (8 mm in diameter) of one twin and neonatal asphyxia.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins are considered being genetically identical, therefore they cannot be differentiated using standard forensic DNA testing. Here we describe how identification of extremely rare mutations by ultra-deep next generation sequencing can solve such cases. We sequenced DNA from sperm samples of two twins and from a blood sample of the child of one twin. Bioinformatics analysis revealed five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in the twin father and the child, but not in the twin uncle. The SNPs were confirmed by classical Sanger sequencing. Our results give experimental evidence for the hypothesis that rare mutations will occur early after the human blastocyst has split into two, the origin of twins, and that such mutations will be carried on into somatic tissue and the germline. The method provides a solution to solve paternity and forensic cases involving monozygotic twins as alleged fathers or originators of DNA traces.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of lower respiratory tract disease and hospitalization in infants and young children. Infants of multiple births, who are often premature, might be more susceptible to developing a more severe RSV infection than singletons.\nTo assess the impact of multiple births on the severity of RSV infection and define risk factors for acquiring RSV infection in infants of multiple birth.\nClinical data on infants hospitalized with RSV infection between 2008 and 2010 were retrospectively collected.\nTwins comprised 7.6% (66/875) of hospitalized infants with RSV bronchiolitis during the study period. Infants in the twin group were younger (122.4 +/- 131.7 vs. 204.5 +/- 278.8 days, P = 0.014), had a lower mean gestational age (35.3 +/- 2.6 vs. 38.6 +/- 2.5 weeks, P < 0.001), and were more likely to have been born prematurely compared with singleton infants (65.6% vs. 13%, P < 0.001). On a multivariable logistic regression analysis, young age, early gestational age and male gender were the only variables identified as risk factors for pediatric intensive care unit admission (P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively). In contrast, the mere fact of a child being a twin was not found to be a significant risk factor for disease severity. In addition, if one twin is hospitalized due to RSV infection, the other has a 34% chance of also being hospitalized with bronchiolitis. Young age was a significant risk factor for hospitalization of the second twin (P < 0.001) CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that twins hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis do not have an increased risk for severe infection as compared to singletons. However, a twin of an infant hospitalized with RSV infection has a considerable risk of also being hospitalized with bronchiolitis, thus close monitoring is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Previous research suggests that aspects of facial surface morphology are heritable. Traditionally, heritability studies have used a limited set of linear distances to quantify facial morphology and often employ statistical methods poorly designed to deal with biological shape. In this preliminary report, we use a combination of 3D photogrammetry and landmark-based morphometrics to explore which aspects of face shape show the strongest evidence of heritability in a sample of twins.\n3D surface images were obtained from 21 twin pairs (10 monozygotic, 11 same-sex dizygotic). Thirteen 3D landmarks were collected from each facial surface and their coordinates subjected to geometric morphometric analysis. This involved superimposing the individual landmark configurations and then subjecting the resulting shape coordinates to a principal components analysis. The resulting PC scores were then used to calculate rough narrow-sense heritability estimates.\nThree principal components displayed evidence of moderate to high heritability and were associated with variation in the breadth of orbital and nasal structures, upper lip height and projection, and the vertical and forward projection of the root of the nose due to variation in the position of nasion.\nAspects of facial shape, primarily related to variation in length and breadth of central midfacial structures, were shown to demonstrate evidence of strong heritability. An improved understanding of which facial features are under strong genetic control is an important step in the identification of specific genes that underlie normal facial variation.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies and case reports show comorbidity of autism and epilepsy, suggesting some common molecular underpinnings of the two phenotypes. However, the relationship between the two, on the molecular level, remains unclear. Here, whole exome sequencing was performed on a family with identical twins affected with autism and severe, intractable seizures. A de novo variant was identified in the KCND2 gene, which encodes the Kv4.2 potassium channel. Kv4.2 is a major pore-forming subunit in somatodendritic subthreshold A-type potassium current (ISA) channels. The de novo mutation p.Val404Met is novel and occurs at a highly conserved residue within the C-terminal end of the transmembrane helix S6 region of the ion permeation pathway. Functional analysis revealed the likely pathogenicity of the variant in that the p.Val404Met mutant construct showed significantly slowed inactivation, either by itself or after equimolar coexpression with the wild-type Kv4.2 channel construct consistent with a dominant effect. Further, the effect of the mutation on closed-state inactivation was evident in the presence of auxiliary subunits that associate with Kv4 subunits to form ISA channels in vivo. Discovery of a functionally relevant novel de novo variant, coupled with physiological evidence that the mutant protein disrupts potassium current inactivation, strongly supports KCND2 as the causal gene for epilepsy in this family. Interaction of KCND2 with other genes implicated in autism and the role of KCND2 in synaptic plasticity provide suggestive evidence of an etiological role in autism.",

    "abstract": "Dyspnea has not been widely used as a proxy measure of fitness. Because dyspnea score is simple to obtain, it could be a screening tool for identifying individuals with low fitness and increased mortality risk. The aim was to study how baseline dyspnea, and changes in it, predicts all-cause mortality.\nThe prospective Finnish Twin Cohort includes all same-sex twin pairs born in Finland before 1958. Dyspnea was measured with a four-question modified Medical Research Council scale. The level and change in dyspnea between 1975 and 1981 were used as the baseline predictors. Altogether, 21,379 twin individuals (8672 complete twin pairs) had answered dyspnea questions in 1975 and 1981. Cox proportional hazards model was used for mortality analysis starting from the 1981 response date until December 31, 2010.\nIncreased mortality was observed among individuals with persistent dyspnea (dyspnea in 1975 and 1981); full covariate adjusted HR of death was 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 1.31-1.52), whereas the HR for dyspnea developers and those with dyspnea remission were 1.16 (1.05-1.25) and 1.07 (0.97-1.19), respectively, compared with asymptomatic individuals. Among healthy subjects at 1981 baseline, the corresponding HR values were 1.34 (1.16-1.54), 1.15 (0.97-1.37), and 1.05 (0.89-1.23). Within-pair analyses of death discordant pairs showed a fully adjusted HR for persistent dyspnea of 1.47 (1.23-1.77) for all twin pairs and 2.64 (1.21-5.74) for healthy monozygotic pairs.\nPersistent dyspnea predicts increased mortality during a 28-yr follow-up even among individuals without clinically overt disease known to associate with dyspnea. The dyspnea score, which can be easily obtained and correlates with fitness outcomes, could be a screening tool for identifying unfit individuals at an increased mortality risk.",

    "abstract": "Mode of delivery remains a topic of debate in vertex/non-vertex twin pregnancies. We used the WHO Global Survey dataset to determine the risk of adverse maternal/perinatal outcomes associated with presentation of the second twin, following vaginal delivery of a vertex first twin.\nWe analysed a derived dataset of twin pregnancies \u2265 32 weeks gestation where the first twin was vertex and delivered vaginally. Maternal, delivery and neonatal characteristics and adverse outcomes were reported by presentation of the second twin. Logistic regression models (adjusted for maternal and perinatal confounders, mode of delivery and region) were developed to determine odds of adverse outcomes associated with presentation.\n1,424 twin pregnancies were included, 25.9% of these had a non-vertex second twin and Caesarean was more common in non-vertex presentations (6.2% vs 0.9%, p < 0.001). While the odds of Apgar < 7 at 5 minutes were higher in non-vertex presenting second twins (16.0% vs 11.4%, AOR 1.42 95% CI 1.01-2.00), the odds of maternal ICU admission (4.6% vs 1.7%, AOR 1.30, 95% CI 0.88-1.94), blood transfusion (6.0% vs 3.4%, AOR 1.23, 95% CI 0.67-2.25), stillbirth (7.6% vs 4.7%, AOR 1.15, 95% CI 0.72-1.73), early neonatal death (3.8% vs 2.1%, AOR 1.68, 95% CI 0.96-2.94), and NICU admission (26.6% vs 23.2%, AOR 0.93, 95% CI 0.62-1.39) were not.\nAfter a vaginal delivery of a vertex first twin, non-vertex presentation of the second twin is associated with increased odds of Apgar <7 at 5 minutes, but not of other maternal/perinatal outcomes.

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are rare, with a reported incidence of 0.19 per 10,000 pregnancies in Europe. We discuss four spontaneous conjoined twin pregnancies presenting to a tertiary referral centre from 2005 to 2011, diagnosed on antenatal dating ultrasound. The cases were monitored closely throughout pregnancy by a multidisciplinary team, with serial surveillance, including ultrasound, fetal echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, amniocentesis and further referral to cardiology and paediatric surgery specialists, where indicated. Three female sets were determined antenatally to be not surgically separable; these infants were managed palliatively following a live birth. The male set of conjoined twins was accepted for surgical separation at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, which was successfully performed electively at 4 months. Of interest, all four parents reside within 20 km of each other, representing a possible cluster of cases. The incidence of conjoined twins in our local population is approximately 0.63 per 10,000 over an 8-year period from 2005 to 2012. This case series highlights a cluster of conjoined twins, managed to viability and delivered in a tertiary referral centre.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are the most rare form of monozygotic twinning occurring when there is incomplete division of the embryonic disc after day 13 post conception. This is associated with a very high risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Prognosis is dependent on the site and extent of fusion and the degree of sharing of vital organs. Most conjoined twins die in utero or in the early neonatal period. However less severe cases can be successfully separated. This is a review of the types of conjoined twinning, an historical perspective and a case of a rare form known as dicephalus dipus dibrachius (two heads and a single body with two arms and two legs).",

Repeated ultrasound evaluations confirmed intrauterine growth restriction in both twins and polyhydramnios as the cause of imminent preterm labour. After initiation of haemodialysis treatment, ultrasound evaluation showed a significant decrease in amniotic fluids, and also reduction in blood urea nitrogen and in clinical complaints could be observed. At a gestational age of 28 weeks + 4 days, delivery was performed by Caesarean section.

Analyses included: DNA isolation, quantitative and qualitative assessment of DNA preparations, hybridization analysis of SLS type as well as of MLS type, and analysis of microsatellite sequences with regard to polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction.\nThe presence of additional fragments of DNA in peripheral blood lymphocytes was found in four out of fifty pairs of monozygotic twins (8%) at locus D7S21 (7p22, n = 3) and locus D12S11 (12q24.3, n = 1). In these cases, the presence of additional DNA fragments was also proved by analysis of microsatellite sequence polymorphisms at loci HUMPLA2A1 (pancreatic phospholipase A-2, 12q23), HUMCYARO (cytochrome P450, 15q21.1) and HUMvWF (von Willebrand factor, 12p13).\nThe results of our study confirm the occurrence of chimerism in twins and constitutes the starting point for further studies aimed at determining the clinical significance of chimerism in twins both for women and fetuses.",

    "abstract": "There has been a long-standing debate on the complex correlation between the development of human hand preference and brain lateralization. Handedness, used as a proxy for cerebral lateralization, is a topic of considerable importance because of its potential to reveal the mechanisms of the underlying pathophysiology of problems related to brain development or cognitive systems. Twin studies, which represent an important method of research in human genetics, would provide valuable suggestions to the studies on the relationship between lateralization and cognitive systems. Many studies have been performed using twin subjects; however, the results are inconsistent, partly because of sample size, background assumptions, data limits or inaccuracies, incorrect zygosity classification, and/or lack of birth histories. In summary, within the long history and large number of twin studies performed on handedness, a surprisingly large number of controversial findings have been reported, suggesting the complicated nature of this phenotype. In this mini review, the wide variety of twin studies on human handedness performed to date are introduced.",

    "abstract": "Emotional lability is recognized as an associated feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the degree of phenotypic and etiologic overlap between emotional lability and the ADHD dimensions of hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention remains unclear. The present study examines these associations in a large, community twin sample.\nStructural equation models were fit to data from 1,920 child and adolescent twin pairs (age range, 5-18 years). Symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity (HI) and inattention (IA) were assessed using a modified version of the DuPaul rating scale, completed by parents. Symptoms of emotional lability (EL) were assessed using the parent-rated Conners 10-item scale.\nThere were moderate to strong phenotypic correlations between HI, IA, and EL. Multivariate twin modeling revealed that a common pathway model best accounted for the covariance among these dimensions, represented by a highly heritable latent factor. Ad hoc analyses confirmed that all additive genetic influences on HI, IA, and EL were shared, and identified a significantly stronger association of EL with the latent ADHD factor in older than in younger individuals.\nEmotional lability was phenotypically and genetically associated with hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention in children and adolescents. The finding that a single, heritable, latent factor accounted for covariation among these phenotypes indicates that their co-occurrence is primarily the result of overlapping genetic effects. These data support the hypothesis that emotional lability is etiologically relevant to the core ADHD phenotype, and that it should be targeted in assessment and treatment in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic-diamniotic twins are usually monozygotic twins and known to be associated with adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes. Cases of discordant karyotype of monozygotic twins are rare and most involves sex chromosomes. We present the first case of monochorionic twins with discordant karyotype manifested as mosaic trisomy 14 in one twin (B) and a normal karyotype in the other (A). We describe the postmortem pathological and imaging findings of the trisomic twin and for the first time neuropathological findings of this entity. Metaphase chromosome analysis of twin B using fetal tissue showed a 47,XX, +14 karyotype. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) using fetal tissue revealed 38% mosaicism. CMA with placental tissue from both sides demonstrated normal karyotype and confirmed monozygosity, highlighting the value of array based testing on diagnosing mosaicism and zygosity.",

    "abstract": "Although twin gestation is well recognized to be associated with impaired fetal and postnatal growth, specific data about body composition of twins in the first month of life are scarce.\nThe aim of this study was to compare the body composition of twins, evaluated with air-displacement plethysmography, to that of singletons of similar gestational age and adequacy of growth, during the first month of life. We tested the hypothesis that the quality of growth would be similar.\nAnthropometric and air-displacement plethysmography measurements were performed in 18 pairs of twins and in 36 singleton neonates, longitudinally, from birth to the 30th day of life. Each twin was matched to a singleton infant of similar gestational age and birth weight z-score.\nWith regard to anthropometric measures, the only difference was a lower weight in twins versus singletons on the 15th day of life. With regard to body composition, we did not find any difference between groups at any time point. Fat mass increased significantly from day 1 to day 30 in both twins and singletons.\nIn terms of body composition, twins do not differ from singletons of similar gestational age and weight, either at birth or in early postnatal life.",

    "abstract": "The resting state default mode network (DMN) has been shown to characterize a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Evidence suggests an underlying genetic basis for this network and hence could serve as potential endophenotype for these disorders. Heritability is a defining criterion for endophenotypes. The DMN is measured either using a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan or by extracting resting state activity from task-based fMRI. The current study is the first to evaluate heritability of this task-derived resting activity. 250 healthy adult twins (79 monozygotic and 46 dizygotic same sex twin pairs) completed five cognitive and emotion processing fMRI tasks. Resting state DMN functional connectivity was derived from these five fMRI tasks. We validated this approach by comparing connectivity estimates from task-derived resting activity for all five fMRI tasks, with those obtained using a dedicated task-free resting state scan in an independent cohort of 27 healthy individuals. Structural equation modeling using the classic twin design was used to estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to variance for the resting-state DMN functional connectivity. About 9-41% of the variance in functional connectivity between the DMN nodes was attributed to genetic contribution with the greatest heritability found for functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and right inferior parietal nodes (P<0.001). Our data provide new evidence that functional connectivity measures from the intrinsic DMN derived from task-based fMRI datasets are under genetic control and have the potential to serve as endophenotypes for genetically predisposed psychiatric and neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies are an incomparable source of investigation to shed light on genetic and non-genetic components of neurodegenerative diseases, as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Detailed clinicopathologic correlations using twin longitudinal data and post-mortem examinations are mostly missing. We describe clinical and pathologic findings of seven monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. Our findings show good agreement between clinical and pathologic diagnoses in the majority of the twin pairs, with greater neuropathologic concordance in MZ than DZ twins. Greater neuropathologic concordance was found for \u03b2-amyloid than tau pathology within the pairs. ApoE4 was associated with higher \u03b2-amyloid and earlier dementia onset, and importantly, higher frequency of other co-occurring brain pathologies, regardless of the zygosity. Dementia onset, dementia duration, difference between twins in age at dementia onset and at death, did not correlate with AD pathology. These clinicopathologic correlations of older identical and fraternal twins support the relevance of genetic factors in AD, but not their sufficiency to determine the pathology, and consequently the disease, even in monozygotic twins. It is the interaction among genetic and non-genetic risks which plays a major role in influencing, or probably determining, the degeneration of those brain circuits associated with pathology and cognitive deficits in AD.",

    "abstract": "Reduction of fetal number has been offered in high order multiple gestations but is still controversial in triplets. Since recent advances in neonatal and obstetric care have greatly improved outcome, the benefits of multifetal pregnancy reduction (MFPR) may no longer exist in triplet gestations.\nTo evaluate if fetal reduction of triplets to twins improves outcome.\nWe analyzed the outcome of 80 triplet gestations cared for at Rambam Health Care Campus in the last decade; 34 families decided to continue the pregnancy as triplets and 46 opted for MFPR to twins.\nThe mean gestational age at delivery was 32.3 weeks for triplets and 35.6 weeks for twins after MFPR. Severe prematurity (delivery before 32 gestational weeks) occurred in 37.5% and 7% of twins. Consequently, the rate of severe neonatal morbidity (respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage) and of neonatal death was significantly higher in unreduced triplets, as was the length of hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (31.4 vs. 15.7, respectively). Overall, the likelihood of a family with triplets to take home all three neonates was 80%; the likelihood to take home three healthy babies was 71.5%.\nMFPR reduces the risk of severe prematurity and the neonatal morbidity of triplets. A secondary benefit is the reduction of cost of care per survivor. Our results indicate that MFPR should be offered in triplet gestations.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined well-being and personal growth in mothers (n\u2009=\u2009414) 1\u2009year after childbirth. We examined the contribution of the event characteristics (birth of singletons or twins, full- or pre-term babies, first or non-first child, spontaneous pregnancy or fertility treatments and infant temperament), internal resources (attachment anxiety and avoidance) and external resources (marital quality and maternal grandmother's support). Regressions indicated that having a first child, child's easier temperament, lower attachment anxiety and avoidance, grandmother's emotional support and some aspects of the spousal relationships contributed to well-being. Personal growth was found to be related to the birth of a pre-term baby or babies, positively associated with maternal grandmother's support, and the marital quality of parenthood, and negatively with mothers' education. Beyond the findings that well-being and personal growth are related to the availability of certain resources, the current study demonstrates that the two outcomes are separate phenomena that reveal different patterns of associations with other variables. Several explanations for the findings are proposed, and practical implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "In term newborns meconium ileus is frequently associated with cystic fibrosis. Reports on meconium ileus in preterm infants being diagnosed with cystic fibrosis early after birth are very scarce. Associations between genotype and phenotype in cystic fibrosis and its particular comorbidities have been reported.\nTwo extremely preterm twin infants (26 weeks of gestation) born from a Malaysian mother and a Caucasian father were presented with typical signs of meconium ileus. Despite immediate surgery both displayed a unique and finally lethal course. Mutation analysis revealed a novel, probably pathogenic cystic fibrosis mutation, p.Cys524Tyr. The novel mutation might explain the severity of disease next to typical sequelae of prematurity.\nPreterm neonates with meconium ileus have to be evaluated for cystic fibrosis beyond ethnical boundaries, but may take devastating clinical courses despite early treatment. The novel, potentially pathogenic CF mutation p.Cys524Tyr might be associated with severe meconium ileus in neonates. Disease-modifying loci are important targets for intestinal comorbidity of cystic fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine heritability estimates of treatment responses to a 10% hydrogen peroxide strip-based whitening system in twins. Eighty-five twin pairs were randomly assigned to 10% hydrogen peroxide whitening strips or placebo strips without peroxide. Both twins (monozygotic or dizygotic) received the same treatment. Maxillary teeth were treated for 30 minutes twice daily for 7 days. Efficacy was measured objectively as L* (light-dark), a* (red-green), and b* (yellow-blue) color change from digital images at baseline (\u2206) and day 8. Heritability estimates for tooth whitening treatment responses for changes from day 8 to baseline were obtained using variance-component methodologies. Whitening treatment responses were highly heritable (h(2) = 71.0) for \u2206b* and \u2206a*(p < .0001), but not for \u2206L* (h(2) = 27.0), which was essentially modulated by environmental factors. This study has demonstrated that both genetic and environmental factors significantly contributed to seven-day whitening treatment responses achieved with 10% hydrogen peroxide strips.",

    "abstract": "The Older Australian Twins Study (OATS) is a major longitudinal study of twins, aged \u2265 65 years, to investigate genetic and environmental factors and their interactions in healthy brain ageing and neurocognitive disorders. The study collects psychiatric, neuropsychological, cardiovascular, metabolic, biochemical, neuroimaging, genomic and proteomic data, with two-yearly assessments, and is currently in its third wave. The initial cohort comprises 623 individuals (161 monozygotic and 124 dizygotic twin pairs; 1 MZ triplets; 27 single twins and 23 non-twin siblings), of whom 426 have had wave 2 assessment. A number of salient findings have emerged thus far which assist in the understanding of genetic contributions to cognitive functions such as processing speed, executive ability and episodic memory, and which support the brain reserve hypothesis. The heritability of brain structures, both cortical and subcortical, brain spectroscopic metabolites and markers of small vessel disease, such as lacunar infarction and white matter hyperintensities, have been examined and can inform future genetic investigations. Work on amyloid imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging is proceeding and epigenetic studies are progressing. This internationally important study has the potential to inform research into cognitive ageing in the future, and offers an excellent resource for collaborative work.",

    "abstract": "Personality disorders (PDs) reduce global functioning, are associated with high levels of work disability, and are thus also likely to influence long-term sick leave (LTSL). Previous research has indicated significant genetic influence on both DSM-IV PDs and LTSL. To what degree genes contributing to PDs also influence LTSL has not been investigated. The aims of the current study were to investigate which PDs were significantly associated with LTSL, to what extent the genetic contributions to these PDs account for the heritability of LTSL, and to explore the hypothesis of a causal association between PDs and LTSL. The sample consisted of 2,771 young, adult Norwegian twins, born 1967-1979. PDs were assessed using the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality (SIDP-IV). The age range for the interview was 20-32. The data were subsequently linked to public records of LTSL (sick leave >16 days) up to 11 years later. The odds ratio for being in the highest LTSL category (>15% sick leave) when fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria for any PD diagnosis was 2.6 (1.8-3.8, 95% CI). Dimensional representations of schizotypal, paranoid, and borderline PD were independently and significantly associated with LTSL. The heritability of LTSL was 0.50. Genetic factors shared with the PDs accounted for 20% of this. The association between PDs and LTSL was due to shared genetic and not environmental influences, and was mainly explained by one common genetic factor. The hypothesis of a causal association was not supported, indicating that the association is explained by overlapping genetic liability between PDs and LTSL.",

    "abstract": "Several recent studies using instrumental variables based on changes in compulsory schoolleaving age laws have estimated the causal effect of schooling on health outcomes and health-related behaviors in the U.K. Despite using the same identification strategy and similar datasets, no consensus has been reached. We contribute to the literature by providing results for the U.K. using a different research design and a different dataset. Specifically, we estimate the effect of schooling on health outcomes (obesity and physical health) and health-related behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption and exercise) for women through within-MZ twins estimates using the TwinsUK database. For physical health, alcohol consumption and exercise, the within-MZ twins estimates are uninformative about whether there is a causal effect. However, we find (1) that the significant association between schooling and smoking status is due to unobserved endowments that are correlated with schooling and smoking (2) there is some indication that more schooling reduces the body mass index for women, even once these unobserved endowments have been controlled for.",

    "abstract": "To demonstrate that vaginal delivery is a safe alternative to hysterotomy when planning pregnancy termination of late-second-trimester conjoined twins. We present two cases of conjoined twins in the late second trimester desiring pregnancy termination.\nThe first case involved a multiparous 29-year-old woman at 23 6/7 weeks of gestation with thoraco-omphalopagus conjoined twins. The second case involved an 18-year-old primigravid woman at 25 1/7 weeks of gestation with pyopagus conjoined twins. Both desired pregnancy termination and to avoid hysterotomy. Inductions were initiated with Laminaria and augmented with vaginal misoprostol or oxytocin. Both patients had uncomplicated vaginal deliveries of intact conjoined twins without significant maternity morbidity.\nInduction of labor and vaginal delivery can be a safe method for late-second-trimester termination of pregnancies with conjoined twins.",

He presented hypogonadic features with undetectable testosterone levels and a height in accordance with mid-parental height. He had a monozygous sibling (case 2) who did not show clinical signs of hypogonadism and whose height exceeded mid-parental height. Both patients had presented language disorders since childhood. The karyotype of lymphocytes in peripheral blood of both subjects was compatible with mosaic Klinefelter's syndrome (46,XY/47,XXY). Testosterone replacement was initiated in case 1. Lack of testicular involvement due to mosaicism and the overexpression of the SHOX gene in case 2 could explain the marked differences in phenotype in these homozygous twins.",

Data regarding short-term neonatal outcome were recorded. Growth parameters were recorded at birth and again at 1 year of age, as collected by phone interview.\nAt 1 year of age, the gap was significantly reduced between the group of smaller twins and the group of larger twins on all the parameters studied. Discordance in weight decreased from a mean of 22% at birth (calculated from the weight of the larger twin) to 8.9%, in length from 6.5% to 2.5% and in head circumference from 5.5% to 1.3% at 1 year of age. While length and head circumference (HC) z-scores improved in both the large and the small siblings, weight z-score decreased significantly among the large twins and decreased mildly among the small twins.\nThe gaps in growth parameters between the smaller twins of preterm discordant twins and their larger siblings are significantly reduced during the first year of life. The impact of the differential growth patterns between the two siblings should be further evaluated.",

Discordance in weight decreased from a mean of 22% at birth (calculated from the weight of the larger twin) to 8.9%, in length from 6.5% to 2.5% and in head circumference from 5.5% to 1.3% at 1 year of age. While length and head circumference (HC) z-scores improved in both the large and the small siblings, weight z-score decreased significantly among the large twins and decreased mildly among the small twins.",

    "abstract": "In species of mammals that habitually bear single offspring, like most anthropoid primates, the occurrence of twins is expected to impose considerable energetic costs on the caretakers. The question then arises of how caregivers cope with the potentially increased costs of raising twins. These increased costs should lead to differing developmental rates in twins when compared to singletons, and/or to changes in the caregivers' behavior. Likewise, time budgets of parents of singletons are expected to differ from those of adults without offspring. Additionally, if twinning was an adaptive response to favorable ecological conditions, it should be more likely in years with high food abundance. Following the birth in 2011 of two sets of twins in a wild population of pair-living Azara's owl monkeys (Aotus azarae) in Northern Argentina, we used long-term demographic, behavioral, and phenological data to compare (a) the proportion of time that singleton and twin infants were carried by either parent; (b) adult time budgets and ranging behavior in groups with zero, one, or two infants; and (c) the availability of food in 2011 with food availability in other years. Twins, like singletons, were carried nearly exclusively by the male, and they were carried slightly more than singletons, suggesting a relatively inflexible pattern of infant care in the species. Time budgets showed that twin parents foraged more and moved less than singleton parents or groups without infants, despite the fact that phenological data indicate that fruit availability in 2011 was not substantially higher than in some of the other years. Overall, twinning thus presumably increased costs to breeders, especially males, but its effect on animals' long-term reproductive success remains unclear.",

    "abstract": "To explore whether there exist differences in cognitive development between singletons and twins born after in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).\nA total of 566 children were recruited for the study, including 388 children (singletons, n=175; twins, n=213) born after IVF and 178 children (singletons, n=87; twins, n=91) born after ICSI. The cognitive development was assessed using the Chinese-Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (C-WISC).\nFor all pre-term offspring, all the intelligence quotient (IQ) items between singletons and twins showed no significant differences no matter if they were born after IVF or ICSI. There was a significant difference in the cognitive development of IVF-conceived full-term singletons and twins. The twins born after IVF obtained significantly lower scores than the singletons in verbal IQ (containing information, picture & vocabulary, arithmetic, picture completion, comprehension, and language), performance IQ (containing maze, visual analysis, object assembly, and performance), and full scale IQ (P<0.05). The cognitive development of full-term singletons and twins born after ICSI did not show any significant differences. There was no significant difference between the parents of the singletons and twins in their characteristics where data were collected, including the age of the mothers, the current employment status, the educational backgrounds, and areas of residence. There were also no consistent differences in the duration of pregnancy, sex composition of the children, age, and height between singletons and twins at the time of our study although there existed significant differences between the two groups in the sex composition of the full-term children born after ICSI (P<0.05).\nCompared to the full-term singletons born after IVF, the full-term twins have lower cognitive development. The cognitive development of full-term singletons and twins born after ICSI did not show any significant differences. For all pre-term offspring, singletons and twins born after IVF or ICSI, the results of the cognitive development showed no significant differences.",

    "abstract": "Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) by random massively parallel sequencing of maternal plasma DNA for multiple pregnancies is a promising new option for prenatal care since conventional non-invasive screening for fetal trisomies 21, 18 and 13 has limitations and invasive diagnostic methods bear a higher risk for procedure related fetal losses in the case of multiple gestations compared to singletons. In this study, in a retrospective blinded analysis of stored twin samples, all 16 samples have been determined correctly, with four trisomy 21 positive and 12 trisomy negative samples. In the prospective part of the study, 40 blood samples from women with multiple pregnancies have been analyzed (two triplets and 38 twins), with two correctly identified trisomy 21 cases, confirmed by karyotyping. The remaining 38 samples, including the two triplet pregnancies, had trisomy negative results. However, NIPT is also prone to quality issues in case of multiple gestations: the minimum total amount of cell-free fetal DNA must be higher to reach a comparable sensitivity and vanishing twins may cause results that do not represent the genetics of the living sibling, as described in two case reports.",

    "abstract": "The understanding of relative effects of genetics and environmental factors on mandible growth would increase effectiveness of orthodontic therapy and treatment planning. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether the skeletal morphology of mandible is phenotypically alike in two individuals in a pair of young adult monozygotic (MZ) twins.\nThe 90 twin pairs were classified as MZ by 15 specific DNA markers and Amel fragment. Cephalometric analysis of mandible morphology using 27 parameters was done and Pearson's intra-pair correlation coefficient for each variable was calculated.\nThe highest correlations of cephalometric variables between two individuals in the same MZ twins pair was in the total mandibular and corpus length (r=0.94). The lowest correlations was established for depth of antigonial notch (r=0.65) and articular angle (r=0.68) in female pairs. Statistically significant differences (p \u2264 0.05) of intra-pair correlation coefficients between genders was found only for total mandibular length (distances Co-Gn and Ar-Gn).\nMandibular length has highest intra-pair correlation coefficient among similar linear cephalometric variables in MZ twins. The females demonstrated greater variability of mandible skeletal cephalometric measurements within the MZ twin pair than the men.",

Family investigation, clinical, radiographic examination and molecular analysis were performed in both girls. Molecular analysis confirmed the monozygosity by deoxyribonucleic acid chip technology. One twin presented tooth agenesis in left upper lateral incisor and peg-shaped on the contra lateral side while the other twin had no dental alterations. The dental casts study employed digital caliper to compare morphological dimensions and showed alteration only in peg-shaped tooth. In conclusion, this study provide support that one or more mutated gene could cause discordances in dental phenotype in these monozygotic twins.",

Hereditary neuroblastoma has not been described in this context.

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is the most common viable chromosomal disorder with intellectual impairment and several other developmental abnormalities. Here, we report the generation and characterization of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21 in order to eliminate the effects of the variability of genomic background. The alterations observed by genetic analysis at the iPSC level and at first approximation in early development illustrate the developmental disease transcriptional signature of Down syndrome. Moreover, we observed an abnormal neural differentiation of Down syndrome iPSCs in vivo when formed teratoma in NOD-SCID mice, and in vitro when differentiated into neuroprogenitors and neurons. These defects were associated with changes in the architecture and density of neurons, astroglial and oligodendroglial cells together with misexpression of genes involved in neurogenesis, lineage specification and differentiation. Furthermore, we provide novel evidence that dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) on chromosome 21 likely contributes to these defects. Importantly, we found that targeting DYRK1A pharmacologically or by shRNA results in a considerable correction of these defects.",

    "abstract": "The inheritance of cognitive functions and personality is still a problem under investigation. A classical method, investigation of twins, is often used to find relative contributions from genetics and the environment to quantitative traits. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible influence of heredity on cognitive functions (by applying the Raven test) and personality traits (according to the Eysenck's theory) in twins.\nIn total, 139 pairs of same-sex twins were investigated. The zygosity of the twin pairs was confirmed through genotyping with 15 molecular DNA markers. Constructive thinking was assessed using the Raven test. Personality assessment was conducted using the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) in Lithuanian.\nThe difference in the total number of incorrect solutions between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs younger than 15 years was not significant; however, in the group older than 15 years, this difference was found to be significant. Based on the total number of incorrect solutions, the concordance in the MZ twins was greater than in the DZ twins. The same tendency was found with cumulative EPQ scores on the extraversion scale.\nThe results imply that the quality of cognitive functions and personality traits (extraversion) can be influenced by heredity. This confirms previous findings on the heritability of cognitive factors and personality traits.",

    "abstract": "It has been postulated that androgen overexposure in a susceptible person leads to excessive brain masculinization and the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype. In this study, the responses to estradiol (E2), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) on B-lymphocytes from ASD subjects and controls are compared. B cells were obtained from 11 ASD subjects, their unaffected fraternal twins, and nontwin siblings. Controls were obtained from a different cell bank. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and sodium 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) reduction levels were measured after incubation with different concentrations of E2, DHT, and DDE. XTT/LDH ratio, representative of mitochondria number per cell, was calculated. E2, DHT, and DDE all cause \"U\"-shaped growth curves, as measured by LDH levels. ASD B cells show less growth depression compared to siblings and controls (P < 0.01). They also have reduced XTT/LDH ratios (P < 0.01) when compared to external controls, whereas siblings had values of XTT/LDH between ASD and external controls. B-lymphocytes from people with ASD exhibit a differential response to E2, DHT, and hormone disruptors in regard to cell growth and mitochondrial upregulation when compared to non-ASD siblings and external controls. Specifically, ASD B-lymphocytes show significantly less growth depression and less mitochondrial upregulation when exposed to these effectors. A mitochondrial deficit in ASD individuals is implied.",

    "abstract": "About 13% of twins are born before 34 weeks and 7% before 32 weeks. The prediction of preterm birth in twins is based on the same tests as in singleton pregnancies. In twin pregnancies, the cut-off for short cervix at the second trimester scan is less than 25 mm (compared with 15 mm in singletons); length less than 20 mm is associated with 42% risk for birth before 32 weeks and cervical length less than 25 mm is associated with 28% risk for birth before 28 weeks. The measurement of cervical length in pregnancies with symptoms of preterm labour may have limited accuracy in predicting preterm birth. In asymptomatic women, a positive fetal fibronectin test seems to be associated with 35% risk for birth before 32 weeks and 40% risk for birth less than 34 weeks, whereas a negative test decreases the risk to 6% and 17%, respectively. The differences in the predictive value of tests between twins and singletons reflect the diverse pathophysiology of preterm birth between the two groups.",

    "abstract": "Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are both disorders of the immune system; however, they are known as distinct diseases. Till now no clinical evidence suggests the genetic relationship between these two diseases. Herein, we present two identical twins; one was diagnosed as anti-GBM glomerulonephritis, the other SLE. This is the first clinical report on the genetic relationship between these two diseases.\nA 25-year-old female was admitted complaining of intermittent gross hematuria for 6 months and elevated serum creatinine for 1 month. She denied hemoptysis. Laboratory examinations showed hemoglobin 7.4 g/dL, serum creatinine 7.15 mg/dL and albumin 2.8 g/dL. Urinalysis showed hematuria (484 RBCs per high-power field) and proteinuria 4+. Antinuclear antibody, complement levels and ANCAs were all normal. Renal ultrasound showed normal-sized kidneys without obstruction or masses. Serum anti-GBM antibody assay showed 119.70 RU/mL (normal range, <20 RU/mL). Chest X-ray was normal. She was diagnosed as anti-GBM glomerulonephritis and received plasma exchange (2000-3000 ml plasma/exchange, 5 turns), methylprednisolone 0.5 g for three days, plus cyclophosphamide. Although serum anti-GBM antibodies decreased gradually to a normal range, her renal function did not improve. One month later, her identical twin sister was diagnosed as SLE based on malar erythema, arthralgia, antinuclear antibody positive with liter 1:1000, and Anti-Smith (Sm) antibody ++. Anti-GBM antibody and complements were within normal ranges. Further study showed these twins were HLA-DRB1*1501 homozygotes.\nThe presence of identical twins having anti-GBM nephritis and SLE respectively provides clinical evidence to support that anti-GBM nephritis and lupus may share a common genetic background to some extent, while environment may contribute to disease evolution in part.",

    "abstract": "Glycogen storage diseases are rare genetic disorders, mostly autosomal recessively inherited. Abnormal accumulation is because of the lack of one of the enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism. Neurological manifestation of the diseases involves muscle weakness and hypoglycemia-induced seizures. In this article, we present a history of twin sisters with unusual coincidence of glycogenosis type IIIb and epilepsy. Hypoglycemic background of seizures and organic changes of the central nervous system were excluded. Since the introduction of antiepileptic treatment, the patients have been seizure-free; however, paroxysmal electroencephalographic (EEG) changes have persisted. A high-protein and low-carbohydrate diet has protected them against hypoglycemia.",

    "abstract": "Submicroscopic deletion of 10p15.3 is a rare genetic disorder, currently reported in 21 unrelated patients. It is mainly associated with cognitive deficits, speech disorders, motor delay and hypotonia. The size of the deleted region ranges between 0.15 and 4 Mb and does not generally correlate with phenotype. A monozygotic female twin pair with a de novo 2.7 Mb deletion of 10p15.3 is herein reported. The girls presented at the age of 8 months with severe developmental delay and failure to thrive since the first month of life. Their perinatal and family history was unremarkable. On admission they both exhibited generalized dystonia, microcephaly, complete absence of voluntary movements and visual/auditory unresponsiveness. Their brain MRIs demonstrated dilatation of ventricles, subarachnoid spaces and anterior interhemispheric fissure and sylvian fissures bilaterally. Cranial radiography revealed partial fusion of both coronal sutures. Visual and brainstem auditory evoked potentials were markedly abnormal, indicating severe visual and sensorineural hearing impairment. The electroencephalogram, as well as a screening for inborn errors of metabolism, were unremarkable. Both patients required gastrostomy and tracheostomy before the age of 1 year. They were, additionally, managed with physical therapy, as well as baclofen and low-dose haloperidol. Their current state at the age of 2 years is relatively stable. The index patients' phenotype includes features, such as dystonic cerebral palsy, visual and sensorineural hearing impairment or craniosynostosis, which have not been previously reported in individuals with 10p15.3 deletion. It is necessary to consider these novel clinical features and investigate their possible relationship with the recently recognized syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Discordance for Turner syndrome in monozygotic (MZ) twins, which is known as heterokaryotypia, is very rare in MZ pregnancies. The combined effect of idiochromosome loss due to an anaphase lag and the relocation of discordant blastomeres may trigger the twinning procedure and discordance of Turner syndrome. We present 2 cases of MZ twins discordant for Turner syndrome that were diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound and cytogenetic studies (one fetus was 45,X and the other 46,XX). Both cases, which involved monochorionic (MC) diamniotic twins, underwent selective feticide and had favorable outcomes for the remaining twin. Ultrasound, amniocentesis of both sacs (dual amniocentesis) and zygosity determination are indispensable in diagnosing heterokaryotypia. Selective feticide is a treatment option in cases of heterokaryotypic MC diamniotic twins, and in our cases, it resulted in favorable outcomes for the remaining twin.",

    "abstract": "The majority of the congenital anomalies of middle ear are solitary and a non-hereditary. We report cases of identical twins with congenital incudo-stapedial disconnection. Case 1 was an 8-year-old girl. Hearing impairment was identified at the age of three. She was referred to our university hospital in April 2005. Pure-tone audiogram showed conductive hearing impairments. Computed tomography (CT) revealed the incudo-stapedial disconnections in both ears. The exploratory tympanotomies on the right and left ears were performed in May and July 2005, respectively. The surgical findings showed absence of the long process and presence of the lenticular process of the incus in both ears. After the reconstructions of ossicular chain, the hearing of both ears improved. Case 2 was an 11-year-old girl. The hearing impairment of the right ear was identified in May 2008. She was referred to our university hospital three months later. Pure-tone audiogram showed the conductive hearing impairment in the right ear. CT revealed the incudo-stapedial disconnection in the right ear. The surgery showed the same findings as those of case 1. Anomalies of both cases suggest that the lenticular process of the incus and the stapes originate from a common primordium.",

Four cases of conjoined twins underwent one-stage surgical separation under general anesthesia. Preoperative evaluation was performed to determine the extent of anatomical conjunction and associated anomalies. Anesthesia was simultaneously induced in all conjoined twins. The intubation procedure was successfully performed with the head slightly rotated to each baby's side, followed by the administration of vecuronium. Anesthetic agents were administered according to the estimated weight of each baby. One case of conjoined twins underwent surgical separation with cardiopulmonary bypass due to shared hearts. Results : All conjoined twins were successfully separated. No significant respiratory or cardiac events occurred during surgery except for one twin, which died after separation because of complicated congenital heart disease. Conclusions : Accurate preoperative evaluation, respiratory and circulatory management, and close cooperation of the multidisciplinary team are important aspects of anesthetic management of conjoined twins surgery.",

    "abstract": "Two sets of monozygotic (MZ) twins with Kawasaki disease (KD) from two different families are reported. Twin set 1, previously healthy 71-day-old MZ twin girls were diagnosed with incomplete KD and pneumonia. The symptoms occurred at the same time in both girls. Both girls had ectasia of right coronary arteries. In twin set 2, the younger of 18-month-old MZ twin boys was diagnosed with KD and bronchitis. After 53 days, his elder brother was diagnosed with the same disease. The symptoms occurred at different time, but were almost identical. Neither boy displayed coronary artery changes. These findings support the hypothesis that genes susceptible to KD and coronary-artery lesions may exist in families. The different clinical characteristics among MZ twins from different families also suggest diverse and complex nature of KD.",

    "abstract": "To compare cardiac function at 10 years of age in four groups of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pairs: uncomplicated MCDA twins (n\u2009=\u20096) (Group 1); twins that had had twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) managed by amnioreduction (TTTS-amnio, n\u2009=\u20099) (Group 2) or laser photocoagulation (TTTS-laser, n\u2009=\u200910) (Group 3); and dichorionic diamniotic controls (DCDA, n\u2009=\u20096) (Group 4).\nEchocardiograms optimizing apical four-chamber and short-axis left ventricular views were stored for offline speckle-tracking analysis, blinded to twin type. Myocardial long-axis shortening and lengthening velocities were measured using pulsed Doppler ultrasound at the cardiac base. M-mode measurements of fractional shortening (short axis) and maximal excursion of the atrioventricular annulus (four-chamber) were recorded. Syngo Vector Velocity Imaging software tracked left ventricular myocardial motion offline to produce free wall strain, strain rate and rotation. Intertwin pair and group differences were investigated using ANOVA.\nCardiac measurements were within the normal ranges for 10-year-olds. No significant within-twin-pair and intergroup differences were found in current size, heart rates, strain or strain rate. Compared to DCDA controls, TTTS twins showed less cardiac rotation (TTTS-laser, P\u2009<\u20090.001 and TTTS-amnio, P\u2009=\u20090.054) with significant intertwin reduction in the ex-recipient (TTTS-amnio, P\u2009=\u20090.006) and larger MCDA twins (P\u2009=\u20090.027) compared with their cotwins. A similar pattern was seen in left ventricular early diastolic mitral valve tissue velocity (MVE') in all monochorionic groups, but only achieving significance in TTTS-amnio twins (P\u2009=\u20090.037). Intrapair differences in rotation and MVE' were significantly different following treatment at Quintero stages III or IV.\nWithin-twin-pair patterns of left ventricular rotation and diastolic function differ at 10\u2009years of age in ex-recipients of TTTS twins treated with amnioreduction compared with those treated by laser photocoagulation and controls. .",

    "abstract": "Plastic bronchitis is an extremely rare disease characterized by the formation of tracheobronchial airway casts, which are composed of a fibrinous exudate with rubber-like consistency and cause respiratory distress as a result of severe airflow obstruction. Bronchial casts may be associated with congenital and acquired cardiopathies, bronchopulmonary diseases leading to mucus hypersecretion, and pulmonary lymphatic abnormalities. In recent years, however, there is growing evidence that plastic bronchitis can also be triggered by common respiratory tract infections and thereby cause atelectasis even in otherwise healthy children.\nWe report on 22-month-old monozygotic twins presenting with atelectasis triggered by a simple respiratory tract infection. The clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings given, bronchial cast formation was suspected in both infants but could only be confirmed after bronchoscopy in the first case. Real-time polymerase chain reaction of the removed cast as well as nasal lavage fluid of both infants demonstrated strong positivity for human bocavirus.\nOur case report is the first to describe two simultaneously affected monozygotic twins and substantiates the hypothesis of a contributing genetic factor in the pathophysiology of this disease. In this second report related to human bocavirus, we show additional evidence that this condition can be triggered by a simple respiratory tract infection in previously healthy infants.",

    "abstract": "Twin registries around the globe have collected DNA samples from large numbers of monozygotic and dizygotic twins. The twin sample collections are frequently used as controls in disease-specific studies together with non-twins. This approach is unbiased under the hypothesis that twins and singletons are comparable in terms of allele frequencies; i.e. there are no genetic variants associated with being a twin per se. To test this hypothesis we performed a genome-wide association study comparing the allele frequency of 572,352 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,413 monozygotic (MZ) and 5,451 dizygotic (DZ) twins with 3,720 healthy singletons. Twins and singletons have been genotyped using the same platform. SNPs showing association with being a twin at P-value < 1 \u00d7 10(-5) were selected for replication analysis in 1,492 twins (463 MZ and 1,029 DZ) and 1,880 singletons from Finland. No SNPs reached genome-wide significance (P-value < 5 \u00d7 10(-8)) in the main analysis combining MZ and DZ twins. In a secondary analysis including only DZ twins two SNPs (rs2033541 close to ADAMTSL1 and rs4149283 close to ABCA1)\u00a0were genome-wide significant after meta-analysis with the Finnish population. The estimated proportion of variance on the liability scale explained by all SNPs was 0.08 (P-value=0.003) when MZ and DZ were considered together and smaller for MZ (0.06, P-value=0.10) compared to DZ (0.09, P-value=0.003) when analyzed separately. In conclusion, twins and singletons can be used in genetic studies together with general population samples without introducing large bias. Further research is needed to explore genetic variances associated with DZ twinning.",

    "abstract": "The impact of nuchal translucency (NT) screening in twins conceived after use of assisted reproduction technology (ART) has not been addressed properly in the literature. The aim of the current study was to assess, in a large cohort from a single center, NT in twins following various modes of ART as compared with NT in spontaneously-conceived twins and to differentiate results with regard to chorionicity.\nRetrospective data from 825 twin pregnancies were available for this study. All pregnant women underwent NT screening and chorionicity determination between 11\u2009+\u20090 and 13\u2009+\u20096 weeks' gestation in our center. Information about mode of conception and pregnancy outcome was obtained from hospital records and by telephone interviews. Twins were classified as having been conceived after in-vitro fertilization (IVF) with the woman's own or a donated embryo, after non-IVF ART or spontaneously. NT distribution in subgroups of fetuses was compared on the basis of the multiple of the normal median (MoM), SD of log10 MoM estimated by the 90(th) -10(th) centile range divided by 2.563 and the proportion of NT values exceeding the normal 95(th) centile which was 1.641 MoM in the singletons.\nNT values were statistically significantly higher in ART pregnancies as compared with spontaneously-conceived pregnancies (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P\u2009<\u20090.05) with medians of 1.073 and 1.038 MoM, respectively, but the proportion with values above the normal 95(th) percentile did not differ (chi-square test, P\u2009=\u20090.89). Among the ART twins, NT values were significantly higher for those conceived using IVF methods (P\u2009<\u20090.005), with a median of 1.082 MoM, compared with a median of 1.022 MoM using other methods. However, although a greater proportion exceeded the 95(th) centile (7.3% compared with 4.8%) this difference did not reach statistical significance (P\u2009=\u20090.17). There were no differences in NT values according to chorionicity (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P\u2009= 0.75). The standard deviation of log10 NT was similar for all subgroups of twins. The correlation coefficient between fetuses in ART pregnancies was statistically significantly lower than that in spontaneously-conceived pregnancies (P\u2009<\u20090.05) but no significant differences were found between types of ART or according to chorionicity.\nThere was a small but significant increase in NT levels among ART pregnancies, which appeared to be confined to those conceived using IVF, and a small reduction in the correlation between fetuses. These effects probably have little impact on the estimated risk based on algorithms in use today.",

    "abstract": "A twin pair affected by juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) with the same somatic PTPN11 mutation and abnormal chromosome 7 in bone marrow samples but distinct prognostic gene expression signatures, received a matched-unrelated donor and matched-unrelated cord blood transplant, respectively. Both twins fully engrafted, but after 6\u00a0months, the twin with an acute-myeloid-like (AML-like) signature at diagnosis rejected the graft and had an autologous reconstitution. A second transplant with an unrelated 5/6-HLA-matched-loci cord blood performed after 4\u00a0months from rejection was unsuccessful. After 25\u00a0months from diagnosis, the twin with the AML-like gene expression signature died of liver failure while on progression of his JMML. The other twin, who had a non-acute-myeloid-like (non-AML-like) gene expression signature at diagnosis is in complete hematological remission with full donor chimera. This observation suggests a biological diversity of JMML also in patients with a common genetic background.",

Prevalence is less than 1%, but despite that it has a major influence on an individual and community. There is an increased risk for schizophrenia and mood diorders in first degree relatives with SAD, according to DSM IV. This paper describes the concordant clinical response of a pair of monozygotic twins with SAD when treated with risperidon and valproic acid. We found that their clinical symptoms were very similar and both brothers expressed hipomanic and depressive episode prior to full onset of SAD-psychotic symptoms with correlations of elevated mood, and first psychiatric hospitalization at the age of 19 (patient A) and 18 (patient B). Their response to the combined treatment with risperidon and valproic acid has been also similar both in intensity and in the pattern of symptoms that have improved.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the relationship between twin language, twins' close ties, and social competence in a prospective longitudinal study. We hypothesized that twins whose tie is close would be more likely to develop a twin language, and these twins would be less likely to develop social competence. In addition, we hypothesize that some environmental factors, such as having an older sibling, preschool attendance, zygosity, and sex are also related to twin language, twins' close ties, and social competence. At baseline in 1999 a mailed questionnaire survey was conducted, and a follow-up questionnaire was distributed in 2004 among 958 mothers. As a result, 516 respondents returned the questionnaire (53.9%). In this study, we used 261 twin pairs aged from 6 to 12 years (school-age children) for analysis, excluding those with missing values. In the present study, we found that zygosity and sex were associated with twins' close ties. Having an older sibling and preschool attendance did not affect the twins' close tie, twin language, or social competence. One of the most important findings was that social competence was not affected directly by twins' close tie, but was affected when a twin language was found.",

    "abstract": "We investigated genetic influence on sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) composition by a classical twin study of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins in the first 3 months of life. Polysomnographic (PSG) recordings were obtained in 10 MZ and 20 DZ twin pairs in the 37th, 46th, and 52nd week of postmenstrual age (PMA). The EEG power spectra were generated on the basis of fast Fourier transformation (FFT). Genetic influence on active sleep/rapid eye movement (AS/REM)] and quiet sleep/non rapid eye movement (QS/NREM) sleep composition was estimated by calculating within pair concordance and the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for delta (0.5-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz), alpha (8-11.5 Hz), sigma (12-14 Hz), and beta (14.5-20 Hz) at central derivation. MZ twins show higher ICCs than DZ twins for alpha, sigma, and beta spectral powers during QS/NREM sleep in the 37th, 46th, and 52nd week PMA. However, there was no significant difference (P > .05) between the 2 types of twins in absolute differences of EEG spectral power of the alpha, beta, and sigma frequency ranges in the 37th, 46th, and 52nd week PMA. The greatest mean absolute difference within MZ and DZ twin pairs and also between MZ and DZ twin groups was identified in the delta frequency range. Our findings gave an indication of genetic influence on alpha, sigma, and beta frequency ranges in the QS/NREM sleep stage.",

    "abstract": "To assess the outcome of monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twins with the aid of the MD-twin score.\nWe enrolled 112 MD-twin women in a tertiary perinatal center from 1997 to 2009. The MD-twin score was prospectively applied once per week to women who did not have twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) after 26 weeks of gestation. The MD-twin score consists of five variables: (i) fetal weight discordance; (ii) amniotic fluid discordance; (iii) hydrops fetalis; (iv) umbilical cord insertion; and (v) fetal heart rate monitoring. Normal was assigned a value of 0, abnormal was assigned 1, and total score was used for evaluation. Women with scores of 2 at 26 weeks gestation were managed expectantly until the score reached 3. Outcome measures were fetal death, neonatal death and neurological sequelae. The incidence of poor outcome according to score was investigated. The characteristics of MD twins with poor outcome were investigated.\nMD-twin scores were applied to 90 women. Among them, 79 had scores of 2 or less and all had good outcomes. There were 11 women with a score of 3, four of whom had adverse outcome for at least one twin. Neonates born to women with scores of 0-2 had good outcomes without respect to birthweight percentile, while neonates with scores of 3 had poor outcomes when their birthweight percentile was less than the third percentile.\nThe MD-twin score is applicable to 90% of MD twins without TTTS. An MD-twin score of 2 is reassuring, while a score of 3 indicates increased risks for adverse outcome.",

    "abstract": "To assess the relationship of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with health functioning and disability in Vietnam-era Veterans.\nA cross-sectional study of functioning and disability in male Vietnam-era Veteran twins. PTSD was measured by the\u00a0Composite International Diagnostic Interview; health functioning and disability were assessed using the Veterans RAND 36-Item Health Survey (VR-36) and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0). All data collection took place between 2010 and 2012.\nAverage age of the 5,574 participating Veterans (2,102 Vietnam theater and 3,472 non-theater) was 61.0\u00a0years. Veterans with PTSD had poorer health functioning across all domains of VR-36 and increased disability for all subscales of WHODAS 2.0 (all p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) compared with Veterans without PTSD. Veterans with PTSD were in poorer overall health on the VR-36 physical composite summary (PCS) (effect size\u00a0=\u00a00.31 in theater and 0.47 in non-theater Veterans; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001 for both) and mental composite summary (MCS) (effect size\u00a0=\u00a00.99 in theater and 0.78 in non-theater Veterans; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001 for both) and had increased disability on the WHODAS 2.0 summary score (effect size\u00a0=\u00a01.02 in theater and 0.96 in non-theater Veterans; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001 for both). Combat exposure, independent of PTSD status, was associated with lower PCS and MCS scores and increased disability (all p\u00a0<\u00a0.05, for trend). Within-pair analyses in twins discordant for PTSD produced consistent findings.\nVietnam-era Veterans with PTSD have diminished functioning and increased disability. The poor functional status of aging combat-exposed Veterans is of particular concern.",

    "abstract": "Angelman syndrome (AS, OMIM105830) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by different genetic mechanisms. Determining the genetic mechanism is essential to establish the recurrence risk and the accuracy of genetic/reproductive counseling. The majority of AS patients present with a deletion of the 15q11.2-q13 region on the maternally derived chromosome. The other genetic mechanisms are: paternal disomy of chromosome 15, imprinting center defects, and mutations in the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A gene (UBE3A). Different recurrence risks are associated with each specific genetic mechanism involved. We report on the study of dizygotic twins with classic phenotypic AS due to deletion of the same maternally derived chromosome 15. The mother presented with hypopigmented macular lesions on the inner side of both arms. Fibroblast culture studies of the maternal hypopigmented skin areas from both arms showed mosaicism for a normal cell line and for a second cell line with a 15q11.2-q13 deletion. This family represents the first demonstrated case of maternal somatic and germ line mosaicism for 15q11.2-q13 deletion as the cause of AS.",

The reported outcome was cortisol from saliva samples from 89 twins (n=49 co-bedding, n=40 standard care) collected immediately before the heel lance (baseline levels) and 113 twins (n=58 co-bedding, n=55 standard care) collected 20 minutes after heel lance (stress levels) as an index of stress response.\nNo group differences were noted in baseline salivary cortisol levels: 0.36 \u03bcg/dL (SD 0.25) in the co-bedding group and 0.43 \u03bcg/dL (SD 0.50) in the standard care group. Twenty minutes after lance, levels were significantly lower in the co-bedding group, 0.28 \u03bcg/dL (SD 0.25) versus 0.50 \u03bcg/dL (SD 0.73) in the standard group (P=0.04). Similarly, the mean of paired changes in salivary cortisol from baseline was lower in the co-bedding group (-0.06 \u03bcg/dL) compared with the standard care group (0.14 \u03bcg/dL, P<0.05).\nCo-bedding attenuates the stress response of preterm twins undergoing heel lance.\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT009176.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this case report was to describe oral findings and outline challenges and considerations for general anesthetic (GA) and dental management of 4-year-old female craniopagus (cranially conjoined) twins, at high risk for medical comorbidity, who presented for treatment of severe early childhood caries. This hospital-based procedure required good interdisciplinary communication, cooperation, and presurgical planning to address unique challenges and ensure positive postoperative outcomes. Two separate anesthesia teams delivered GA simultaneously to each twin. To minimize anesthetic exposure, two pediatric dental teams completed dental care concurrently. Extensive plaque accumulation and unusual \"mirror-image\" caries distribution were attributed to frequency and postural pooling during feeding. The rehabilitation objective was to provide definitive dental management, minimizing future need for dental retreatment under GA. Two-month follow-up revealed intact dental restorations, good oral hygiene, and weight gain. For these unique twins however, the challenge of long-term oral health maintenance remains.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the role of genetic and environmental factors in the development of anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and ACPA-positive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a twin cohort.\nA total of 12\u2005590 twins were analysed for the presence of ACPAs (CCP2 ELISA), HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) gene alleles, and exposure to smoking. Twins with established RA were identified in national public care registers. Antibody reactivities against citrullinated and native forms of \u03b1-enolase, vimentin, fibrinogen and type II collagen peptides were tested by ELISA in anti-CCP2-positive subjects and their cotwins. Structural equation models and ORs for the development of ACPA and ACPA-positive RA were computed for smokers and SE carriers.\nA total of 2.8% (350/12\u2005590) of the twins were ACPA positive, and 1.0% (124/12\u2005590) had ACPA-positive RA. Most of the variability in the ACPA status was accounted for by non-shared environmental or stochastic factors (78%, 95% CI 55% to 100%) rather than shared environmental and genetic factors. Analysis of specific risk factors revealed an association between smoking and SE and the presence of ACPAs. Twins with ACPA-positive RA were more frequently SE positive than twins with ACPAs without RA. Reactivities against multiple citrullinated peptides were present in most twins with ACPA-positive RA but in fewer twins with ACPAs without RA.\nEnvironment, lifestyle and stochastic factors may be more important than genetics in determining which individuals develop ACPAs. Genetic factors (particularly SE) may have a relatively larger role in determining which ACPA-positive individuals will ultimately develop arthritis.",

    "abstract": "Although many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) experience difficulties with anxiety,the manifestation of these difficulties remains unresolved. The current study assessed anxiety in a large population based twin sample, aged 10\u201315 years. Phenotypic analyses were used to explore anxiety symptoms in children with ASDs, their unaffected co-twins and a control sample.\nParticipants included 146 families from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) where one or both children had a suspected ASD. Eighty control families were also included. The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression scale (Chorpita, Yim, Moffitt, Umemoto & Francis, 2000) was completed (self- and parent-report), along with diagnostic and cognitive tests. Children were categorized into four groups (a) ASD (b) Broader Autism Phenotype (BAP: mainly co-twins of children with ASDs, with high subclinical autistic traits) (c) unaffected co-twins (with neither ASDs nor BAP) (d) controls.\nChildren in the ASD and BAP groups scored significantly higher than controls for all parent-rated (although not child-rated) anxiety subscales.There were no significant differences between the ASD and BAP groups for any of the parent-rated anxiety subscales. Compared with controls, unaffected co-twins showed significantly heightened Social Anxiety, Generalized Anxiety,and Panic symptoms. Significant associations were observed between certain anxiety subscales and both IQ and ASD symptoms. For example, greater parent-rated Social Anxiety was associated with higher IQ and increased social and communicative impairments. Significant interrater correlations were observed for anxiety reports in children with ASDs (r = .27\u2013.54; p < .01), their unaffected co-twins (r = .32\u2013.63; p < .01) and controls (r = .23\u2013.43; p < .01)suggesting that children in this sample with and without ASD symptoms were able to report on their anxiety symptoms with some accuracy.\nThese findings support previous reports of heightened anxiety in children with ASDs, at least on parent-reported measures. Unaffected co-twins of children with ASDs also showed increased anxiety, generating questions about the potential etiological overlap between ASDs and anxiety. Progress in this area now depends on more refined anxiety measurement in ASDs and continued investigation of interrater differences.",

By examining monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for caregiving, we assessed the extent to which distress is directly related to caregiving or confounded by common genes and environmental exposures.\nCaregiving was associated with distress as measured by mental health functioning, anxiety, perceived stress, and depression. The overall association between caregiving and distress was confounded by common genes and environment for mental health functioning, anxiety, and depression. Common environment also confounded the association of caregiving and perceived stress.\nVulnerability to distress is a factor in predicting caregivers' psychosocial functioning.

    "abstract": "In colorectal cancer, increased expression of the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been shown to provoke metastatic disease due to the interaction with its ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). Recently, a second SDF-1 receptor, CXCR7, was found to enhance tumor growth in solid tumors. Albeit signaling cascades via SDF-1/CXCR4 have been intensively studied, the significance of the SDF-1/CXCR7-induced intracellular communication triggering malignancy is still only marginally understood.\nIn tumor tissue of 52 patients with colorectal cancer, we observed that expression of CXCR7 and CXCR4 increased with tumor stage and tumor size. Asking whether activation of CXCR4 or CXCR7 might result in a similar expression pattern, we performed microarray expression analyses using lentivirally CXCR4- and/or CXCR7-overexpressing SW480 colon cancer cell lines with and without stimulation by SDF-1\u03b1.\nGene regulation via SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR4 and SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR7 was completely different and partly antidromic. Differentially regulated genes were assigned by gene ontology to migration, proliferation, and lipid metabolic processes. Expressions of AKR1C3, AXL, C5, IGFBP7, IL24, RRAS, and TNNC1 were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Using the in silico gene set enrichment analysis, we showed that expressions of miR-217 and miR-218 were increased in CXCR4 and reduced in CXCR7 cells after stimulation with SDF-1\u03b1. Functionally, exposure to SDF-1\u03b1 increased invasiveness of CXCR4 and CXCR7 cells, AXL knockdown hampered invasion. Compared with controls, CXCR4 cells showed increased sensitivity against 5-FU, whereas CXCR7 cells were more chemoresistant.\nThese opposing results for CXCR4- or CXCR7-overexpressing colon carcinoma cells demand an unexpected attention in the clinical application of chemokine receptor antagonists such as plerixafor.",

Differentially regulated genes were assigned by gene ontology to migration, proliferation, and lipid metabolic processes. Expressions of AKR1C3, AXL, C5, IGFBP7, IL24, RRAS, and TNNC1 were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Using the in silico gene set enrichment analysis, we showed that expressions of miR-217 and miR-218 were increased in CXCR4 and reduced in CXCR7 cells after stimulation with SDF-1\u03b1. Functionally, exposure to SDF-1\u03b1 increased invasiveness of CXCR4 and CXCR7 cells, AXL knockdown hampered invasion. Compared with controls, CXCR4 cells showed increased sensitivity against 5-FU, whereas CXCR7 cells were more chemoresistant.",

The advent of specific laboratory tests has refined the identification of genetic traits. In this case report, we describe the occurrence of pulmonary embolism in young twins. Intensive tumour screening remained unremarkable. Evaluation of established risk factors for a clotting disorder remained negative, with the exception of a plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 4G/5G polymorphism. Despite the mild association accompanied by the presence of the 4G allele, this polymorphism might predispose to venous thromboembolism in some cases in general and in our case in particular.",

    "abstract": "The relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to brain structure change throughout the lifespan. Brain structures have been reported to be highly heritable in middle-aged individuals and younger; however, the influence of genes on brain structure is less studied in older adults. We performed a magnetic resonance imaging study of 236 older twins, with a mean age of 71.4 \u00b1 5.7 years, to examine the heritability of 53 brain global and lobar volumetric measures. Total brain volume (63%) and other volumetric measures were moderately to highly heritable in late life, and these genetic influences tended to decrease with age, suggesting a greater influence of environmental factors as age advanced. Genetic influences were higher in men and on the left hemisphere compared with the right. In multivariate models, common genetic factors were observed for global and lobar total and gray matter volumes. This study examined the genetic contribution to 53 brain global and lobar volumetric measures in older twins for the first time, and the influence of age, sex, and laterality on these genetic contributions, which are useful information for a better understanding of the process of brain aging and helping individuals to have a healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Most, but not all, studies report a positive association between birth weight, as an indirect marker of prenatal hormone exposure, and offspring breast cancer risk, particularly premenopausal breast cancer. Females from opposite-sexed twin pairs may also be prenatally exposed to androgens from their twin brothers. A Swedish study of opposite-sexed twins with a small sample size found a very strong positive association between female birth weight and breast cancer risk. In this case-control study, nested within a cohort of female opposite-sexed twins, we included 543 breast cancer case subjects diagnosed in the period from 1972 to 2008 and 2715 matched control subjects. Conditional logistic regression estimated the breast cancer risk associated with birth weight and other birth characteristics, including gestational age and co-twin birth weight. All statistical tests were two-sided. There was no association between birth weight (odds ratio = 1.01; 95% confidence interval = 0.70 to 1.46) or twin brother's birth weight and risk of breast cancer, which suggests the previously reported strong positive association may have been a chance finding.",

The objective was to compare prescription fillings within twin pairs who are partly or fully genetically identical and share childhood exposures.\nTwin cohort study.\nDenmark.\nData from the Danish Twin Registry were linked to registers in Statistics Denmark and the Danish Registry of Medicinal Product statistics. A total of 8582 monozygotic (MZ) and 15 788 dizygotic same sex (DZSS) twins were included.\nNumber of prescription fillings during follow-up (1995-2005) was analysed according to education and income. Results of unpaired and intrapair analyses were compared.\nAn inverse social gradient in filling of prescriptions for all-purpose and system-specific drugs was observed in the unpaired analyses. In the intrapair analyses, associations were attenuated some in DZSS and more in MZ twins. Filling of drugs targeting the nervous system was still strongly associated with income in the intrapair analyses.\nFamilial factors seem to account for part of the observed social inequality in filling of prescription medicine.",

Mutations of the solute carrier family 26 member 3 gene cause profuse, chloride ion rich diarrhea, which results in hypochloremia, hyponatremia and metabolic alkalosis with dehydration. If a fetal ultrasound shows bowel dilatation suggestive of bowel obstruction, or if a neonate shows persistent diarrhea and metabolic alkalosis, CLD should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The severity of CLD varies, but early detection and early therapy can prevent complications including growth failure. We report a case of dizygotic twins affected by CLD who had been born to non-consanguineous parents. Both of them showed growth failure, but one of the twins experienced worse clinical course. He showed developmental delay, along with dehydration and severe electrolyte imbalance. He was diagnosed with CLD first at 6-month age, and then the other one was also diagnosed with CLD.",

The objective of the study was to investigate sex-related differences in perinatal complications.\nA cohort of 16,045 twin pregnancies - 32,090 twins - was explored for obstetric complications, perinatal and infant mortality, and neonatal morbidities.\nTwin pregnancies with a female fetus had an increased risk for preeclampsia, but otherwise there were no pregnancy complications associated with fetal sex. After birth, female-female twins had lower early neonatal and infant mortality, and lower risk for respiratory morbidities than male-male twins at all gestational ages. In unlike-sexed twin pairs, very preterm males had higher respiratory morbidity than females and, females were at higher risk for being growth restricted.\nMale-male twins have higher respiratory morbidity and neonatal mortality than female-female twins. In unliked-sexed twin pairs, the males seem to be protected by having a female co-twin.",

    "abstract": "Male sex is a risk factor for pre-term birth (PTB) among singleton pregnancies; however, in twin pregnancies, the effect of sex on PTB is not yet clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of twin's sex on risk of PTB. During this analytical cross-sectional study, we evaluated the effect of twin's sex, chorionicity and other factors on risk of PTB in 676 pregnant women in a university hospital in Tehran, Iran. Existence of male gender in pregnancy was a risk factor for PTB. Comparing same sex twins together, male-male gender was a risk factor for PTB (OR = 1.67 (1.19-2.34), p = 0.002), early PTB (OR = 1.18 (1.04-1.34), p = 0.01) and very early PTB (OR = 1.06 (1-1.13), p = 0.04). Monoamnion twins were at higher risk for early PTB (OR = 1.44 (1.08-1.92), p = 0.02), and very early PTB (OR = 1.95 (1.1-3.44), p = 0.03) but the risk did not increase in monochorion twins. History of abortion was also shown to be a risk factor (p < 0.05). Maternal age, multiparity, body mass index (BMI) and assisted reproductive techniques (ART) did not reach the significance levels to be considered as risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Multiple forms of drug abuse/dependence frequently co-occur with problem/pathological gambling (PPG). The current study examines the extent to which genetic and environmental factors contribute to their co-occurrence.\nBivariate models investigated the magnitude and correlation of genetic and environmental contributions to problem/pathological gambling and its co-occurrence with nicotine dependence, cannabis abuse/dependence and stimulant abuse/dependence.\nComputer-assisted telephone interviews in the community.\nParticipants were 7869 male twins in the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, a USA-based national twin registry.\nLife-time DSM-III-R diagnoses for problem/pathological gambling, nicotine dependence, cannabis abuse/dependence and stimulant abuse/dependence were determined using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule.\nAll drug-use disorders displayed additive genetic and non-shared environmental contributions, with cannabis abuse/dependence also displaying shared environmental contributions. Both genetic [genetic correlation rA \u2009=\u20090.22; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20090.10-0.34] and non-shared environmental components (environmental correlation rE \u2009=\u20090.24; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.10-0.37) contributed to the co-occurrence of problem/pathological gambling and nicotine dependence. This pattern was shared by cannabis abuse/dependence (rA \u2009=\u20090.32; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.05-1.0; rE \u2009=\u20090.36; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.16-0.55) but not stimulant abuse/dependence (SAD), which showed only genetic contributions to the co-occurrence with problem/pathological gambling (rA \u2009=\u20090.58; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.45-0.73).\nStrong links between gambling and stimulant-use disorders may relate to the neurochemical properties of stimulants or the illicit nature of using 'hard' drugs such as cocaine. The greater contribution of environmental factors to the co-occurrence between problem/pathological gambling and 'softer' forms of drug abuse/dependence (cannabis, tobacco) suggest that environmental interventions (perhaps relating to availability and legality) may help to diminish the relationship between problem/pathological gambling and tobacco- and cannabis-use disorders.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) shows \u223c40% concordance rate in monozygotic twins (MZ) suggesting a role for environmental factors and/or epigenetic modifications in the etiology of the disease. The aim of our study was to dissect the contribution of epigenetic factors, particularly, DNA methylation (DNAm), to the incomplete penetrance of T1D. We performed DNAm profiling in lymphocyte cell lines from 3 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for T1D and 6 MZ twin pairs concordant for the disease using HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. This assay assesses the methylation state of 27,578 CpG sites, mostly located within proximal promoter regions. We identified 88 CpG sites displaying significant methylation changes in all T1D-discordant MZ twin pairs. Functional annotation of the genes with distinct CpG methylation profiles in T1D samples showed differential DNAm of immune response and defense response pathways between affected and unaffected twins. Integration of DNAm data with GWAS data mapped several known T1D associated genes, HLA, INS, IL-2RB, CD226, which showed significant differences in DNAm between affected and unaffected of twins. Our findings suggest that abnormalities of DNA methylation patterns, known to regulate gene transcription, may be involved in the pathogenesis of T1D.",

A secondary aim was to evaluate the role of familial confounding in these associations.\nA sample of 31,206 Swedish twin individuals was followed from 1998-2003 to the end of 2008 via national registries for DP supplemented with additional baseline questionnaire data. Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated.\nThe single effect of moderate to heavy alcohol consumption was associated with decreased risk of DP irrespective of diagnosis group in analyses accounting for background and familial factors (HR 0.42-0.88). Low frequency of physical activity (HR 1.17-1.63) or being past or regular user of tobacco products (HR 1.38-3.49) predicted increased risk for DP in all diagnosis groups. Interactions between physical activity and alcohol or tobacco consumption were significant for DP due to musculoskeletal diagnoses and mental diagnoses.\nHealth behaviours are important risk factors for DP irrespective of diagnosis groups. The effect of health behaviours is independent from familial effects (genetics and shared environment) pointing to a direct effect of health behaviours on DP, but education, body mass index, number and severity of diseases and marital status may confound the associations. The complex interrelationships between the health behaviours revealed by interactions suggest that prevention of future DP should attempt to influence these co-existent behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation play a key role in gene regulation and disease susceptibility. However, little is known about the genome-wide frequency, localization, and function of methylation variation and how it is regulated by genetic and environmental factors. We utilized the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource (MuTHER) and generated Illumina 450K adipose methylome data from 648 twins. We found that individual CpGs had low variance and that variability was suppressed in promoters. We noted that DNA methylation variation was highly heritable (h(2)median = 0.34) and that shared environmental effects correlated with metabolic phenotype-associated CpGs. Analysis of methylation quantitative-trait loci (metQTL) revealed that 28% of CpGs were associated with nearby SNPs, and when overlapping them with adipose expression quantitative-trait loci (eQTL) from the same individuals, we found that 6% of the loci played a role in regulating both gene expression and DNA methylation. These associations were bidirectional, but there were pronounced negative associations for promoter CpGs. Integration of metQTL with adipose reference epigenomes and disease associations revealed significant enrichment of metQTL overlapping metabolic-trait or disease loci in enhancers (the strongest effects were for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and body mass index [BMI]). We followed up with the BMI SNP rs713586, a cg01884057 metQTL that overlaps an enhancer upstream of ADCY3, and used bisulphite sequencing to refine this region. Our results showed widespread population invariability yet sequence dependence on adipose DNA methylation but that incorporating maps of regulatory elements aid in linking CpG variation to gene regulation and disease risk in a tissue-dependent manner.",

A heavy neurological disease burden is imparted by fumarase deficiency, commonly manifesting as microcephaly, dystonia, global developmental delay, seizures, and lethality in the infantile period. Heterozygous carriers also carry an increased risk of developing hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma. We describe a non-consanguineous family in whom a dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy resulted in twin boys with fumarase deficiency proven at the biochemical, enzymatic, and molecular levels. Their clinical phenotype included hepatic involvement. A novel mutation in the fumarate hydratase gene was identified in this family.",

Physiological parameters are assumed to be very similar in MZ twin pairs in contrast to DZ twin pairs or unrelated speakers, and it is hypothesized that the speaker specific shape of articulatory looping trajectories of the tongue is at least partly dependent on biomechanical properties and the speaker's individual physiology. By means of electromagnetic articulography (EMA), inter-speaker variability in the looping trajectories of the tongue back during /VCV/ sequences is analyzed. Results reveal similar looping patterns within MZ twin pairs but in DZ pairs differences in the shape of the loop, the direction of the upward and downward movement, and the amount of horizontal sliding movement at the palate are found.",

    "abstract": "To examine the role of genetic and environmental factors on sleep behavior in 12-year-old twins matched for family environment.\nPopulation-based twin cohort.\nParticipants were assessed in their home environment.\nOne hundred thirty-two adolescent twins comprising 25 monozygotic (MZ) and 41 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs; aged 12.2 \u00b1 0.1 y (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).\nN/A.\nFor 2 weeks in their home environment, participants wore a wrist activity monitor and completed a daily sleep diary. Sleep diaries included reports of bedtime, wake time, and estimated sleep onset time. Mean timing, duration, and quality of sleep during the 2 weeks were calculated for each individual and compared within twin pairs. MZ twin correlations were higher than the DZ correlations for total sleep time (MZr = 0.64; DZr = 0.38) and sleep onset latency (MZr = 0.83; DZr = 0.53) and significantly higher for wake after sleep onset (MZr = 0.66; DZr = 0.04) and sleep efficiency (MZr = 0.82; DZr = 0.10). Univariate modeling showed additive genetic factors accounted for 65% of the variance in total sleep time, 83% in sleep onset latency, and 52% and 57% of the variance in wake after sleep onset and sleep efficiency, respectively. A predominant influence of shared environment was found on the timing of sleep (67% for sleep start time, 86% for sleep end time).\nThere is a strong genetic influence on the sleep-wake patterns of 12-year-old adolescents. Genes have a greater influence on sleep initiation and sleep maintenance and a smaller role in sleep timing, likely to be influenced by family environment.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this review is to assess the evidence that supports the use of ultrasound in twin pregnancies. Although many of the indications for obstetric ultrasound are the same in both singleton and multiple gestations, there are special considerations as well as unique conditions in twins that require additional imaging studies. The reasons for ultrasound in twins include pregnancy dating, determination of chorionicity, nuchal translucency assessment, anatomical survey, placental evaluation, cervical length assessment, routine fetal growth, and serial surveillance of pregnancies complicated by anomalies, cervical shortening, fetal growth disturbances, and amniotic fluid abnormalities. Twins with monochorionic placentation require heightened scrutiny for monoamnionicity, conjoined twins, twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) syndrome, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, unequal placental sharing with discordant twin growth or selective intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR), twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS), and single fetal demise. Ultrasound is essential for the detection and management of conditions that can complicate dichorionic and monochorionic twin pregnancies.",

Multilevel modeling estimated means and variances of vocabulary and grammar phenotypes, controlling for familiality. Heritability was estimated with DeFries-Fulker regression and variance components models to determine effects of heritability, shared environment, and nonshared environment.\nTwins had lower average language scores than norms for single-born children, with lower average performance for monozygotic than dizygotic twins and for boys than girls, although gender and zygosity did not interact. Gender did not predict LLE. Significant heritability was detected for vocabulary (0.26) and grammar phenotypes (0.52 and 0.43 for boys and girls, respectively) in the full sample and in the sample selected for LLE (0.42 and 0.44). LLE and the appearance of Word Combinations were also significantly heritable (0.22-0.23).\nThe findings revealed an increased likelihood of LLE in twin toddlers compared with single-born children that is modulated by zygosity and gender differences. Heritability estimates are consistent with previous research for vocabulary and add further suggestion of heritable differences in early grammar acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Chronological age, dental development, height and weight measurements, sexual maturation characteristics and skeletal age are some biological indicators that have been used to identify time of growth. Many researchers have agreed that skeletal maturity is closely related to the craniofacial growth, and bones of hand and wrist are reliable parameters in assessing it. The complete hand and wrist radiograph involves 30 bones and assessment of these bones is one elaborate task. The present study is therefore, undertaken to assess the correlation between the chronological age, dental age and skeletal ages among different types of twins.\nThe study consisted of 60 subjects (30 twins) aged 8 to 16 years, divided into group of 10 monozygotic, 10 dizygotic and 10 mixed sex twins. The sample was selected from Twin Survey- 2008 conducted by Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics, Sree Balaji Dental College and Hospital, Chennai. Their zygosity was determined by sex, blood groups and by the parent. The chronological age was measured by the date of birth given by the parents. Panoramic and hand wrist x-rays were taken. Dental age was assessed by Demerjian et al method and skeletal age by Greulich and Pyle method. The correlation among twins in dental and skeletal ages with the chronological age was assessed using Correlation Coefficient and Student's't' Test.\nThe obtained data was fed into the computer and statistical analysis was done for the same using the SPSS version 10.0. Statistical significance was tested at P<0.05 level. Mean and Standard Deviation, Correlation Coefficient, Student's't' Test statistical methods were employed. The result showed highly significant 'p' value as <0.001 in all the correlations except for mixed pairs. Descriptive statistics in most of the areas demonstrated a non-significant result between zygosity groups.\nThere is a correlation existing between the individual's chronological age, dental age and skeletal age and correlation also exists in the twin pairs of the same zygosity and among each pair but no correlation exists between different zygotic twins.

    "abstract": "To investigate whether stability or changes in smoking predict disability pension (DP) due to low back diagnoses (LBD) and musculoskeletal diagnoses (MSD) after taking familial confounding into account using a co-twin design.\nLongitudinal smoking patterns and multiple covariates in a population-based cohort of 17,451 Finnish twins (6959 complete pairs) born before 1958 were surveyed through questionnaires in 1975 and 1981. The outcome data were collected from the national pension registers until the end of 2004. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for statistical analyses.\nDisability pension due to low back diagnoses was granted to 408 individuals and disability pension due to musculoskeletal diagnoses to 1177 individuals during the follow-up of 23 years. Being a persistent smoker (current smoker both 1975 and 1981) predicted a significantly increased risk for disability pension (hazard ratio 1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.46, 1.97) compared to those individuals who had never smoked. The association remained when several confounding factors, including familial factors, were taken into account.\nPersistent smoking predicts early disability pension due to musculoskeletal diagnoses and low back diagnoses independently from numerous confounding factors, including familial effects shared by the co-twins.",

    "abstract": "To compare the axial length elongation and change in refractive errors in a pair of identical twins wearing orthokeratology (ortho-k) and single vision lenses (SVLs), respectively.\nIdentical Twin A and B, who were 8 years of age, with the same amount of near activities, were assigned to wear ortho-k and SVLs randomly and they were monitored for two years for myopic progression. Twin A and B were assigned to wear ortho-k and SVLs, respectively. Myopic progression was evaluated by the change in axial length and in refractive errors. A faster axial length elongation was observed in each eye of Twin B during the two-year study period. The overall change in axial length was 0.52mm (OD) and 0.70 (OS) in Twin A and 0.77mm (OD) and 0.82mm (OS) in Twin B. In terms of cycloplegic refractive errors (SER), one month after ceasing lens wear (after completion of the two-year study), the increase (from baseline) were 11% (OD) and 48% (OS) in Twin A and 87% (OD) and 67% (OS) in Twin B.\nOrtho-k is more effective in controlling myopic progression in terms of axial elongation than wearing SVLs in this pair of identical twins.",

    "abstract": "To investigate if cortisol alone or in interaction with other risk factors (familial risk, the serotonin transporter genotype, neuroticism and life events (LEs)) predicts onset of psychiatric disorder in healthy individuals at heritable risk.\nIn a high-risk study, 234 healthy monozygotic and dizygotic twins with or without a co-twin history of affective disorder (high and low risk twins) were baseline assessed. Participants were followed up for seven years and then reassessed with a personal interview revealing whether they had developed psychiatric illness.\n36 participants (15.4%) developed psychiatric disorder. Using Cox proportional hazards ratio (HR) estimates neither morning nor evening salivary cortisol at baseline did predict illness onset. In multivariate Cox models, the two-way interaction between morning cortisol and LEs lifetime before baseline was significantly associated with onset. Further, the HR of onset was higher concerning individuals carrying the short allele of the 5-HTTPLR and having experienced more LEs lifetime. Familial risk for affective disorder predicted illness and the risk of onset was further increased in individuals at familial risk carrying the short allele of the 5-HTTPLR.\nCortisol levels alone do not increase the risk of onset of psychiatric illness but the interaction of a lower cortisol level and the experience of more LEs do. The 5-HTTLPR genotype seems to interact and contribute to increased stress vulnerability in combination with other stress indicators of illness thereby adding to the risk of subsequent psychopathology.",

We estimated the proportions of variance explained by questionnaire-measured breast cancer risk factors and by unmeasured residual familial factors.\nFor 544 MZ and 339 DZ twin pairs and 1,558 non-twin sisters from 1,564 families, mammographic density was measured using the computer-assisted method Cumulus. We estimated associations using multilevel mixed-effects linear regression and studied familial aspects using a multivariate normal model.\nThe proportions of variance explained by age, body mass index (BMI), and other risk factors, respectively, were 4%, 1%, and 4% for dense area; 7%, 14%, and 4% for percent dense area; and 7%, 40%, and 1% for nondense area. Associations with dense area and percent dense area were in opposite directions than for nondense area. After adjusting for measured factors, the correlations of dense area with percent dense area and nondense area were 0.84 and -0.46, respectively. The MZ, DZ, and sister pair correlations were 0.59, 0.28, and 0.29 for dense area; 0.57, 0.30, and 0.28 for percent dense area; and 0.56, 0.27, and 0.28 for nondense area (SE = 0.02, 0.04, and 0.03, respectively).\nUnder the classic twin model, 50% to 60% (SE = 5%) of the variance of mammographic density measures that predict breast cancer risk are due to undiscovered genetic factors, and the remainder to as yet unknown individual-specific, nongenetic factors.\nMuch remains to be learnt about the genetic and environmental determinants of mammographic density.",

    "abstract": "Diurnal preference changes across the lifespan. However, the mechanisms underlying this age-related shift are poorly understood. The aim of this twin study was to determine the extent to which genetic and environmental influences on diurnal preference are moderated by age. Seven hundred and sixty-eight monozygotic and 674 dizygotic adult twin pairs participating in the University of Washington Twin Registry completed the reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire as a measure of diurnal preference. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 93 years (mean\u2009=\u200936.23, SD\u2009=\u200915.54) and were categorized on the basis of age into three groups: younger adulthood (19-35 years, n\u2009=\u20091715 individuals), middle adulthood (36-64 years, n\u2009=\u20091003 individuals) and older adulthood (65+ years, n\u2009=\u2009168 individuals). Increasing age was associated with an increasing tendency towards morningness (r\u2009=\u20090.42, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Structural equation modeling techniques parsed the variance in diurnal preference into genetic and environmental influences for the total sample as well as for each age group separately. Additive genetic influences accounted for 52%[46-57%], and non-shared environmental influences 48%[43-54%], of the total variance in diurnal preference. In comparing univariate genetic models between age groups, the best-fitting model was one in which the parameter estimates for younger adults and older adults were equated, in comparison with middle adulthood. For younger and older adulthood, additive genetic influences accounted for 44%[31-49%] and non-shared environmental influences 56%[49-64%] of variance in diurnal preference, whereas for middle adulthood these estimates were 34%[21-45%] and 66%[55-79%], respectively. Therefore, genetic influences on diurnal preference are attenuated in middle adulthood. Attenuation is likely driven by the increased importance of work and family responsibilities during this life stage, in comparison with younger and older adulthood when these factors may be less influential in determining sleep-wake timing. These findings have implications for studies aimed at identifying specific non-shared environmental influences, as well as molecular genetic studies aimed at identifying specific polymorphisms associated with diurnal preference.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disorders have emerged as major causes of inherited neurologic disease. Despite being well recognized for more than 2 decades, the clinical presentation continues to broaden. The phenotypic heterogeneity is partly owing to different percentage levels of mutant mtDNA heteroplasmy in different tissues, but the factors influencing this are poorly understood.\nThis case report describes monozygotic male twins with ptosis, optic atrophy, and recent-onset intractable myoclonic epilepsy. The assessment of respiratory chain enzyme activities in the muscle from 1 twin revealed a severe and isolated defect involving mitochondrial complex I. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing revealed a pathogenic m.14487T>C MTND6 mutation, which was present at very high levels of heteroplasmy in muscle (84%) and lower levels in blood (15%), urinary epithelium (75%), and buccal mucosa (58%). Of particular interest, his identical twin was found to harbor very similar levels of the m.14487T>C mutation in his blood, urine, buccal mucosa, and hair follicle DNA samples, while the presence of low levels in the mother's tissues confirmed maternal transmission.\nIt was shown that m14487T>C can also cause the unusual combination of optic atrophy, ptosis, and encephalomyopathy leading to intractable seizures. Near-identical heteroplasmy levels in different tissues in both siblings support a nuclear genetic mechanism controlling the tissue segregation of mtDNA mutations.",

    "abstract": "To describe a pregnancy that was complicated by the virilization of the mother and two 46XX infants.\nWe outline the clinical presentation and diagnosis of the virilization of a mother and her twins, reviewing pertinent literature.\nWe report the case of a 40-year-old Caucasian female who conceived a trichorionic triplet pregnancy through in vitro fertilization (IVF) but underwent cytoreduction at 13 weeks of gestation, leaving a diamniotic dichorionic twin pregnancy. At 16 weeks of gestation the mother experienced increasing acne, facial hair, and deepening of her voice. Due to preeclampsia, the twins were delivered via caesarean section at 33 weeks of gestation. The infants had male-appearing external genitalia (Prader score IV-V) but no palpable gonads. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia was ruled out for both twins and they were both found to have a uterus and a 46XX karyotype. Maternal testosterone level was elevated at birth (1,981 ng/dL), but the infants had normal levels. Maternal testosterone levels returned to normal after delivery, consistent with a luteoma of pregnancy, although imaging was negative for a mass.\nThis is the second reported case of complete virilization associated with a luteoma of pregnancy. Whether or not IVF and related procedures increase the risk for a luteoma and whether or not fetal reduction procedures disrupt placental aromatases and increase the risk of virilization in the face of elevated androgen levels are questions that require further research.",

    "abstract": "Risks associated with parental separation have received limited attention in research on children of parents with substance use disorders. We examined early substance involvement as a function of parental separation during childhood and parental alcohol and cannabis dependence.\nData were drawn from 1318 adolescent offspring of monozygotic (MZ) or dizygotic (DZ) Australian twin parents. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted predicting age at first use of alcohol, first alcohol intoxication, first use and first regular use of cigarettes, and first use of cannabis, from parental separation and both parent and cotwin substance dependence. Parent and cotwin alcohol and cannabis dependence were initially modeled separately, with post hoc tests for equality of effects.\nWith few exceptions, risks associated with parental alcohol versus cannabis dependence could be equated, with results largely suggestive of genetic transmission of risk from parental substance (alcohol or cannabis) dependence broadly defined. Controlling for parental substance dependence, parental separation was a strong predictor for all substance use variables, especially through age 13.\nTogether, findings underscore the importance of parental separation as a risk-factor for early substance involvement over and above both genetic and environmental influences specific to parental alcohol and cannabis dependence.",

    "abstract": "The continuing studies of the teeth and faces of Australian twins and their families in the Craniofacial Biology Research Group in the School of Dentistry at the University of Adelaide began 30 years ago. Three main cohorts of twins have been recruited, enabling various objectives and specific hypotheses to be addressed about the roles of genetic, epigenetic and environmental influences on human dentofacial growth and development, as well as oral health. This paper highlights some key findings arising from these studies, emphasizing those of direct relevance to practising oral health professionals. We also draw on published literature to review the significant developments in relation to the use of precision 2D and 3D imaging equipment, the application of modern molecular techniques, and the development of sophisticated computer software for analysing genetic relationships and comparing complex shapes. Such developments are valuable for current and future work. Apart from the classical or traditional twin model, there are several other twin models that can be used in research to clarify the relative contributions of genetic, epigenetic and environmental contributions to phenotypic variation. The monozygotic (MZ) co-twin model is one particularly valuable method, given that examination of only one pair of MZ twins can provide considerable insights into underlying causes of observed variation. This model can be used in a dental practice environment, with oral health professionals having the opportunity to explore differences in orofacial structures between MZ co-twins who are attending as patients. As researchers have become more aware of the complexities of the interactions between the genome, the epigenome and the environment during development, there is the need to collect more phenotypic data and define new phenotypes that will better characterize variations in growth processes and health status. When coupled with powerful new genetic approaches, including genome-wide association studies and linkage analyses, exciting opportunities are opening up to unravel the causes of problems in craniofacial growth and common oral diseases in human populations.",

    "abstract": "Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a potential biomarker of affective disorder. However, longitudinal studies evaluating a potential predictive role of BDNF on subsequent psychopathology are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate whether BDNF alone or in interaction with the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism predict onset of affective disorder in healthy individuals at heritable risk for affective disorder. In a high-risk study, we assessed whole blood levels of BDNF in 234 healthy monozygotic and dizygotic twins with or without a co-twin history of affective disorder (high and low risk twins, respectively). Participants were followed up longitudinally with questionnaires at 6-month intervals for mean seven years and then reassessed with a personal interview to obtain information about whether they had developed psychiatric illness. At follow-up 36 participants (15.4%) had developed psychiatric disorder. Cox regression analysis revealed that BDNF levels at baseline were not associated with onset of illness in this explorative study. Further, two-way interactions between BDNF levels and the Val66Met polymorphism or between familial risk and the Val66Met polymorphism did not predict illness onset.",

We describe a pair of monozygotic twins who showed second premolar and third molar agenesis, albeit with different expressions. We studied the DNA of two genes, paired domain box gene 9 (PAX9) and muscle segment homeodomain-homeobox1 (MSX1), encoding transcription factors that earlier studies found were involved in the manifestation of this condition. No specific causative mutation was found. However, we detected a C\u2192T change in MSX1 exon 2 in both twins, suggesting that this polymorphism might be involved in the trait's expression.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the perinatal outcome of three types of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR).\nFrom January 2005 to June 2012, clinical data of 42 pairs of MCDA twins (84 fetuses) with sIUGR and 71 pairs of normal MCDA twins (142 fetuses) in the same period were analyzed retrospectively in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. Fetuses with sIUGR were classified into three groups based on umbilical artery Doppler flow.There were 25 cases of type I, 11 cases of type II and 6 cases of type III. The perinatal outcome was compared between sIUGR and normal MCDA twins, and among the three types of sIUGR as well. Perinatal outcomes included gestational age at delivery, rate of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), birth weight, intertwin discordance of birth weight, neonatal death and survival rate at 6 months.\n(1) The gestational age of sIUGR at delivery was significantly earlier than the control group [(34\u00b13), (36\u00b12) weeks, respectively], and the rate of IUFD of both fetuses of sIUGR was significantly higher (4.8%, 0, respectively). In the sIUGR group, the average birth weight of large or small twins [(2130\u00b1350), (1520\u00b1400) g, respectively] was smaller than those in the control group [(2470\u00b1500), (2340\u00b1460) g, respectively]. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.05, P<0.01, respectively). The intertwin discordance of birth weight in sIUGR group was significantly larger (27.6%) than the control group (4.0%, P<0.01). (2) The gestational age at delivery in type II and type III [(34\u00b15), (34\u00b12) weeks, respectively] was significantly earlier than the control group (P<0.05). The rate of IUFD of both fetuses in type II (18%) was significantly higher than in type I (0) and the control group (0, P<0.05). In sIUGR group, the average birth weight of small twins in type I, type II and type III was (1640\u00b1430), (1330\u00b1310) and (1500\u00b1380) g respectively, all of which were significantly smaller than that in the control group (P<0.05). The average birth weight of small twins in type II was smaller than in type I and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). In sIUGR group, the intertwin discordance of birth weight in type I, type II and type III was 24.1%, 34.6%, 31.3% respectively, all of which were significantly larger than that in the control group (4.0%, P<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences of the intertwin discordance of birth weight among the three types of sIUGR (P>0.05). Survival rate at 6 months in type II (64%) was significantly lower than in type I (92%) and the control group (91.5%, P<0.01).\nThe perinatal outcome of MCDA twins with sIUGR is poor. The outcome is different among the three types of sIUGR, and typeIIis the worst. Type II is associated with a high risk of intrauterine fetal demise. It is important to monitor the intrauterine situation closely.",

    "abstract": "Not all obese individuals display the metabolic disturbances commonly associated with excess fat accumulation. Mechanisms maintaining this 'metabolically healthy obesity' (MHO) are as yet unknown. We aimed to study different fat depots and transcriptional pathways in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) as related to the MHO phenomenon.\nSixteen rare young adult obesity-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs (intra-pair difference (\u2206) in BMI \u2265 3 kg/m(2)), aged 22.8-35.8 years, were examined for detailed characteristics of metabolic health (subcutaneous, intra-abdominal and liver fat [magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy]), OGTT, lipids, adipokines and C-reactive protein (CRP). Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 chips were used to analyse transcriptomics pathways related to mitochondrial function and inflammation in SAT.\nBased on liver fat accumulation, two metabolically different subgroups emerged. In half (8/16) of the pairs (\u2206weight 17.1 \u00b1 2.0 kg), the obese co-twin had significantly higher liver fat (\u2206718%), 78% increase in AUC insulin during OGTT and CRP, significantly more disturbance in the lipid profile and greater tendency for hypertension compared with the lean co-twin. In these obese co-twins, SAT expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, fatty acid oxidation and adipocyte differentiation pathways were downregulated and chronic inflammation upregulated. In the other eight pairs (\u2206weight 17.4 \u00b1 2.8 kg), the obese co-twin did not differ from the non-obese co-twin in liver fat (\u22068%), insulin sensitivity, CRP, lipids, blood pressure or SAT transcriptomics.\nOur results suggest that maintenance of high mitochondrial transcription and lack of inflammation in SAT are associated with low liver fat and MHO.",

    "abstract": "The current study investigated how the brain structure-function relationships between covert and overt verbal fluency in monozygotic handedness discordant (MzHd) twins relates to broader attentional measures. Evidence presented here shows that the structure-function correlation demonstrated between functional cerebral lateralisation and corpus callosum widths 22-39, contiguous with Broca's area and the middle frontal gyri (Gurd et al. in Brain Struct Funct 218:491-509, 2013), is not an artefact of attention. Twenty-five pairs of female MzHd twins performed a verbal switching task titrated for number of switches. The paradigm permits calculation of switch rates and costs. The switch rate and cost varied as a function of number of switches (1, 2, 3). There were no differences in any measure in relation to right-left handedness in twin pairs. This was supported by large and significant within-twin pair correlations. Atypical functional lateralisation of inferior and middle frontal lobes does not appear to be associated with better or worse performance on verbal task-switching. Discordant lateralisation for verbal fluency does not predict behavioural performance profiles in MzHd twins. This evidence is compatible with a view that attentional components of verbal fluency task performance may have significant heritable components. It does not indicate that neural correlates of frontal cerebral laterality for verbal fluency in MzHd twins are significantly accountable for by heritable components.",

    "abstract": "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a severe, systemic illness characterized by persistent, debilitating and medically unexplained fatigue. The etiology and pathophysiology of CFS remains obscure, and diagnosis is formulated through the patient's history and exclusion of other medical causes. Thereby, the availability of biomarkers for CFS could be useful for clinical research. In the present study, we used a proteomic approach to evaluate the global changes in the salivary profile in a couple of monozygotic twins who were discordant for CFS. The aim was to evaluate differences of salivary protein expression in the CFS patient in respect to his healthy twin.\nSaliva samples were submitted to two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). The gels were stained with Sypro, and a comparison between CFS subject and the healthy one was performed by the software Progenesis Same Spot including the Analysis of variance (ANOVA test). The proteins spot found with a \u22652-fold spot quantity change and p<0.05 were identified by Nano-liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. To validate the expression changes found with 2DE of 5 proteins (14-3-3 protein zeta/delta, cyclophilin A, Cystatin-C, Protein S100-A7, and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein), we used the western blot analysis. Moreover, proteins differentially expressed were functionally analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software with the aim to determine the predominant canonical pathways and the interaction network involved.\nThe analysis of the protein profiles allowed us to find 13 proteins with a different expression in CFS in respect to control. Nine spots were up-regulated in CFS and 4 down-regulated. These proteins belong to different functional classes, such as inflammatory response, immune system and metabolism. In particular, as shown by the pathway analysis, the network built with our proteins highlights the involvement of inflammatory response in CFS pathogenesis.\nThis study shows the presence of differentially expressed proteins in the saliva of the couple of monozygotic twins discordant for CFS, probably related to the disease. Consequently, we believe the proteomic approach could be useful both to define a panel of potential diagnostic biomarkers and to shed new light on the comprehension of the pathogenetic pathways of CFS.",

    "abstract": "Based on molecular-dynamics simulations validated with quantum-mechanical calculations, we predict that (111) twin planes in a [111]-oriented GaAs nanowire attain attractive interactions mediated by surface strain. This gives rise to a self-replication mechanism that continuously generates a twin superlattice in a nanowire during growth. We demonstrate significant implications of the twin-twin interaction for the electronic, mechanical, and chemical properties of nanowires. These unique properties suggest potential applications such as catalysts for solar fuel production and nanoscale mechanical dampers.",

    "abstract": "Our appearance changes over time, yet we can recognize ourselves in photographs from across the lifespan. Researchers have extensively studied self-recognition in photographs and have proposed that specific neural correlates are involved, but few studies have examined self-recognition using images from different periods of life. Here we compared ERP responses to photographs of participants when they were 5-15, 16-25, and 26-45 years old. We found marked differences between the responses to photographs from these time periods in terms of the neural markers generally assumed to reflect (i) the configural processing of faces (i.e., the N170), (ii) the matching of the currently perceived face to a representation already stored in memory (i.e., the P250), and (iii) the retrieval of information about the person being recognized (i.e., the N400). There was no uniform neural signature of visual self-recognition. To test whether there was anything specific to self-recognition in these brain responses, we also asked participants to identify photographs of their dizygotic twins taken from the same time periods. Critically, this allowed us to minimize the confounding effects of exposure, for it is likely that participants have been similarly exposed to each other's faces over the lifespan. The same pattern of neural response emerged with only one exception: the neural marker reflecting the retrieval of mnemonic information (N400) differed across the lifespan for self but not for twin. These results, as well as our novel approach using twins and photographs from across the lifespan, have wide-ranging consequences for the study of self-recognition and the nature of our personal identity through time.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to characterize multiple psychotic experiences, each assessed on a spectrum of severity (ie, quantitatively), in a general population sample of adolescents. Over five thousand 16-year-old twins and their parents completed the newly devised Specific Psychotic Experiences Questionnaire (SPEQ); a subsample repeated it approximately 9 months later. SPEQ was investigated in terms of factor structure, intersubscale correlations, frequency of endorsement and reported distress, reliability and validity, associations with traits of anxiety, depression and personality, and sex differences. Principal component analysis revealed a 6-component solution: paranoia, hallucinations, cognitive disorganization, grandiosity, anhedonia, and parent-rated negative symptoms. These components formed the basis of 6 subscales. Correlations between different experiences were low to moderate. All SPEQ subscales, except Grandiosity, correlated significantly with traits of anxiety, depression, and neuroticism. Scales showed good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity. Girls endorsed more paranoia, hallucinations, and cognitive disorganization; boys reported more grandiosity and anhedonia and had more parent-rated negative symptoms. As in adults at high risk for psychosis and with psychotic disorders, psychotic experiences in adolescents are characterized by multiple components. The study of psychotic experiences as distinct dimensional quantitative traits is likely to prove an important strategy for future research, and the SPEQ is a self- and parent-report questionnaire battery that embodies this approach.",

For males, females and both genders together, the concordance rate for dizygotic twins is approximately twice that of non-twin siblings.

Three types of opsoclonus that occur in infancy have been identified, 2 of which are associated with a systemic or neurologic condition. The third is a benign condition that occurs transiently in healthy neonates and preterm babies. We report a case of 2 healthy twins who presented with transient opsoclonus, which was confined only to the vertical plane and manifested only in a supine position. Opsoclonus disappeared when the cheek was tapped. These eye movements began at 3 months and completely resolved by 6 months of age.",

    "abstract": "The early years in life are increasingly recognized as a critical period for the development of diet-related behavioral traits. However, discussions continue on the relative role of genes and the environment in determining dietary intake, particularly in young children for whom detailed dietary information is limited.\nThis study tested the hypothesis that diet in early childhood is primarily determined by the environment rather than by genes. A secondary aim was to characterize the early childhood diet.\nA classic twin design used 3-d dietary data collected at age 21 mo from the Gemini cohort. From the full sample of 2402 families with twins, dietary diaries were available for 1216 twin pairs (384 monozygotic and 832 dizygotic pairs) after exclusions. Intakes of macronutrients, food, and beverages were estimated. Twin analyses quantified the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to population variation in intake.\nAt age 21 mo, children consumed small portions of a wide range of family foods. The shared environment was the predominant determinant, contributing between 66% (95% CI: 52%, 77%; milk-based desserts) and 97% (95% CI: 95%, 98%; juice) of the variation in intake. Genetic factors were estimated to account for between 4% (95% CI: 0%, 10%; savory snacks) and 18% (95% CI: 14%, 23%; bread) of dietary intake variation.\nShared environmental influences are the predominant drivers of dietary intake in very young children, indicating the importance of factors such as the home food environment and parental behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Occupations and psychosocial working conditions have rarely been investigated as predictors of disability pension in population-based samples. This study investigated how occupational groups and psychosocial working conditions are associated with future disability pension due to musculoskeletal diagnoses, accounting for familial factors in the associations.\nA sample of 24,543 same-sex Swedish twin individuals was followed from 1993 to 2008 using nationwide registries. Baseline data on occupations were categorized into eight sector-defined occupational groups. These were further used to reflect psychosocial working conditions by applying the job strain scores of a Job Exposure Matrix. Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) were estimated.\nDuring the 12-year (average) follow-up, 7% of the sample was granted disability pension due to musculoskeletal diagnoses. Workers in health care and social work; agriculture, forestry and fishing; transportation; production and mining; and the service and military work sectors were two to three times more likely to receive a disability pension than those in the administration and management sector. Each single unit decrease in job demands and each single unit increase in job control and social support significantly predicted disability pension. Individuals with high work strain or an active job had a lower hazard ratio of disability pension, whereas a passive job predicted a significantly higher hazard ratio. Accounting for familial confounding did not alter these results.\nOccupational groups and psychosocial working conditions seem to be independent of familial confounding, and hence represent risk factors for disability pension due to musculoskeletal diagnoses. This means that preventive measures in these sector-defined occupational groups and specific psychosocial working conditions might prevent disability pension due to musculoskeletal diagnoses.",

Workers in health care and social work; agriculture, forestry and fishing; transportation; production and mining; and the service and military work sectors were two to three times more likely to receive a disability pension than those in the administration and management sector. Each single unit decrease in job demands and each single unit increase in job control and social support significantly predicted disability pension. Individuals with high work strain or an active job had a lower hazard ratio of disability pension, whereas a passive job predicted a significantly higher hazard ratio.

    "abstract": "To evaluate data regarding neonatal mortality and short term morbidity among iatrogenic late preterm (ILP) and spontaneous late preterm (SLP) twin births, and to estimate whether medical interventions - induction of labor in this particular context, are associated with better or poorer outcomes.\nRetrospective analysis of 110 late preterm dichorionic twin pregnancies was performed basing on medical charts data. All twins were delivered in years 2005-2011 at the 1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Medical University of Warsaw Late preterm twins, defined as those delivered between 34 + 0-36+ 6 weeks of gestation, were divided into spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm births. The primary outcomes of the study were various neonatal adverse events, including one of the following per pregnancy: admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), respiratory disorders (RD) and pneumonia, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), sepsis, NEC and jaundice requiring phototherapy Mann-Whitney U-test and chi-squared test were used and logistic regression performed to calculate odds ratio, with p value < 0.05 considered significant.\nThere were 69 (62.7%) spontaneous and 41 (37.3%) iatrogenic late preterm twins. There were no differences in maternal characteristics, mode of delivery and newborns' Apgar scores. The mean birth weight did not differ significantly between the groups. There was one case of perinatal death of one twin in ILP group. Preeclampsia (31.7%) and IUGR (17%) were the most frequent indications for labor induction in ILR Women in the ILP group were administered steroid treatment for lung maturation more frequently than SLP group due to pregnancy complications (73.17% vs. 30.44%; p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, ILP twins were at higher risk of respiratory disorders (41.46% vs. 15.94%; p = 0.003--significant either with or without pneumonia) and NICU admission (31.71% vs. 14.49%; p = 0.032) than SLP twins. The only two independent factors influencing the occurrence of poor neonatal outcome were gestational age in weeks (OR 0.57; 95% Cl 0.34-0.94) and preeclampsia (OR 5.01; 95% CI 1.51-16.67). In the additional analysis of gestational age odds ratio, only the delivery at 34 weeks of gestation increased the incidence of adverse neonatal outcome almost five times (OR 4.94, 95% Cl: 1.64-14.88). The rate of cesarean delivery in the SLP was 81.61%, while in the ILP it reached 90.23% (p = 0.17).\nLate prematurity in twin pregnancies is associated with higher risk of neonatal morbidity than in term twins. Iatrogenic late preterm birth increases the risk of NICU admission and respiratory disorders in neonates in comparison to spontaneous late preterm birth. Despite the fact that respiratory complications are generally mild and mostly temporary there is a need for careful evaluation of indications for delivery in that particular group.",

    "abstract": "Clinic and long-term average blood pressure (BP) are heritable traits with estimates of heritability ranging from 0.31 to 0.68. Long-term visit-to-visit BP variability (BPV) is emerging as a new cardiovascular risk predictor, though it is unclear if this is completely independent of BP. We hypothesize that BPV should demonstrate the same pattern of additive genetic, shared environmental and unique environmental variance as BP, if both are phenotypic surrogates.\nWe studied 2889 twin pairs not on any BP-lowering therapy from the Twins UK cohort, and estimated the additive genetic variance for baseline BP, long-term average BP, BP trajectory (rate of change of BP in mmHg/year) and BPV (coefficient of variation and average real variability over an average of 3.2 visits). Heritability estimates were obtained by structural equation modelling adjusting for age, age, sex and BMI.\nThe heritabilities for baseline SBP and DBP were 0.51 (95% confidence interval 0.49, 0.53) and 0.56 (0.54, 0.58); long-term average SBP and DBP were 0.56 (0.53, 0.59) and 0.61 (0.58, 0.64); and systolic and diastolic trajectories over 10 years were 0.49 (0.46, 0.52) and 0.29 (0.27, 0.32), respectively. Both overall systolic and diastolic BPV showed no additive genetic variance contributing to the phenotypic variation, but after stratification by age, the younger subgroup (<51 years) showed heritability estimates of 0.44 (0.38, 0.50) for coefficient of variation and 0.35 (0.29, 0.41) for average real variability.\nAge is a major factor that influences heritability estimation of BPV and it is likely that BPV in younger and older age groups may reflect different pathological phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The preterm gut microbiome is a complex dynamic community influenced by genetic and environmental factors and is implicated in the pathogenesis of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and sepsis. We aimed to explore the longitudinal development of the gut microbiome in preterm twins to determine how shared environmental and genetic factors may influence temporal changes and compared this to the expressed breast milk (EBM) microbiome. Stool samples (n = 173) from 27 infants (12 twin pairs and 1 triplet set) and EBM (n = 18) from 4 mothers were collected longitudinally. All samples underwent PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) analysis and a selected subset underwent 454 pyrosequencing. Stool and EBM shared a core microbiome dominated by Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, and Staphylococcaceae. The gut microbiome showed greater similarity between siblings compared to unrelated individuals. Pyrosequencing revealed a reduction in diversity and increasing dominance of Escherichia sp. preceding NEC that was not observed in the healthy twin. Antibiotic treatment had a substantial effect on the gut microbiome, reducing Escherichia sp. and increasing other Enterobacteriaceae. This study demonstrates related preterm twins share similar gut microbiome development, even within the complex environment of neonatal intensive care. This is likely a result of shared genetic and immunomodulatory factors as well as exposure to the same maternal microbiome during birth, skin contact and exposure to EBM. Environmental factors including antibiotic exposure and feeding are additional significant determinants of community structure, regardless of host genetics.",

    "abstract": "Menarche or first menstrual period is a landmark in reproductive life span and it is the most prominent change of puberty. The timing of menarche can be under the influence of genes as well as individual environmental factors interacting with genetic factors.\nOur study objectives were (a) to investigate the heritability of age of menarche in twins, (b) to obtain the association between age of menarche and childhood factors, and reproductive events/behavior, (c) to examine whether or not having a male co-twin affects early/late menarche.\nA group of female-female identical (n = 108, 54 pairs), non-identical twins (n = 68, 34 pairs) and 17 females from opposite-sex twin sets were identified from twin registries of Malaysia and Iran. Genetic analysis was performed via two methods of Falconers' formula and maximum likelihood.\nHeritability was found to be 66% using Falconers' formula and 15% using univariate twin analysis. Model analysis revealed that shared environmental factors have a major contribution in determining the age of menarche (82%) followed by non-shared environment (18%).\nResult of this study is consistent with that of the literature. Timing of menarche could be under the influence of shared and non-shared environmental effects. Hirsutism was found to have a higher frequency among subjects with late menarche. There was no significant difference in age of menarche between females of opposite-sex twins and females of same-sex twins.\nIt is concluded that twin models provide a powerful means of examining the total genetic contribution to age of menarche. Longitudinal studies of twins may clarify the type of environmental effects that determine the age of menarche.",

    "abstract": "To study the association between velamentous cord insertion (VCI) and different outcomes in monochorionic twins with and without twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).\nWe recorded the cord insertion type in all consecutive monochorionic placentas examined in two tertiary medical centers. The association between VCI and several outcomes was estimated.\nA total of 630 monochorionic placentas with TTTS (n = 304) and without TTTS (n = 326) were studied. The incidence of VCI in the TTTS and non-TTTS group was 36.8% and 35.9%, respectively (P = 0.886). The presence of VCI in one twin was significantly associated with small for gestational age (SGA) status (odds ratio [OR] 1.45, 95% CI 1.13, 1.87) and severe birth weight discordance (OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.93, 4.96). Our results also showed significant interaction between TTTS and VCI when we considered intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) and gestational age (GA) at birth. The prevalence of IUFD in monochorionic pregnancies without TTTS increased from 4.6% to 14.1% in the presence of VCI (P = 0.027). In the TTTS group, the prevalence of IUFD was comparable in the absence or presence of VCI. Similarly, GA at birth was significantly lower in the presence of VCI only in the non-TTTS group.\nOur findings suggest that VCI is not associated with the development of TTTS but increases the risk of adverse outcomes. Both VCI and TTTS independently increase the prevalence of IUFD and lower GA at birth in a similar way, showing that VCI is an important indicator of adverse perinatal outcome in monochorionic twins.",

    "abstract": "The role of specific gut microbes in shaping body composition remains unclear. We transplanted fecal microbiota from adult female twin pairs discordant for obesity into germ-free mice fed low-fat mouse chow, as well as diets representing different levels of saturated fat and fruit and vegetable consumption typical of the U.S. diet. Increased total body and fat mass, as well as obesity-associated metabolic phenotypes, were transmissible with uncultured fecal communities and with their corresponding fecal bacterial culture collections. Cohousing mice harboring an obese twin's microbiota (Ob) with mice containing the lean co-twin's microbiota (Ln) prevented the development of increased body mass and obesity-associated metabolic phenotypes in Ob cage mates. Rescue correlated with invasion of specific members of Bacteroidetes from the Ln microbiota into Ob microbiota and was diet-dependent. These findings reveal transmissible, rapid, and modifiable effects of diet-by-microbiota interactions.",

    "abstract": "Single intrauterine fetal demise in monochorionic (MC) twins may result in acute exsanguination from the surviving twin into the low-pressure circulation of the demised co-twin through the vascular anastomoses. This may lead to severe hypoxic-ischemic injury in the surviving twin due to hypovolemia, hypotension and anemia, resulting in multiorgan damage. Most studies in single fetal demise in MC twin pregnancies have reported on the risk of cerebral injury. The aim of our study was to explore the incidence and severity of renal damage in surviving MC twins after intrauterine co-twin death. We reviewed all cases of MC twins with single fetal demise presented over a 10-year period at our center. One of the 44 (2.3%) surviving co-twins was diagnosed with severe renal damage. We describe this case in detail, as it provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of renal and other organ failure after MC co-twin death.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate short and medium term outcomes of children born of monochorionic pregnancies complicated by twin-twin transfusion syndrome treated by fetoscopic laser surgery.\nThis was a retrospective observational study performed between May 2007 and 2012. Neonatal data was from 45 patients under 5 years of age. The prospective observational study was of the neurologic outcome of these children using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), 2nd edition, French version, at up to 5 years of age.\nNeurologic assessment at discharge from maternity unit was normal for 41 infants (93.2%). Logistic regression suggested that the risk of neurosensory sequelae was significantly related to the status of donor [odds ratio=4.62 (1.18; 18.0)] and significantly preterm birth <32 weeks of gestation [odds ratio=5.50 (1.38; 21.9)]. Eleven questionnaires were considered abnormal (31.1%). Two children presented a severe neurologic abnormality (5.7%). There was no significant correlation between any area of the questionnaire and status at birth (donor or recipient).\nThe data from our cohort, particularly as regards neurologic outcome, were satisfactory and concordant with previously published results. The use of the ASQ as a screening tool for neurologic outcome in children is original, which allowed in our cohort to highlight early neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric and parasitic conjoined twins are extremely rare anomalies of monochorionic monoamniotic twins, consisting of an incomplete twin attached to the fully developed body of the co-twin. Sonographic examination is essential for prenatal diagnosis as early detection of fetal anomalies with poor prognosis provides a chance to deliver the infant vaginally for the mother. We herein describe a case with a prenatal diagnosis of a parasitic twin using three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound. The clear images obtained with 3-D ultrasound helped in counseling the parents. Making an early prenatal diagnosis of severe fetal anomalies with careful and sophisticated sonographic examinations should be warranted.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare entity. Only few cases have been reported in the medical literature. They are a rare and exclusive type of monozygotic twins. They are caused by a faulty division of the embryonic disk. Due to high post-natal morbidity and mortality, an early pre-natal diagnosis is a must. All the monozygotic twins should be carefully screened for conjoinnment and if it is present, the type and the degree of sharing of the foetal organs should be delineated. There are many associated anomalies, of which congenital heart defects are the major prognostic factors. Here, we are reporting a case of thoraco-omphalopagus in which there was sharing of the foetal heart, liver and the intestinal loops.",

A PFO is a common incidental finding in infants and children. However, paradoxical emboli are not common in infants, and so PFO closure is rarely indicated in this age group. We present two cases of PFO closures in identical 8 kg twin boys with Hurler's syndrome who had central lines for planned bone marrow transplants, with embolic stroke in one. We discuss the treatment options as well as the specific challenges based on the patients' age, size, and diagnoses. We also discuss the technical aspects and safety of percutaneous PFO closure.",

    "abstract": "Accelerated infant growth is associated with an altered, mostly adverse adult cardiometabolic risk profile. The importance of genetic and environmental factors to these associations is unclear.\nThe objective was to examine the importance of genetic and environmental factors in the associations between infant growth and adult cardiometabolic risk factors (anthropometric characteristics, lipids, insulin sensitivity, leptin, blood pressure, and fibrinogen) in twins.\nCardiometabolic risk factors were assessed in 240 twin pairs (aged 18-34 y) from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. Infant growth was defined as change in weight z score. We regressed intrapair differences in growth during 4 growth windows (0-1, 1-6, 6-12, and 12-24 mo) against intrapair differences in the risk factors in monozygotic and dizygotic twins separately.\nWithin monozygotic twin pairs only, associations between infant growth and most adult lipids, glucose, leptin, and blood pressure (eg, systolic blood pressure: b = 5.95 mm Hg per change in z score, P = 0.01 in monozygotic twins; b = -1.64, P = 0.82 in dizygotic twins from 12 to 24 mo) were found. Within dizygotic twin pairs only, associations between growth and triglycerides and fibrinogen (eg, fibrinogen: b = 0.07 ln mg/dL per change in z score, P = 0.31 in monozygotic twins; b = 0.79, P = 0.01 in dizygotic twins from 0 to 1 mo) were identified. Most associations showed a detrimental effect of accelerated growth, but beneficial associations were also identified (eg, total-to-high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol ratio: b = -0.22 per change in z score from 1 to 6 mo, P = 0.008 in monozygotic twins).\nOur data showed that environmental factors play a role in the associations between infant growth and most adult lipids, glucose, leptin, and blood pressure, whereas genetic factors are involved regarding triglycerides and fibrinogen.",

    "abstract": "To assess the association of mode of conception and sex concordance with neonatal outcomes in very preterm twins.\nTwin pairs born at gestational age \u2264 32 weeks and admitted to a Level 3 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in 2010-2011 were retrospectively identified from the Canadian Neonatal Network\u2122 database. A composite outcome representing neonatal mortality or any severe morbidity (intraventricular hemorrhage grades \u2265 3 or periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity stages \u2265 3, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or necrotizing enterocolitis stages \u2265 2) was compared between twins conceived using assisted reproduction technologies (ARTs) or spontaneously (SP), and tested for association with sex concordance in individual-level and pair-wise multivariable logistic regression analyses.\nStudy subjects included 1,508 twins from 216 ART (53 [25%] male-male, 104 [48%] male-female, and 59 [27%] female-female) and 538 SP (192 [36%] male-male, 123 [23%] male-female, and 223 [41%] female-female) pairs. No statistically significant association was detected between mode of conception and the composite outcome of mortality/morbidities. The composite outcome was significantly higher in same-sex than in opposite-sex twins (OR = 1.68; 95% CI = [1.09, 2.59]). This relationship was most pronounced in ART pairs (OR = 2.25; 95% CI = [1.02, 4.98]), with increased rates in one or both twins from male-male versus opposite-sex ART pairs (OR = 3.0; 95% CI = [1.07, 8.36]).\nSame-sex pairing was associated with higher mortality/morbidities in very preterm twins admitted to the NICU, and can be used in clinical practice to identify twins at higher risk of adverse neonatal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The study aims to determine the differences in maternal and perinatal outcomes between caesarean and vaginal deliveries and the factors affecting vaginal delivery in twin pregnancy.\nAn observational study to audit twin pregnancies delivered at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital between 2002 and 2008. Clinical observations were entered into a questionnaire immediately after the delivery of the women and the mothers and their babies were followed up until the end of the puerperium.\nThere were 5298 deliveries within the study period, out of which 117 were twin deliveries. This gives a twinning rate of 22 per 1000 deliveries. The mean age of the mothers was 30 \u00b1 5.9 years. Twenty-five (21.4%) women were admitted into the hospital for preterm labor. The average gestational age of admission was 32 \u00b1 5.8 weeks and the average duration of hospital stay for preterm labor was 12.6 \u00b1 9.1 days. Other pregnancy complications observed were severe hypertension (14.5%, anemia (9.4%), postpartum hemorrhage (8.5%), puerperal fever (5.1%), abruptio placentae, and diabetic mellitus (2.7%). Fifty-nine women (50.4%) had vaginal deliveries, 5 (4.3%) had vaginal delivery of the leading twin and caesarean delivery of the retained second twin while 53 women (45.3%) were delivered by caesarean section. Forty-eight (41%) women had preterm delivery. Vaginal deliveries were more common than caesarean section among patients that were unbooked than booked P = 0.047 (OR 2.26, 95%CI:0.93-5.53) and those that had cephalic presentation of the leading twin, P = 0.0002 (OR = 4.7 95% CI:2.6-8.2). Vaginal delivery tended toward statistical significance when the fetal weight of the leading twin was 1.5 to 2.5 kg, P = 0.09. The commonest indications for caesarean section were abnormal lies and presentations and hypertension in pregnancy.Two-hundred and seventeen (92.7%) out of a total of 234 fetuses that were delivered in this study were live births and 17 (7.3%) still births. The rate of new born admissions in twin 1 was however higher in those delivered by Caesarean section (39.6%) than those delivered vaginally (29.7%). Indications for admissions into the special baby care units were; prematurity 33 (40.2%), birth asphyxia 15 (18.3%), low birth weight 12 (14.6%), neonatal jaundice 10 (12.2%), and twin-twin transfusion 4 (4.9%). There was a higher rate of early neonatal death in both vaginally delivered twin 1 (9.4%) and twin 2 (11.9%) than those delivered by Caesarean section, 3.8 and 3.5%, respectively.\nCephalic presentation of the leading twin, birth weight less than 2.5 kg, and unbooked women presenting in advanced labor predisposed to vaginal delivery in twin pregnancies. There was however increased risk of still birth and early neonatal deaths especially for the leading twin in vaginal deliveries in unbooked women.",

    "abstract": "Bordetella pertussis or whooping cough is a vaccine-preventable disease that still remains a serious infection in neonates and young infants. We describe two young infants, monozygotic twins, with a severe B. pertussis pneumonia of whom one needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Diagnostic work-up of unexplained hematuria and proteinuria during the illness revealed low serum complement component 3 (C3) levels. During follow-up, C3 levels remained low (400-600\u00a0mg/L). Extensive analysis of the persistent low C3 levels revealed an unknown heterozygous mutation in the C3 gene in both siblings and their mother. This C3 mutation in combination with the specific virulence mechanisms of B. pertussis probably contributed to the severe disease course in these cases.\nWe propose that genetically caused complement disorders should be considered when confronted with severe cases of B. pertussis infection.",

    "abstract": "Although KCNJ11 mutations of the KATP channel within the \u03b2 cell are known to prevent insulin secretion and cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus, the genotype-phenotype correlation continues to be of clinical interest. We report the clinical outcomes in monozygotic twins with neonatal diabetes due to heterozygous mutations in KCNJ11 at R201H. The twins demonstrated concordant clinical outcomes after transitioning from insulin to oral sulfonylurea therapy at 4 months of age. Both twins remained on sulfonylurea therapy while achieving similar growth, development, and metabolic goals. They exhibit marked sensitivity to sulfonylurea therapy with current dosing at 0.05 and 0.06 mg/kg per day at age 5 years which deviates from the approximate maintenance dose of 0.4 mg/kg per day at the time of transition and subsequent follow-up. Metabolic control provided by low-dose sulfonylurea therapy is likely due to early age at transition from insulin to sulfonylurea therapy and possible preservation of endogenous insulin secretion.",

    "abstract": "To examine the heritability of refractive astigmatism in older women.\nAstigmatism was measured with an autorefractor in 88 monozygotic and 82 dizygotic female twin pairs aged 63 to 75 years. The prevalence and distribution of astigmatism and polar values J0 and J45 were estimated by standard statistical methods. Bivariate maximum likelihood model fitting was used to estimate genetic and environmental variance components using information from both eyes.\nMean astigmatism of the more astigmatic eye was 0.93 diopters (D; SD \u00b10.58). Astigmatism of at least 0.25 D, 0.5 D, 0.75 D, or 1.0 D in either eye was present in 99.7%, 88.5%, 66.5%, and 46.2% of cases, respectively. The main direction of astigmatism was against the rule. The age-adjusted quantitative genetic modeling revealed that additive genetic effects accounted for 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.9%-43.8%) of the total variance of astigmatism and for 18% (95% CI, 4%-31%) of the total variance of polar value J45 of both eyes (bivariate model), with the remaining variances due to nongenetic effects. There were no significant correlations between the twin pairs for polar value J0.\nIn elderly female twins, additive genetic effects accounted for one-third of the variance of the amount of astigmatism and only a small fraction of the total variance of polar value J45.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome results from an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Expansion of a maternal premutation allele is the mechanism by which a full mutation allele arises; contraction of a maternal premutation allele is rare. Here we report on both an expansion and contraction of a maternal FMR1 premutation allele in fraternal twins. The propositus was the product of a 29-week gestation twin pregnancy and was referred for FMR1 testing due to developmental delay. A FMR1 full mutation with complete methylation was observed on Southern blot analysis. Evaluation of the maternal FMR1 gene by PCR revealed a normal and premutation allele with CGG repeat numbers of 30 and 93, respectively. Subsequent FMR1 testing on the twin sister of the propositus detected CGG repeat numbers of 30 and 54. The FMR1 CGG repeat number of the reproductive partner was 30. The FMR1 CGG repeat 30 allele in the twin sister was determined to be of paternal origin and the FMR1 allele with a CGG repeat number of 54 was of maternal origin. This observation is particularly interesting not only because of the concomitant donation of a FMR1 expanded and contracted premutation allele in a twin pregnancy but also because of the significant degree of contraction (39 repeats) of the maternal premutation allele.",

    "abstract": "Twins in Africa may be at increased risk of metabolic disorders due to strained conditions in utero, including high exposure to infections. We studied metabolic syndrome (MS) and diabetes mellitus (DM) among young twins and singletons in Guinea-Bissau.\nThe study was cross-sectional and occurred from October 2009 until August 2011 at the Bandim Health Project, a demographic surveillance site in the capital Bissau. Twins and singleton controls between 5 and 32 years were visited at home. Fasting blood samples for metabolic measurements were collected. Zygosity was established genetically for a subset. DM was defined as HbA1c \u22656.5% (48 mmol/mol) and MS by the International Diabetes Federation criteria.\nHbA1c was available for 574 twins and 463 singletons. Mean age was 15.3 years versus 15.8 years, respectively. Eighteen percent of twins were monozygotic. There were no DM cases among twins but one among singletons. A total of 1.4% (8 of 574) of twins had elevated HbA1c (6.0-6.4%, 42-46 mmol/mol) compared with 2.4% (11 of 463) of singletons (P = 0.28). Mean HbA1c was 5.3% (34 mmol/mol) for both groups. MS data were available for 364 twins and 360 singletons. The MS prevalence was 3.0% (11 of 364) among twins and 3.6% (13 of 360) among singletons (P = 0.66). The prevalence of fasting blood glucose (F-glucose) \u22655.6 mmol/L was 34.9% (127 of 364) for twins versus 24.7% (89 of 360) for singletons (P = 0.003). Median homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance did not differ (P = 0.34).\nThe MS and DM prevalences among young individuals in Guinea-Bissau were low. Twins did not have a higher MS and DM burden than singletons, though elevated F-glucose was more common among twins.",

    "abstract": "Precise placement of twin boundaries and stacking faults promises new opportunities to fundamentally manipulate the optical, electrical, and thermal properties of semiconductor nanowires. Here we report on the appearance of consecutive twin boundaries in Si nanowires and show that sidewall morphology governs their spacing. Detailed electron microscopy analysis reveals that thin {111} sidewall facets, which elongate following the first twin boundary (TB1), are responsible for deforming the triple-phase line and favoring the formation of the second twin boundary (TB2). While multiple, geometrically correlated defect planes are known in group III-V nanowires, our findings show that this behavior is also possible in group IV materials.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, monochorionicity has been regarded as synonymous with monozygosity. However, several recent cases of monochorionic dizygotic twins have shown that monochorionic twins can be dizygous. We report a rare case of monochorionic diamnionic, gender-discordant twins who were conceived spontaneously. Initially, a monochorionic placenta was diagnosed by ultrasonography at 8 weeks of gestation and then confirmed by pathology after delivery. The twins had different genders. A comparison of cytogenetic analyses using peripheral blood lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts revealed that chimerism was confined to blood cells. We have experienced two cases of monochorionic dizygotic twins since 2003. These cases suggest that monochorionic dizygotic twins are not as rare as previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Dermatoglyphic asymmetry and diversity traits from a large number of twins (MZ and DZ) were analyzed based on principal factors to evaluate genetic effects and common familial environmental influences on twin data by the use of maximum likelihood-based Variance decomposition analysis. Sample consists of monozygotic (MZ) twins of two sexes (102 male pairs and 138 female pairs) and 120 pairs of dizygotic (DZ) female twins. All asymmetry (DA and FA) and diversity of dermatoglyphic traits were clearly separated into factors. These are perfectly corroborated with the earlier studies in different ethnic populations, which indicate a common biological validity perhaps exists of the underlying component structures of dermatoglyphic characters. Our heritability result in twins clearly showed that DA_F2 is inherited mostly in dominant type (28.0%) and FA_F1 is additive (60.7%), but no significant difference in sexes was observed for these factors. Inheritance is also very prominent in diversity Factor 1, which is exactly corroborated with our previous findings. The present results are similar with the earlier results of finger ridge count diversity in twin data, which suggested that finger ridge count diversity is under genetic control.",

    "abstract": "Body Mass Index (BMI) and skinfolds are common indicators of adiposity. Many studies have shown relationships between the BMI in childhood and adolescence and the BMI in adulthood. Similar correlations were observed for the skinfolds, although they tend to be lower. The aim of this study was to estimate changes with age in the genetic variance and heritability of the BMI and skinfolds among Polish twins born between 1959 and 1965. Observations involved male and female monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, who were measured annually between 8 and 18 years of age. Body Mass Index and skinfold thicknesses at the triceps (TSF), subscapular (SSF) and suprailiac (SIF) sites were measured. Genetic variance and heritability were estimated for individual skinfold thicknesses, the sum of three skinfolds (SUMSF) and BM, separately by age classes for both sexes. Intraclass correlations were significantly higher for MZ twins than for DZ twins in both sexes and across all ages. Heritability estimates were significant for all indicators of adiposity, but varied with age and had different ranges for boys and girls. Estimates of genetic variance were significant for all indicators of adiposity and were higher for girls than for boys.",

    "abstract": "Parenting has been extensively studied but mostly as a causal factor influencing child outcomes. The aim of the current article is to examine the child's side of the relationship by meta-analyzing studies which used quantitative genetic methods that provide leverage in understanding causality. A meta-analysis of 32 children-as-twins studies of parenting revealed a heritability estimate of 23%, thus indicating that genetically influenced behaviors of the child affect and shape parental behavior. The shared- and nonshared-environmental estimates, which amounted to 43% and 34%, respectively, indicate not only substantial consistency in parental behavior but also differential treatment within the family. Assessment method, age, and parenting dimension were found to be significant moderators of these influences. Our findings stress the importance of accounting for genotype-environment correlations in child-development studies and call into question previous research that interpreted correlational results in unidirectional terms with parenting as the sole causal factor.",

    "abstract": "Low birth weight and low 5-min Apgar scores have been associated with developmental delay, while older maternal age is a protective factor. Little is known about trajectories and predictors of developmental skills in infant twins, who are generally born with lower birth weights, lower Apgar scores and to older mothers.\nDevelopmental skills were assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months using the Ages and Stages Questionnaires in 152 twins from the Birmingham Registry for Twin and Heritability Studies. Multilevel spline and linear regression models (adjusted for gestational age, gender, maternal age) were used to estimate developmental trajectories and the associations between birth weight, maternal age and Apgar scores on developmental skills.\nTwins performed worse than singletons on communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving and personal-social skills (p < 0.001). Twins caught up around 6 months (score within -1 standard deviation of norm), except on gross motor skills, which did not catch up until after the age of 12 months. A one-year increase in maternal age was significantly associated with decreases in gross motor and personal-social z-scores of up to -0.09, whereas one unit increases in Apgar score increased z-scores up to 0.90 (p < 0.01).\nHealthy twins should be considered at a higher risk for developmental delay. Whether these results are comparable to preterm singletons, or whether there are twin-specific issues involved, should be further investigated in a study that uses a matched singleton control group.",

    "abstract": "Smaller studies and many case series reports indicate that congenital heart defects may be more common in monochorionic twins than in dichorionic twins and singletons.\nWe investigated congenital heart defect occurrence in all twins and 5% of all singletons born in Denmark in 1977-2001 and followed through 2006 by linking the Danish Twin Registry and Statistics Denmark registers including the National Medical Birth Register and the Danish National Patient Register. Among 41 525 twin individuals, a total of 584 twins (1.4%) had a congenital heart defect registered in the Danish National Patient Register, whereas the corresponding numbers for singletons were 648 of 74 473 (0.87%; P<0.001; ie, a 63% [95% confidence interval, 45-82%] increased risk for congenital heart defect for twins). Patent ductus arteriosus and coarctation of aorta occurred >3 times as often in twins as in singletons, at 3.9 (95% confidence interval, 2.6-5.8) and 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.5-6.4), respectively. The increased occurrence in twins was also found in sensitivity analyses including only inpatients or only surgically treated cases regardless of whether preterm patent ductus arteriosus was included. We were not able to demonstrate a higher risk for congenital heart defect among monozygotic twins compared with dizygotic twins, and the congenital heart defect occurrence was also increased in dizygotic twins, who are all dichorionic.\nCongenital heart defect is more common in twins than in singletons, and the increased occurrence is not restricted to monochorionic twins. Intrauterine surveillance and a postnatal comprehensive cardiac assessment for both twins may be considered regardless of chorionicity and zygosity.",

    "abstract": "Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of Langerhans cells accompanying eosinophils. It often attacks children under 10 years of age. LCH in identical twins is very rare and its prognosis is different. Here we report identical-twin sisters with LCH. Computed tomography (CT) revealed osteolytic change in each twin's skull, and the elder exhibited poor eyesight. There were massive histiocyte-like cells surrounded by eosinophils in pathologic specimen of the abnormal lesions, which is typical pathologic finding in LCH. These pathologic cells were positive for S-100 and the cell surface protein CD1 antigen (CD1\u03b1), the known markers of LCH. After treating them with surgery, no symptoms were seen in the younger until now. While the older was found another soft mass (about 2.0 cm in diameter) in the left temporal area 18 months later. The same treatment was given to the older after admission, and she is healthy to date. To explore the relationship between hallmarks and the prognosis of identical-twin patients with LCH, we retrieved the 16 literatures (16 identical-twin pairs, 31 patients) listed in PubMed during the past 60 years. The data revealed all those patients who have disseminated to the bone marrow, spleen and liver with symptoms of fever and hepatosplenomegaly exhibited worse prognosis (9 out of the 31 patients). The other identical-twin subjects without infiltration of those organs recovered well. In conclusion, this study reveals the adverse hallmarks of prognosis in identical-twin patients with LCH by reviewing relevant literatures.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify the specific components of facial aging secondary to smoking, by comparing standardized photographs of identical twins with different smoking histories.\nDuring the Twins Days Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, from 2007 to 2010, 79 pairs of twins were identified, in which only one twin smokes or where one twin smoked at least 5 years longer than his or her counterpart. Questionnaires were obtained and standardized photographs were taken by professional photographers. A panel of three blinded judges analyzed the twins' facial features and graded wrinkles using the validated Lemperle Assessment Scale, and ranked age-related facial features on a four-point scale.\nSmoking twins compared with their nonsmoking counterparts had worse scores for upper eyelid skin redundancy, lower lid bags, malar bags, nasolabial folds, upper lip wrinkles, lower lip vermillion wrinkles, and jowls. Lower lid hyperpigmentation in the smoking group fell just short of statistical significance. Transverse forehead wrinkles, glabellar wrinkles, crow's feet, and lower lip lines accentuated by puckering did not have a statistically significant differences in scores. Among twins with greater than 5 years' difference in smoking duration, twins who had smoked longer had worse scores for lower lid bags, malar bags, and lower lip vermillion wrinkles.\nThis study details the specifics of facial aging brought on by smoking, which primarily affects the middle and lower thirds of the face. It also demonstrates that a 5-year difference in smoking history can cause noticeable differences in facial aging in twins.\nRisk, II.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic events are crucial for early development, but can be influenced by environmental factors, potentially programming the genome for later adverse health outcomes. The insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)/H19 locus is crucial for prenatal growth and the epigenetic state at this locus is environmentally labile. Recent studies have implicated maternal factors, including folate intake and smoking, in the regulation of DNA methylation at this locus, although data are often conflicting in the direction and magnitude of effect. Most studies have focused on single tissues and on one or two differentially-methylated regions (DMRs) regulating IGF2/H19 expression. In this study, we investigated the relationship between multiple shared and non-shared gestational/maternal factors and DNA methylation at four IGF2/H19 DMRs in five newborn cell types from 67 pairs of monozygotic and 49 pairs of dizygotic twins. Data on maternal and non-shared supply line factors were collected during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and DNA methylation was measured via mass spectrometry using Sequenom MassArray EpiTyper analysis. Our exploratory approach showed that the site of umbilical cord insertion into the placenta in monochorionic twins has the strongest positive association with methylation in all IGF2/H19 DMRs (p<0.05). Further, evidence for tissue- and locus-specific effects were observed, emphasizing that responsiveness to environmental exposures in utero cannot be generalized across genes and tissues, potentially accounting for the lack of consistency in previous findings. Such complexity in responsiveness to environmental exposures in utero has implications for all epigenetic studies investigating the developmental origins of health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Classically derived estimates of heritability from twin models have been plagued by the possibility of genetic-environmental covariance. Survey questions that attempt to measure directly the extent to which more genetically similar kin (such as monozygotic twins) also share more similar environmental conditions represent poor attempts to gauge a complex underlying phenomenon of GE-covariance. The present study exploits a natural experiment to address this issue: Self-misperception of twin zygosity in the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Such twins were reared under one \"environmental regime of similarity\" while genetically belonging to another group, reversing the typical GE-covariance and allowing bounded estimates of heritability for a range of outcomes. In addition, we examine twins who were initially misclassified by survey assignment--a stricter standard--in three datasets: Add Health, the Minnesota Twin Family Study and the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden. Results are similar across approaches and datasets and largely support the validity of the equal environments assumption.",

    "abstract": "A paradigm shift from hard to flexible, organic-based optoelectronics requires fast and reversible mechanical response from actuating materials that are used for conversion of heat or light into mechanical motion. As the limits in the response times of polymer-based actuating materials are reached, which are inherent to the less-than-optimal coupling between the light/heat and mechanical energy in them, a conceptually new approach to mechanical actuation is required to leapfrog the performance of organic actuators. Herein, we explore single crystals of 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene (TBB) as actuating elements and establish relations between their kinematic profile and mechanical properties. Centimeter-size acicular crystals of TBB are the only naturally twinned crystals out of about a dozen known materials that exhibit the thermosalient effect-an extremely rare and visually impressive crystal locomotion. When taken over a phase transition, crystals of this material store mechanical strain and are rapidly self-actuated to sudden jumps to release the internal strain, leaping up to several centimeters. To establish the structural basis for this colossal crystal motility, we investigated the mechanical profile of the crystals from macroscale, in response to externally induced deformation under microscope, to nanoscale, by using nanoindentation. Kinematic analysis based on high-speed recordings of over 200 twinned TBB crystals exposed to directional or nondirectional heating unraveled that the crystal locomotion is a kinematically complex phenomenon that includes at least six kinematic effects. The nanoscale tests confirm the highly elastic nature, with an elastic deformation recovery (60%) that is far superior to those of molecular crystals reported earlier. This property appears to be critical for accumulation of stress required for crystal jumping. Twinned crystals of TBB exposed to moderate directional heating behave as all-organic analogue of a bimetallic strip, where the lattice misfit between the two crystal components drives reversible deformation of the crystal.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and health perception in adulthood, and to explore the contribution of shared familial factors to these associations. Data were collected from 180 female twins (90 pairs) from the community-based University of Washington Twin Registry. Participants completed questionnaires including the modified ACE Questionnaire, Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire, McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form, and the SF-36. Mixed effects linear regression modeling investigated the effects of ACE on indices of health perception controlling for correlated twin data. Additional models examined the associations while controlling for the experience of physical and/or sexual abuse in childhood; within-twin pair models that inherently adjust for familial factors explored shared familial influences. After controlling for relevant demographic variables, more ACE was associated with worse perceptions of general health (p=.01) and vitality (p=.05) on the SF-36. After controlling for childhood physical and/or sexual abuse, the relationship between ACE and general health remained significant (p=.01) while vitality was no longer significant. None of the associations remained significant after accounting for the influence of familial factors. These results support previous findings on the negative link between ACE and perceived health in adulthood. The detrimental effects of ACE on vitality may be accounted for by the experience of childhood physical and/or sexual abuse. Shared familial factors might play a partial role in the relationship between ACE and health perception. Future research should further investigate the genetic and environmental mechanisms that may explain this relationship.",

    "abstract": "Twins have inconsistently shown poorer outcomes than singletons. Although a high proportion of twins are born very preterm, data are sparse on the long-term outcomes in very preterm twins. The objective of this study was to compare mortality and neurodevelopmental outcomes of very preterm singletons and twins and to study outcomes in relation to factors specific to twins.\nBirth cohort study Etude Epidemiologique sur les Petits Ages Gestationnels (EPIPAGE).\nNine regions in France.\nAll very preterm live births occurring from 22 to 32 weeks of gestation in all maternity wards of nine French regions in 1997 (n=2773).\nNeurodevelopmental status, including cerebral palsy, and a cognitive assessment with the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, with scores on the Mental Processing Composite (MPC) scale, was available for 1732 and 1473 children at 5 years of age, respectively.\nAmong live births, twins had higher hospital mortality than singletons (adjusted (a)OR: 1.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.9)). Among survivors, there was no crude difference at 5 years between twins and singletons in the prevalence of cerebral palsy (8.0% vs 9.1%, respectively), MPC <70 (9.5% vs 11.1%) and mean MPC (94.6 vs 94.4). However, after adjustment for sex, gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction and social factors, twins were more likely to have lower MPC scores (mean difference: -2.4 (95% CI-4.8 to 0.01)). Live born twins had a higher risk of mortality when birth weight discordance was present (aOR:2.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.8)), but there were no differences in long-term outcomes.\nCompared with very preterm singletons, twins had higher mortality, no difference with respect to severe deficiencies, but slightly lower MPC scores at 5 years.",

    "abstract": "Prepubertal gynecomastia is characterized by the presence of palpable uni- or bilateral breast tissue in boys without other signs of sexual maturation. It may be the endocrine expression of rare syndromes such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of anastrozole and to describe an innovative surgical approach.\nThis report presents twins with PJS, bilateral prepubertal gynecomastia, and testicular multifocal calcifications. Both twins were treated with anastrozole for 2 years. After finishing treatment, both were followed before subcutaneous mastectomy was performed by the \"modified\" Webster technique.\nGrowth velocity decreased and gynecomastia diminished during anastrozole treatment. After discontinuation of therapy due to a sharp reduction in growth velocity, both twins showed regrowth of gynecomastia, with painful and strained breasts. A significant reduction in breast volume with glandular removal was achieved.\nThe findings of this study showed a multidisciplinary approach to prepubertal gynecomastia due to the synergy of pediatricians, radiologists, and plastic surgeons. The follow-up evaluation after the anastrozole treatment showed it to be an efficacious medical treatment, as an alternative to orchidectomy, to control the effects of circulating estrogens. Moreover, the results observed in the patients confirmed the validity and feasibility of the \"modified\" Webster technique in terms of aesthetic and functional results, patient satisfaction, and absence of complications.",

    "abstract": "To find the longitudinal genetic effects on mandibular position in mixed dentition.\nThe sample used in this study consisted of lateral cephalograms of eighty-nine pairs of female twins in Beijing. With a mixed longitudinal method, the effective twins were 183 pairs(monozygous 110 pairs and dizygous 73 ones). The genetic and environmental effects on mandibular position were analyzed by statistical methods in female twins from six to twelve years old.\nStatistical comparisons revealed significant (P<0.05) environmental effects on the angles(ArGo'Me, SArGo', SN-MP, FH-MP, PP-MP), the depths(L1, L2, L3), and the heights(H1, H3) of mandibular, whilst genetic effects on the angle(NSAr) and the heights(H1, H2, H3, H4)(P<0.05); and family inheritance effects can be founded in the angles(ArGo'Me, SN-MP, NSGn, SGn-FH)(P<0.05).\nThe effect of inheritance on mandibular position is strong, while environmental impact is relatively weak. Stronger genetic influence on heights is shown than that on depths. The environmental influence on depths and heights is different. Using Ba as a reference, the depth of the chin is the most subjective to environment change, then the mandibular angle, and the condyle is the least. Using N and S as references, the environmental influence on heights showed different order from the most to least changeable: The mandibular angle, the condyle and the chin. In later stage of our observation, the mandibular morphology and growth type might be family inherited. For environmental influences plays important roles on mandibular position, these findings can be used in orthodontic treatment planning.",

    "abstract": "Discordant chromosomal anomalies in monozygotic twins may be caused by various timing issues of erroneous mitosis and twinning events. Here, we report a prenatal diagnosis of heterokaryotypic monozygotic twins discordant for phenotype. In a 28-year-old woman, ultrasound examination performed at 26 weeks of gestation, detected intrauterine growth restriction and unilateral cleft lip and palate in twin B, whereas twin A had normal fluid, growth and anatomy. Molecular karyotyping in twin B identified a 18q21.2qter deletion, further confirmed by FISH analysis on amniocytes. Interestingly, in twin A, cytogenetic studies (FISH analysis and karyotype) on amniocytes were normal. Genotyping with microsatellite markers confirmed the monozygosity of the twins. At 32 weeks of gestation, selective termination of twin B was performed by umbilical cord coagulation and fetal blood samples were taken from the umbilical cord in both twins. FISH analyses detected mosaicism in both twins with 75% of cells being normal and 25% harboring the 18qter deletion. After genetic counseling, the parents elected to terminate the second twin at 36 weeks of gestation. In postmortem studies, FISH analyses revealed mosaicism on several tissues in both twins. Taking into account this observation, we discuss the difficulties of genetic counseling and management concerning heterokaryotypic monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "To estimate the risk of stillbirth in dichorionic and monochorionic twins compared with singletons, and to evaluate the relevant causes of stillbirth in each group.\nA retrospective cohort analysis of all pregnancies \u226522 weeks of gestation was performed at a tertiary care center from January 1995 to June 2011. The overall fetal survival and the prospective risk of stillbirth were compared in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins, dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twins, and singletons. Causes of stillbirth were classified using the ReCoDe classification and were compared among the three study groups.\nA total of 46,200 singletons, 462 MCDA twins and 1108 DCDA twins were included in the study. Both Kaplan-Meier analysis and prospective risk calculation showed that MCDA twins had the highest risk of stillbirth (OR ranging between 13.5 95% CI 8.7-20.7 at 22.0-24.6 weeks and 4.0 95% CI 1.1-13.1 at 31.0-33.6 weeks, compared to singletons), while singletons had the lowest. Main causes of stillbirth were major congenital malformations in singletons (25.1%) and in DCDA twins (75%), and twin-twin transfusion syndrome in MCDA twins (81.5%). When excluding fetuses affected by major congenital anomalies, MCDA twins (p<0.001) but not DCDA twins (p=0.2) remained at increased risk for stillbirth compared with singletons.\nThe risk of stillbirth is significantly higher both in MCDA and DCDA twins compared with singletons. Stillbirths are mainly due to twin-twin transfusion syndrome in MCDA twins and major congenital anomalies in DCDA twins. When major congenital anomalies are excluded, DCDA twins have a similar in utero mortality to singletons.",

Reconstruction of the resulting abdominal-wall defect was performed using a flap from the gluteal region and the proximal portion of the inferior limb of the parasite, which is demonstrated. In addition, a review of all previously published cases is presented, showing that overall positive results can be obtained in treating this condition and that the presence and degree of cardiac involvement have a major influence on the prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have shown a long-lasting higher mortality after hip fracture, but the reasons for the excess risk are not well understood. We aimed to determine whether a higher mortality after hip fracture exists when controlling for genetic constitution, shared environment, comorbidity, and lifestyle by use of a nationwide cohort study in hip fracture discordant monozygotic twins. All 286 identical Swedish twin pairs discordant for hip fracture (1972 to 2010) were identified. Comorbidity and lifestyle information was retrieved by registers and questionnaire information. We used intrapair Cox regression to compute multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for death. During follow-up, 143 twins with a hip fracture died (50%) compared with 101 twins (35%) without a hip fracture. Through the first year after hip fracture, the rate of death increased fourfold in women (HR\u2009=\u20093.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-10.40) and sevenfold in men (HR\u2009=\u20096.67; 95% CI 1.47-30.13). The increased rate in women only persisted during the first year after hip fracture (HR after 1 year\u2009=\u20090.99; 95% CI 0.66-1.50), whereas the corresponding HR in men was 2.58 (95% CI 1.02-6.62). The higher risk in men after the hip fracture event was successively attenuated during follow-up. After 5 years, the hazard ratio in men with a hip fracture was 1.19 (95% CI 0.29-4.90). On average, the hip fracture contributed to 0.9 years of life lost in women (95% CI 0.06-1.7) and 2.7 years in men (95% CI 1.7-3.7). The potential years of life lost associated with the hip fracture was especially pronounced in older men (>75 years), with an average loss of 47% (95% CI 31-61) of the expected remaining lifetime. We conclude that both women and men display a higher mortality after hip fracture independent of genes, comorbidity, and lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "Genetic mechanisms are already predominant during embryonic craniofacial morphogenesis, but environment is also thought to influence dentofacial morphology postnatally, particularly during facial growth. A better understanding of the relative effects of genes and environment on dentofacial and occlusal parameters should improve our knowledge on the etiology of orthodontic disorders and therefore also on the possibilities and limitations of the orthodontic treatment and treatment planning. The aim of the present study is to explore the genetic and environmental influence on craniofacial dimensions in a group of 19 pairs of twins using the twin study method. The twin study carried out here clearly indicates that craniofacial matrix is under substantial genetic control and the redirection of a basic growth pattern may be modified only within biological limits which are harmonious for the patient.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of a single course of antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) therapy on the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm twins according to the time interval between ACS administration and delivery.\nWe performed a retrospective cohort study of twins born between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation from November 1995 to May 2011. Subjects were grouped on the basis of the time interval between the first ACS dose and delivery: the ACS-to-delivery interval of less than 2 days (n = 166), 2-7 days (n = 114), and more than 7 days (n = 66). Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes of each group were compared with a control group of twins who were not exposed to ACS (n = 122). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between the ACS-to-delivery interval and the incidence of RDS after adjusting for potential confounding variables.\nCompared with the ACS nonexposure group, the incidence of RDS in the group with an ACS-to-delivery interval of less than 2 days was not significantly different (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.089; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.524-2.262; P = .819). RDS occurred significantly less frequently when the ACS-to-delivery interval was between 2 and 7 days (aOR, 0.419; 95% CI, 0.181-0.968; P = .042). However, there was no significant reduction in the incidence of RDS when the ACS-to-delivery interval exceeded 7 days (aOR, 2.205; 95% CI, 0.773-6.292; P = .139).\nIn twin pregnancies, a single course of ACS treatment was associated with a decreased rate of RDS only when the ACS-to-delivery interval was between 2 and 7 days.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is common during adolescence and young adulthood and is associated with poor quality of life, depression, and functional disability. Recognizing that chronic pain has significant consequences, it is important to identify modifiable health behaviors that may place young adults at risk for chronic pain. This study examines associations between chronic musculoskeletal pain and smoking in young adult twins (n = 1,588, ages 18-30) participating in a statewide twin registry. Twins completed questionnaires assessing smoking, mood (anxiety, depressive symptoms, and stress), and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Analyses examined associations between chronic pain and smoking, particularly the role of genetics/shared familial factors and psychological symptoms. As predicted, results revealed a near-2-fold increased risk for chronic musculoskeletal pain in twins who currently smoked compared to nonsmokers, even when accounting for psychological factors. Results of within-pair analyses were only minimally attenuated, suggesting that associations between smoking and chronic musculoskeletal pain are better accounted for by nonshared factors than by shared familial factors/genetic effects. Future twin research is needed to identify what nonshared factors (eg, attitudes, direct effects of smoking on pain) contribute to these associations to further understand comorbidity. Longitudinal studies and recruitment of participants prior to smoking initiation and chronic pain onset will better identify causal associations.\nThis article describes associations between musculoskeletal pain and smoking in young adult twins, taking into account psychological symptoms. Findings highlight the importance of nonshared factors in associations between pain and smoking and the need to explore the roles of lifestyle, individual attitudes, and direct effects of smoking on pain.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (identical) twins have been widely used in genetic studies to determine the relative contributions of heredity and the environment in human diseases. Discordance in disease manifestation between affected monozygotic twins has been attributed to either environmental factors or different patterns of X chromosome inactivation (XCI). However, recent studies have identified genetic and epigenetic differences between monozygotic twins, thereby challenging the accepted experimental model for distinguishing the effects of nature and nurture. Here, we report the genomic and epigenomic sequences in skin fibroblasts of a discordant monozygotic twin pair with Rett syndrome, an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by autistic features, epileptic seizures, gait ataxia and stereotypical hand movements. The twins shared the same de novo mutation in exon 4 of the MECP2 gene (G269AfsX288), which was paternal in origin and occurred during spermatogenesis. The XCI patterns in the twins did not differ in lymphocytes, skin fibroblasts, and hair cells (which originate from ectoderm as does neuronal tissue). No reproducible differences were detected between the twins in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels), or copy number variations. Differences in DNA methylation between the twins were detected in fibroblasts in the upstream regions of genes involved in brain function and skeletal tissues such as Mohawk Homeobox (MKX), Brain-type Creatine Kinase (CKB), and FYN Tyrosine Kinase Protooncogene (FYN). The level of methylation in these upstream regions was inversely correlated with the level of gene expression. Thus, differences in DNA methylation patterns likely underlie the discordance in Rett phenotypes between the twins.",

    "abstract": "DSM-IV specifies a hierarchal diagnostic structure such that an oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) diagnosis is applied only if criteria are not met for conduct disorder (CD). Genetic studies of ODD and CD support a combination of shared genetic and environmental influences but largely ignore the imposed diagnostic structure.\nWe examined whether ODD and CD share an underlying etiology while accounting for DSM-IV diagnostic specifications. Data from 1446 female twin pairs, aged 11-19 years, were fitted to two-stage models adhering to the DSM-IV diagnostic hierarchy.\nThe models suggested that DSM-IV ODD-CD covariation is attributed largely to shared genetic influences.\nThis is the first study, to our knowledge, to examine genetic and environmental overlap among these disorders while maintaining a DSM-IV hierarchical structure. The findings reflect primarily shared genetic influences and specific (i.e. uncorrelated) shared/familial environmental effects on these DSM-IV-defined behaviors. These results have implications for how best to define CD and ODD for future genetically informed analyses.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to singletons, twins born to older mothers have lower rates of perinatal mortality than twins born to younger mothers. We examined whether differences in chorionicity could explain this unexpected maternal age effect.\nWe used population-based data on twins born to mothers aged 20-29 (n\u00a0= 3702) and \u226535\u00a0years (n\u00a0= 1880) in the North of England, UK, 1998-2007. We calculated rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the effect of maternal age; adjusted RRs (ARRs) were estimated by the use of generalized estimating equations for Poisson regression controlling for chorionicity and other confounders.\nOlder mothers had a lower proportion of monochorionic twins (17.6% vs. 24.3%, P < .01); lower\u00a0neonatal (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.95) and perinatal mortality (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.53-1.04). Adjustment for chorionicity attenuated these associations (ARR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35-0.98 and ARR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.57-1.12, respectively) and after further adjustment for additional factors, both associations became nonsignificant. Older mothers had greater rates of small-for-gestational-age infants (ARR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.24-2.05), and cesarean delivery (ARR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.16-1.48).\nPerinatal death rates were lower but not statistically different for twins born to older versus younger mothers. This association was attenuated by adjustment for chorionicity.",

    "abstract": "Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a rare congenital defect of autosomal dominant inheritance, primarily affecting bones that undergo intra-membranous ossification. Herein is reported the case of monozygotic male 13-year-old twins with typical features of this syndrome, such as large wide-open fontanels, abnormal clavicles with narrow, sloping shoulders that can be apposed at the midline, short stature, mid-face hypoplasia, multiple supernumerary teeth, and skeletal anomalies. Their physical appearance led to the diagnosis of CCD. Genetic analysis found a C-T exchange in exon 2 at cDNA position 568, which changes the codon CGG for arginine to TGG for tryptophan (R190W) of the runt-related transcription factor 2 RUNX2 gene. CCD should be suspected in patients with persistence of the widely open anterior fontanels and sutures, short stature, and poor clavicles, calvarium, or teeth. Timely recognition and hereditary tendency counseling is required and useful because of the possibility of covert transmissibility and sporadic genetic mutation.",

    "abstract": "We report a monochorionic diamniotic twin pair born at 29 weeks of gestation in which both twins developed severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with retinal detachment. The pregnancy was terminated due to reversal of donor-recipient phenotypes in possible TTTS. Both twins had unstable cardiopulmonary status during the first week, and developed chronic lung disease. The larger twin, born at 1372 g, developed stage 4a ROP in both eyes, and the smaller twin, born at 1168 g, developed stage 4a ROP in the left eye. Genetic analysis of NDP, FZD4, LRP5, TSPAN12 genes revealed no mutations; however, VEGF gene polymorphism analysis showed heterozygous carrier state of the VEGF 936T allele in both twins, which is a risk factor for threshold ROP in Japanese newborn infants. We speculate the synergistic effects of unstable perinatal cardiopulmonary status and genetic predisposition due to VEGF 936C>T polymorphism caused the development of severe ROP with retinal detachment.",

Here we present a pair of dizygous, sex-discordant monochorionic twins who were conceived after artificial insemination. Histological examination of the placenta and extensive genetic studies of the healthy boy and girl clearly proved that they indeed were monochorionic dizygous twins with a fully joined blood circulation. We conclude that when counseling parents expecting monochorionic twins of discordant sex, not only a disorder of sexual differentiation in one of the twins should be addressed but also the possibility of dizygosity with a completely normal (sexual) development of both children.",

We constructed birth weight (BW), length (BL), and head circumference (BHC) references, assessed effects of twinness and parity, and defined cut-off points for small, appropriate, and large for gestational age.\nBirth register data of all 753,036 infants born in 1996-2008 in Finland were cleaned to create references reflecting optimal intrauterine growth. The final data included 533,666 singletons and 15,033 twins (median gestation weeks (gws) 40.0 and 37.1, respectively, 41.6% primiparous). Sex-specific BW, BL, and BHC references were constructed from 23 to 43 gws separately for singletons and twins born to primiparous or multiparous mothers. GAMLSS method was used for modelling.\nIn singletons from 36 gws onwards, increased BW and BL were observed in comparison to previous reference from 1979-1983. Twins diverged from singletons from 30 gws onwards. At 37.0 gws, mean BW was 400 g lower and mean BL 1.2 cm shorter than in singletons. From 30 gws onwards, birth size was larger in infants of multiparous than primiparous mothers.\nPopulation-based birth size references are available for the evaluation of birth size. Accounting for plurality and parity improves the accuracy of birth size evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a multifactorial disease. Twin studies comparing the disease concordance rate in identical twin pairs serve to differentiate the influence of genetic and environmental factors in the disease development.\nTo assess breast cancer risk for an identical twin sister of a patient with breast cancer.\nFive monozygotic twin families were examined during 2005-\u200a2011 in which at least one of the monozygotic sisters developed breast cancer.In 4 breast cancer women from 4 families, molecular genetic analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was performed.\nThe median followup period was 12.6 years (7 to 24 years). No pair of monozygotic sisters was concordant for breast cancer. Familial breast/\u200aovarian cancer syndrome due to BRCA1 gene mutation was confirmed in one pair. These twins were phenotypically discordant, the first one developing breast cancer at the age of 54 years, her co\u200asister suffering from ovarian cancer at the age of 43 years. In the other 4 nonBRCA families, breast cancer was diagnosed at the age of 38-\u200a50 years (median 44 years) in one of the sisters; the other twins remain healthy through the followup period.\nWe did not observe concordance for breast cancer in 5 pairs of monozygotic twins. Based on results of published studies, the life\u200a time breast cancer risk for a healthy identical twin of a breast cancer nonBRCA woman is around 20-\u200a30 %. Other nonhereditary risk factors must exist to explain the discordant phenotype. This highlights that environmental factors play an important role in breast cancer development. In case of BRCA associated breast cancer, breast cancer risk for the healthy co\u200atwin is the same as that for other BRCA mutation carriers, i.e. 45-\u200a85%.",

    "abstract": "This is the first report in the literature of a sole regional anesthetic for adult craniopagus twins using a supraclavicular block for an elbow incision and drainage/bursa excision procedure. It demonstrates that for these complex medical patients, a total regional anesthesia technique is preferable when possible. There are several known general anesthetic complications in these patients. Anesthetic crossover between the twins can occur and may be variable; furthermore, the incidence and severity of the crossover effects of different anesthetics vary. Positioning of the twins can be difficult with both regional and general anesthesia. However, with regional anesthesia, the twins can position themselves and report any discomfort, which could go unnoticed under general anesthesia, leading to other complications. Craniopagus twins have a high likelihood of a difficult airway due to anatomy or positioning difficulties, which is avoided by regional anesthesia. This case emphasizes the unique challenges that these patients pose and the ability of regional anesthesia to help avoid the pitfalls of general anesthesia in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) affects 15% of monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twin pregnancies, and is associated with adverse perinatal outcome. Recently, fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (FLP) has been widely accepted as the most definitive therapy to treat TTTS. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a powerful diagnostic marker of cardiac dysfunction in neonates, and is elevated in MD twins with TTTS. However, there are no reports assessing the effect of FLP on neonatal cardiac overload in TTTS by measuring the serum NT-proBNP levels at birth. Here, we aimed to compare serum NT-proBNP levels at birth in MD twins with TTTS treated with FLP or not. Twelve MD twin pairs with TTTS admitted to our center between October 2007 and September 2012 were enrolled in this study. The MD twin pairs were separated into two groups: seven twins (12 newborn infants) with FLP (FLP group) and five twins (nine newborn infants) without FLP (non-FLP group). Gestational age, birthweight, and Apgar scores were significantly higher in the FLP group than that in the non-FLP group. Serum NT-proBNP levels at birth were significantly lower in the FLP group than in the non-FLP group [1425 pg/ml (range, 466-9560) vs. 29900 pg/ml (range, 7300-77900), respectively; p=0.0003]. The serum NT-proBNP levels of larger and smaller co-twins were significantly correlated with each other (r=0.750; p=0.026). In conclusion, serum NT-proBNP levels at birth are lower in MD twins with TTTS after FLP treatment than in those without FLP.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) has focused on the influence of genetic variation and environmental risk factors. Growing evidence suggests the additional role of epigenetic mechanisms influencing susceptibility for complex traits. DNA sequence within discordant monozygotic twin (MZT) pairs is virtually identical; thus, they represent a powerful design for studying the contribution of epigenetic factors to disease liability. The aim of this study was to investigate whether specific methylation profiles in white blood cells could contribute to the aetiology of MDD. Participants were drawn from the Queensland Twin Registry and comprised 12 MZT pairs discordant for MDD and 12 MZT pairs concordant for no MDD and low neuroticism. Bisulphite treatment and genome-wide interrogation of differentially methylated CpG sites using the Illumina Human Methylation 450 BeadChip were performed in WBC-derived DNA. No overall difference in mean global methylation between cases and their unaffected co-twins was found; however, the differences in females was significant (P=0.005). The difference in variance across all probes between affected and unaffected twins was highly significant (P<2.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076), with 52.4% of probes having higher variance in cases (binomial P-value<2.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076). No significant differences in methylation were observed between discordant MZT pairs and their matched concordant MZT (permutation minimum P=0.11) at any individual probe. Larger samples are likely to be needed to identify true associations between methylation differences at specific CpG sites.",

    "abstract": "To study the clinical and genetic characteristics of twins and siblings affected with Wilson's disease (WD).\nClinical data and blood samples were collected from the subjects after informed consent was obtained. Genomic DNA was extracted and potential mutations in the exons in ATP7B gene were detected with PCR-DNA sequencing. Short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping was performed to determine the zygosity of the twins.\nThe 5 pairs of twins have all met the diagnostic criteria for WD. STR genotyping has confirmed that 4 pairs were monozygotic twins. 3 pairs of twins had an onset with liver symptoms, the other 2 had an onset with brain symptoms. ATP7B gene mutations were detected in 4 pairs of twins, which have all located in exons 8 and 13. A heterozygous p.R778W mutation in exon 8 and homozygous p.P992L mutation in exon 13 were detected in all patients from one family, whose parents have carried a heterozygous p.R778W mutation and p.P992L heterozygous mutation, respectively, which suggested loss of heterozygosity (LOH). In one family, no mutation was detected in all exons of the ATP7B gene in the patients and their parents. For a triplet, one female was with definite WD and brain symptoms at the onset, one male had subclinical type with WD, whilst another female was completely normal. The triplets and their mother have all carried a p.P992L heterozygous mutation .\nAbove results have confirmed an important role for genetic factors in the pathogenesis of WD. In addition to point mutations, LOH is also involved in the pathogenesis for WD.",

ATP7B gene mutations were detected in 4 pairs of twins, which have all located in exons 8 and 13. A heterozygous p.R778W mutation in exon 8 and homozygous p.P992L mutation in exon 13 were detected in all patients from one family, whose parents have carried a heterozygous p.R778W mutation and p.P992L heterozygous mutation, respectively, which suggested loss of heterozygosity (LOH). In one family, no mutation was detected in all exons of the ATP7B gene in the patients and their parents. For a triplet, one female was with definite WD and brain symptoms at the onset, one male had subclinical type with WD, whilst another female was completely normal. The triplets and their mother have all carried a p.P992L heterozygous mutation .",

    "abstract": "Although exclusion from the workforce due to long-term sick leave (LTSL) and disability pension (DP) is a major problem in many Western countries, the etiology of LTSL and DP is not well understood. These phenomena have a strong association as most patients receiving DP have first been on LTSL. However, only a few of those on LTSL end up with DP. The present study aimed to investigate the common and specific genetic and environmental risk factors for LTSL and DP. The present study utilizes a population-based sample of 7,710 young adult twins from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health Twin Panel, which has been linked to the Historical-Event Database (FD-Trygd; 1998-2008). Univariate and bivariate twin models were fitted to determine to what degree genetic and environmental factors contribute to variation in LTSL and DP. The estimated heritabilities of LTSL and DP were 0.49 and 0.66, respectively. There was no evidence for shared environmental or sex-specific factors. The phenotypic-, genetic-, and non-familial environmental correlations between the variables were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.94, respectively. Our results indicate that familial transmission of LTSL and DP is due to genetic and not environmental factors. The risk factors contributing to LTSL and DP were mainly shared, suggesting that what increases risk for LTSL also increases risk for DP. However, a non-negligible part of the genetic variance was not shared between the variables, which may contribute to explaining why some progress from LTSL to DP, whereas others return to work.",

    "abstract": "Impaired sleep patterns are known to be associated with many chronic conditions and ultimately they may lead to permanent work incapacity. Less is known about the associations between sleep patterns and cause-specific disability pensions, such as low back diagnoses, or whether familial factors (genetics and family environment) can affect the associations. The objective of this study was to investigate sleep patterns as predictors of disability pension due to low back diagnoses with a 23-year follow-up.\nA prospective cohort study with comprehensive mailed questionnaires about sleep patterns, e.g., quality and length of sleep in 1975 and 1981. Follow-up from the national disability pension register data until 2004.\nNot applicable.\nThere were 18,979 individuals (7,722 complete twin pairs) born before 1958.\nCox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Disability pension due to low back diagnoses had been granted to 467 individuals during the follow-up. Sleeping moderately well (HR 1.25; 95% CI 1.02, 1.53), or fairly poorly/poorly (HR 2.05; 95% CI 1.53, 2.73) at baseline predicted a significantly higher risk for disability pension. Stable patterns of sleeping either fairly well (HR 1.29; 95% CI 1.01, 1.64), or stably fairly poorly/poorly (HR 2.29; 95% CI 1.49, 3.52) between 1975 and 1981 were associated with a higher risk as compared to a stable pattern of sleeping well. Furthermore, a decrease in quality of sleep from 1975 to 1981 was associated (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.03, 1.76) with an increased risk of disability pension.\nSleep quality and changes in sleep quality appear to be early predictors for disability pension due to low back diagnoses independently from other confounding factors.",

    "abstract": "We present a case of hematopoietic chimerism in dizygotic twins (male and female) conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF). At 8 years of age a blood karyotype was performed on the female due to the presence of clitoromegaly. Two different lines: 46,XX (53%) and 46,XY (47%) were found. FISH studies confirmed the presence of the SRY gene in 46,XY cells. Karyotyping of the male showed two different lines: 46,XY (58%) and 46,XX (42%). SRY gene was present in 46,XY cells. Microsatellite analyses of blood DNA revealed tetra-allelic contribution at some autosomal loci with similar proportions of maternal and paternal alleles and X/Y chromosome dose. FISH in buccal mucous showed that all cells from the female were 46,XX and those from the male 46,XY. The gonadal karyotype in the female was 46,XX without SRY. Hence, we report 46,XX/46,XY chimerism in dizygotic twins. Blood chimerism was confirmed by performing FISH on the buccal cells of the patients.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are generally considered to be distinct illnesses. One piece of evidence supporting their distinctness is the rarity of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder occurring in monozygotic co\u2012twins.\nWe describe a well-characterized pair of African American, female, monozygotic twins assessed at 53 years of age.Case 1: Twin A developed psychotic symptoms at age 23. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with schizophrenia. Twin A was subsequently hospitalized several more times and was consistently diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. At the time of assessment, Twin A was single, lived with her parents and attended a day program. Case 2: In contrast, Twin B worked in a professional career, married and raised a family. She remained well until age 48 when she developed a depressive disorder requiring medication treatment. Four years later, Twin B abruptly developed grandiose delusions and mood-congruent auditory hallucinations. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with a manic episode. Since then Twin B has remained symptom-free on the mood stabilizer sodium valproate.\nSchizophrenia and bipolar disorder can occur in identical co-twins. We speculate on what it tells us about the meaning of discordance and the putative role of de novo mutations.",

    "abstract": "Differences in lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and peristaltic function and in transient LES relaxations (TLESR) have been described in patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, some of these differences may be the result of chronic GERD rather than being an underlying contributory factor.\nTwins discordant for GERD symptoms, i.e., only one twin had GERD symptoms, underwent standard LES and esophageal body manometry, and then using a sleeve sensor prolonged LES and pH monitoring, 30 min before and 60 min after a 250 mL 1200 kcal lipid meal.\nEight monozygotic and 24 dizygotic female twins were studied. Although there was no difference in preprandial LES pressure (symptomatic 13.2 \u00b1 7.1 mmHg vs asymptomatic 15.1 \u00b1 6.2 mmHg, P = 0.4), LES pressure fell further postprandially in symptomatic twins (LES pressure area under the curve 465 \u00b1 126 vs 331 \u00b1 141 mmHg h, P < 0.01). 12/37 (32%) of acid reflux episodes in symptomatic twins occurred due to low LES pressure or deep inspiration/strain and 0/17 in asymptomatic twins (P = 0.01). There was no difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic twins in: peristaltic amplitude, ineffective esophageal body motility, hiatus hernia prevalence, or LES length. There was also no difference in TLESR frequency preprandially (symptomatic median 1(range 0-2) vs asymptomatic 0(0-2), P = 0.08) or postprandially (2.5(1-8) vs 3(1-6), P = 0.81).\nTwins with GERD symptoms had lower postprandial LES pressure and given the close genetic link between the twins, it is possible that such differences are caused by GERD. Acid reflux episodes associated with a hypotensive LES were seen in symptomatic, but not in asymptomatic twins.",

    "abstract": "Low birth weight is associated with an increased adult metabolic disease risk. It is widely discussed that poor intra-uterine conditions could induce long-lasting epigenetic modifications, leading to systemic changes in regulation of metabolic genes. To address this, we acquire genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from saliva DNA in a unique cohort of 17 monozygotic monochorionic female twins very discordant for birth weight. We examine if adverse prenatal growth conditions experienced by the smaller co-twins lead to long-lasting DNA methylation changes.\nOverall, co-twins show very similar genome-wide DNA methylation profiles. Since observed differences are almost exclusively caused by variable cellular composition, an original marker-based adjustment strategy was developed to eliminate such variation at affected CpGs. Among adjusted and unchanged CpGs 3,153 are differentially methylated between the heavy and light co-twins at nominal significance, of which 45 show sensible absolute mean \u03b2-value differences. Deep bisulfite sequencing of eight such loci reveals that differences remain in the range of technical variation, arguing against a reproducible biological effect. Analysis of methylation in repetitive elements using methylation-dependent primer extension assays also indicates no significant intra-pair differences.\nSevere intra-uterine growth differences observed within these monozygotic twins are not associated with long-lasting DNA methylation differences in cells composing saliva, detectable with up-to-date technologies. Additionally, our results indicate that uneven cell type composition can lead to spurious results and should be addressed in epigenomic studies.",
