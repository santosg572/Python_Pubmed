    "abstract": "Two recent reports on recurrent cases of umbilical cord stricture (UCS) have opened the debate on the possibility of a genetic basis for this anomaly, traditionally considered to be sporadic. We present a series of 130 cases of UCS located at the fetal insertion, diagnosed among 2067 fetal and infantile autopsies performed during the last 10 years. All cases were macerated stillborn fetuses, and 54.6% were < or =20 weeks of gestational age. Our study is focused on 2 recurrent episodes and 16 cases occurring in multiple pregnancies. Among twins, males were affected more than females (2.2:1), although no statistical significance was found. Associated umbilical cord anomalies were present in 8 of 16 cases, consisting of hypocoiling (3 cases), hypercoiling (2 cases), excessive length (1 case), vascular tortuosity (1 case), and single umbilical artery (1 case). The most frequent placental finding was obliterative endovasculopathy (6 cases), probably indicating a causal relationship with UCS. Zygosity was analyzed by placental histology and/or a panel of 12 microsatellite markers to classify twins as monozygotic (8 cases) or dizygotic (8 cases). Our data prove that UCS is not a genetic condition because all 8 genetically identical twins were discordant for the anomaly and 2 dizygotic twins with UCS had co-twins also affected. Genetic factors are not implicated in UCS pathophysiology, and parents with a fetal demise due to UCS should be counseled as having a low-recurrence risk for subsequent pregnancies. Because there is not a higher incidence of UCS in multiple gestations, twinning should not be considered a risk factor for UCS.",

    "abstract": "Multiple pregnancies in assisted reproduction can be regarded as iatrogenic and avoidable, given that the phenomenon is related to the number of embryos replaced. Prospective studies have shown that transferring one fresh embryo and subsequently one frozen embryo gives similar cumulative pregnancy rates to transferring two fresh embryos. However, the multiple pregnancy rates differ significantly between the two strategies. In Trondheim, elective double embryo transfer (eDET) was introduced in September 1991. Prior to that, multiple pregnancy rates were nearly 35% and the triplet rate was 7%. The triplet rate dropped to below 1%, but the twin rate still remained high. In 2002, it was decided to start elective single embryo transfer (eSET) and currently SET is performed in more than 90% of in-vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. The inclusion criteria are nearly as simple as: 'If you have two good embryos, you get only one embryo at a time'. Multiple pregnancy rates are well below 10% and there are no triplets. In conclusion, triplet rates can be reduced to zero and twin rates to below 10% by eSET. The cumulative pregnancy rate per oocyte recovery is not reduced, including replacement of frozen- thawed embryos.",

    "abstract": "BMI is highly heritable. Yet, trends in obesity highlight environmental influences on body weight. Monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for overweight offer a unique opportunity to examine these factors.\nMZ male (n=8 pairs) and female twins (n=10 pairs) discordant for overweight (defined as the BMI of one twin being at least 24.5, and the BMI of his/her co-twin being below 24.5 and at least three points lower) were identified from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry. Variables were assessed via self-report questionnaires.\nOne overweight and two non-overweight females met criteria for bulimia nervosa. Rates of dieting and binge eating were high among all males and females. Hunger scores were higher among non-overweight females; disinhibition scores were higher among overweight males. Only one non-overweight and three overweight males smoked; 90% of non-overweight and 40% of overweight females smoked.\nAssessing tobacco use and eating disorders may be important when sampling on the basis of family members who are discordant for BMI. Finally, results suggest possibilities for interventions in individuals at-risk for overweight.",

    "abstract": "This longitudinal study examined the contribution of infants' temperament, mother's attachment style, and perceived grandmother's support following delivery, to the psychological mental health and marital adaptation of first time and non-first time Israeli mothers of pre-term (n = 70) and full-term (n = 78) twins, a year later. We collected data for the current study over 2 years (2003-2004). The findings suggested that the extent of mothers' personal and familial stress and their internal resource of attachment style played a crucial role in their mental health and marital adaptation. The external resource of grandmother's support contributed directly to the mothers' marital adaptation, whereas it contributed to their mental health only when infant's temperament was perceived to be difficult. Interestingly, the association between stress and adaptation was stronger among mothers of full-term twins than mothers of pre-term twins. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Menarche is a significant developmental event in the lives of young females. Genetic and family environmental influences on the timing of its occurrence are explored in the first formal analysis using reared-apart and reared-together monozygotic (MZA, MZT) and dizygotic (DZA, DZT) twin pairs. Mean age at menarche was 12.50 years (SD = 1.67) for the reared-apart pairs and 12.86 years (SD = 1.49) for the reared-together pairs. Intraclass correlations for age at menarche were 0.56 for MZA twins, 0.16 for DZA twins, 0.70 for MZT twins, and 0.41 for DZT twins. The mean within-pair difference was 1.07 years (SD = 1.04) for MZA twins, 1.67 years (SD = 1.59) for DZA twins, 0.64 year (SD = 0.86) for MZT twins, and 1.43 years (SD = 1.34) for DZT twins. These results are consistent with genetic influence, although the lower correlations for reared-apart twins and their larger within-pair differences suggest that age at menarche is partly affected by common rearing environments. Feeling understood by one's father during the growing-up years was significantly associated with earlier age at menarche, and a comparable trend was found for feeling understood by one's mother. These findings are considered with reference to current theories of pubertal timing.",

The cause of gastroschisis is unknown, but most authors consider it exogenous. We describe the case of a woman with a twin pregnancy in which both twins had gastroschisis.\nA 17-year-old primiparous female was referred to our institution because of a twin pregnancy, with one twin diagnosed with gastroschisis at 34 weeks of gestation. Unfortunately, gastroschisis was noted in both twins, but no other anomalies were observed under level II sonographic evaluation. The twins were delivered by cesarean section at 36+ weeks of gestation because of preterm labor and breech presentation of one fetus. Both twins presented with a 3-cm abdominal wall defect located to the right side of the umbilicus and a large portion of the bowel protruding that was not covered by membrane. Histopathology of the placenta revealed that the twins were diamniotic monochorionic. Chromosomal analysis of cord blood showed normal karyotype (46,XX) in both newborns.\nThe cause of gastroschisis is unknown, although possible exogenous causes have been studied. The diagnosis of gastroschisis in twin pregnancy is always in late gestation. Therefore, maternal serum alpha fetoprotein screening and a detailed prenatal ultrasound evaluation are recommended in multifetal pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "There are no data on whether parents of twins will disclose mode of conception to researchers or to their children, who will be informants in adulthood. We sent 1600 questionnaires about this via the Victorian branch of the Australian Multiple Birth Association, to be returned anonymously. Parents were asked how their twins were conceived and whether those who used assisted conception would disclose this to researchers studying assisted conception, twin pregnancy or twin children, or to their children. Comments were invited. Altogether 975 (61%) questionnaires were returned and 389 (40%) indicated use of some form of assisted conception: 75 (19%) ovarian stimulation alone, 165 (42%) In Vitro Fertilisation, 132 (34%) Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection, and 17 (4%) Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer, with 20 reporting use of donor eggs and thirteen donor sperm. Of those using assisted conception, the proportion reporting that they would not, or may not, tell researchers was 5% for assisted conception studies, 6% for twin pregnancy studies, and 7% for studies of twin children, while 7% reported that they would not, or may not, tell their children. From the comments (from 374/975; 38%) it was clear that questions about mode of conception can be offensive to some parents of twins, unless there is a need to know. Further, the question 'are your twins natural?' should be avoided. We believe the question 'Did you need medical help to conceive your twins', followed up with specific questions, is more acceptable.",

    "abstract": "The equal environments assumption, which holds that trait-relevant environments are equally correlated among monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, is essential to twin designs. Violations of this assumption could lead to biased parameter estimates in twin models. A variety of methods and measures have been used to test this assumption. No studies to date have evaluated the measurement invariance of such items or examined the distribution of the underlying equal environments trait. The current study was an investigation of the psychometric properties of a self-report measure of twins' equal environments. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis results indicated that items loaded onto 'child' and 'teen' equal environments factors. Factor loadings and factor variances and their covariance were invariant for MZ and DZ twins; however, DZ twins had significantly lower factor means than MZ twins. Further, these items demonstrated adequate test-retest reliability. Lastly, the child and teen factors may be bimodally distributed, particularly for MZ twin pairs. Measurement invariance issues, as well as distributions of equal environments traits, should be considered when evaluating the equal environments assumption, in order to produce accurate parameter estimates in twin models.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability of obtaining through mailed surveys maternal reports of specific major motor milestones achievement. To accomplish this aim we compared and contrasted mailed survey data and telephone interview data on a series of questions about age at which motor milestones were achieved. We used monthly telephone interviews with mothers of 238 twin pairs, beginning at age 6 months, which ascertained the age at which each specific milestone was met. The contrasting 'through the mail' survey was sent after the second birthday of an independent group of children, and included 463 twin pairs. All twins were born between March 2003 and March 2004. Comparisons were made for the following 5 milestones: sitting without support, hands and knees crawling, turning from back to belly, standing without support, and walking without support. There was no difference between the concurrent telephone interviews and the retrospective through the mail survey on any of the landmarks, except 'standing without support'. From this work we conclude that data on achieving milestones can be reliably obtained through the mail using retrospective surveys when the children are 2 years of age.",

    "abstract": "Oral microbes that colonize in the mouths of humans contribute to disease susceptibility, but it is unclear if host genetic factors mediate colonization. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the levels at which oral microbes colonize in the mouth are heritable. Dental plaque biofilms were sampled from intact tooth surfaces of 118 caries-free twins. An additional 86 caries-active twins were sampled for plaque from carious lesions and intact tooth surfaces. Using a reverse capture checkerboard assay the relative abundance of 82 bacterial species was determined. An integrative computational predictive model determined microbial abundance patterns of microbial species in caries-free twins as compared to caries-active twins. Heritability estimates were calculated for the relative microbial abundance levels of the microbial species in both groups. The levels of 10 species were significantly different in healthy individuals than in caries-active individuals, including, A. defectiva, S. parasanguinis, S. mitis/oralis, S. sanguinis, S. cristatus, S. salivarius, Streptococcus sp. clone CH016, G. morbillorum and G. haemolysans. Moderate to high heritability estimates were found for these species (h(2) = 56%-80%, p < .0001). Similarity of the overall oral microbial flora was also evident in caries-free twins from multivariate distance matrix regression analysis. It appears that genetic and/or familial factors significantly contribute to the colonization of oral beneficial species in twins.",

    "abstract": "Genetically informative data can be used to address fundamental questions concerning the measurement of behavior in children. The authors illustrate this with longitudinal multiple-rater data on internalizing problems in twins. Valid information on the behavior of a child is obtained for behavior that multiple raters agree upon and for rater-specific perception of the child's behavior. Rater-disagreement variance varsigma2(rd) accounted for 35% of the individual differences in internalizing behavior. Up to 17% of this varsigma2(rd) was accounted for by rater-specific additive genetic variance varsigma2(Au). Thus, the disagreement should not be considered only to be bias/error but also as representing the unique feature of the relationships between that parent and the child. The longitudinal extension of this model helps to make a distinction between measurement error and the raters' unique perception of the child's behavior. For internalizing behavior, the results show large stability across time, which is accounted for by common additive genetic and common shared environmental factors. Rater-specific shared environmental factors show substantial influence on stability. This could mean that rater bias may be persistent and affect longitudinal studies.",

    "abstract": "Platelet-type von Willebrand disease (PT-VWD, or pseudo-VWD) and type 2B VWD share a common bleeding phenotype with different etiologies. Both PT-VWD and type 2B VWD represent an enhanced binding between the plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) to its platelet ligand, glycoprotein Ib alpha ( GP1BA). However, type 2B VWD results from a functionally abnormal VWF molecule, whereas PT-VWD is caused by hyperresponsive platelets due to defects in the platelet GP1BA gene. The laboratory discrimination between the two disorders can be a challenge because simple phenotypic testing will not differentially identify the disorders, and the more complex testing approaches are often poorly applied. Definitive diagnosis is critical for treatment decisions and can be most definitively achieved by identifying the gene defect at either the VWF or GP1BA loci. A systematic international molecular genetic study would be helpful to address the question of whether PT-VWD is being misdiagnosed as type 2B VWD. Such a study can be facilitated by an international online database/disease registry to enhance international awareness about this otherwise long-recognized diagnostic dilemma.",

Poor stereoacuity on Titmus stereo test circles was associated with late age of first crawling (RR=1.23 (1.06, 1.42) p=0.005 per month) and late age of first walking (RR 1.18 (1.05, 1.22) p=0.001 per month).",

    "abstract": "We report on monozygotic twins with neonatal onset of daily reflex seizures triggered by hot water. Video record during the hot water bathing showed clinical signs consistent with a reflex seizure. The numbers of episodes were markedly reduced when the mother began bathing the children with reduced temperature bath water. At the age of 20 months, the twins developed episodes of paroxysmal disturbances including alternating hemiplegia. These two patients are the youngest reported cases of reflex hot water seizures, and the only reported cases in which reflex hot water seizures subsequently manifested episodes of alternating hemiplegia.",

    "abstract": "Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we estimated neural activity in twins to study genetic influences on the cortical response to categories of visual stimuli (faces, places, and pseudowords) that are known to elicit distinct patterns of activity in ventral visual cortex. The neural activity patterns in monozygotic twins were significantly more similar than in dizygotic twins for the face and place stimuli, but there was no effect of zygosity for pseudowords (or chairs, a control category). These results demonstrate that genetics play a significant role in determining the cortical response to faces and places, but play a significantly smaller role (if any) in the response to orthographic stimuli.",

    "abstract": "The model of monozygotic twins has been repeatedly studied to control the genetic and age-specific effects on HIV disease. Focusing on this natural model, the expression of CD27/CD45RA differentiation markers and the distribution of the Vbeta TCR repertoire was analyzed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In our HIV-discordant monozygotic twins, a significant reduction of naive T cells and a parallel accumulation of effector/memory T cells was induced by HIV infection, as well as a skewing of T cell repertoire evidenced by VbetaTCR analysis. The block of HIV replication by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) restored most of the T cell maturation and selection process, with some exception among CTL differentiation and repertoire. Altogether, the model of HIV-discordant monozygotic twins is a valuable tool showing that HAART is not able to completely restore the CTL profile.",

However, the twins differed markedly in regard to smoking history; the twin with an approximately 52.5-pack-year smoking history showed more severe skin aging than did the nonsmoking twin.\nThe difference in skin aging illustrated by this twin pair may serve as a motivator for smoking cessation.",

Logistic regression was applied to determine the impact of a number of variables on mortality among MB in the first year of life. MB averaged 2% of all live births, but contributed 10% to all infant deaths. Infant mortality among MB was more than five times higher than among singletons. Mortality among MB declined by 27% in 1975-2002, considerably less than the 51% mortality decline among singletons in the same period. Infant mortality among twins and triplets was particularly high among children who were born to young mothers (<20 years), who were the first live birth, who were born after a short birth interval (<24 months) and whose mothers were unschooled. Mortality of MB was lower in the area with easy access to high-quality maternal and child-care services. Thus, good maternity and newborn care will improve the survival of MB.",

    "abstract": "Acardiac twinning is a severe and rare complication of monochorionic placentation. The acardiac twin does not survive while mortality of the normal twin is about 50-70% as the normal twin has to provide circulation not only for itself but also for acardiac twin. Proper timing of the delivery is of prime importance to the survival of the normal fetus for which emphasis is placed on close sonographic monitoring for early antenatal diagnosis. This series describes three such cases, which are now termed Twin Reversed Arterial Perfusion (TRAP) sequence.",

    "abstract": "Preterm labor (PTL) in a multiple gestation occurs frequently and is a common reason for preterm delivery (PTD). Management strategies for multiple gestations must be directed at early detection of PTL and effective strategies to delay or prevent PTD. Unlike singleton gestation where identification of patients at risk for PTL is often difficult, every multiple gestation is at risk for PTL, so all patients can be managed as being at risk. Although PTL is a significant cause of PTD, one must recognize that there are other reasons for delivery in multiple gestations. Clinicians must treat the whole patient and extend the pregnancy to the most advanced gestational age possible that is consistent with the best outcome.",

    "abstract": "Various studies have demonstrated an increased risk for adult diseases in newborns born small-for-gestational-age (SGA). Adiponectin and resistin can be detected in cord blood and are suggested to affect insulin resistance (IR). This might represent a link between metabolic syndrome and SGA birth.\nWe investigated the relationship between the adipocytokines and inter-twin birth weight (BW) difference of 31 monozygotic twins with twin-twin transfusion syndrome; in 14 twin pairs BW difference was >15% (1 SGA twin, 1 appropriate-for-gestational-age, AGA, twin).\nBW and length of all patients were positively related to adiponectin (r = 0.57; p < 0.0001; r = 0.47; p < 0.0001) and to resistin (r = 0.31; p < 0.01; r = 0.35; p < 0.01). In 71% (10/14), the SGA twins showed lower adiponectin concentrations than their AGA co-twins (only 6/14 for resistin). To correct for gestational age we calculated the relationship between the intrapair differences (Delta) of BW and Delta of the hormones. We found Delta BW positively correlated with adiponectin (r = 0.55; p < 0.001) but not with resistin (r = 0.22; p = 0.2). Delta adiponectin was positively correlated with Delta resistin (r = 0.45; p < 0.01).\nThese data demonstrate that adiponectin and resistin levels are associated with BW with only adiponectin levels being reduced in SGA children independently of gestational age. Prenatally different metabolic status between the twins might predispose the SGA twin to develop IR later in life.",

    "abstract": "Differentiation of testicular tissue in 46,XX individuals is seen either in XX males, the majority of them with SRY gene, or in individuals, usually SRY(-), with ovotesticular disorder of sex development (OT-DSD). Although they are sporadic cases, there are some reports on familial recurrence, including coexistence of XX maleness and OT-DSD in the same family.\nWe report on a case of SRY(-) 46,XX monozygotic twins with genital ambiguity.\nHormonal evaluation included testosterone, FSH, and LH measurements. SRY gene was investigated by PCR and two-step PCR in peripheral leukocytes and gonadal tissues, respectively. Direct DNA sequencing of the DAX-1 coding sequence was performed. Real-time PCR for SOX9 region on chromosome 17 was obtained.\nBoth twins had a 46,XX karyotype. Twin A had a 1-cm phallus with chordee, penoscrotal hypospadias, and palpable gonads. Serum levels of FSH (2.34 mIU/ml), LH (8.8 mIU/ml), and testosterone (1.6 ng/ml) were normal, and biopsies revealed bilateral testes. Twin B had a 0.5-cm phallus, perineal hypospadias, no palpable gonad on the right, and a left inguinal hernia. Hormonal evaluation revealed high FSH (8.2 mIU/ml) and LH (15 mIU/ml) and low testosterone (0.12 ng/ml). Upon herniotomy, a right testis (crossed ectopia) and a small left ovotestis were found. SRY gene was absent in both peripheral leukocytes and gonadal tissue samples. Neither DAX-1 mutations nor SOX9 duplication was identified.\nThis case provides evidence that both XX maleness and XX OT-DSD are different manifestations of the same disorder of gonadal development.",

    "abstract": "We report the first observation to our knowledge of mirror unilateral keratoconus in monozygotic twins. The observation focuses on monozygotic twins, followed for 5 years. The progression of the refraction, the clinical examination, the video-topographic data, and the Orbscan elevation curves of the twins were collected and analyzed. For each twin, there was slightly progressive unilateral keratoconus during that time, located on the right for the first twin and on the left for the second one. Within the current limits of our diagnostic means, it appears to be the first case of mirror unilateral keratoconus in monozygotic twins. Several cases of mirror pathologies have been described, mainly concerning the renal and dental organs. The appearance of such mirror pathologies may be the consequence of the rise of a genetic or environmental factor during the acquisition of the symmetry of the zygote, occurring before its split into two monozygotic embryos.",

    "abstract": "Selecting the \"correct\" face lift technique has always been a difficult decision for the plastic surgeon. A technique that provides optimal aesthetics for one patient may not provide the same result for another. The complexity of comparing these different results on patients with different facial features further confounds one's ability to decide on a given technique. Even identical twins are often treated more appropriately with a different technique from one twin to the other because the character and severity of facial aging may differ between them. By comparing different superficial musculoaponeurotic system techniques on \"less different\" people (identical twins), perhaps the ideal technique may be determined.\nBetween November of 1997 and April of 1999, eight sets of twins underwent face lift surgery by the senior author (D.E.A.), using one of four techniques. The charts and photographs of the eight consecutive pairs of twins (16 patients) were reviewed retrospectively.\nNo one face lift technique performed in this study produced a superior result as compared with another when performed on the appropriate patient.\nThere exists no face lift technique suitable for every patient. As the current literature suggests, there is no one \"best\" face lift technique of those studied.",

    "abstract": "TCF2, the gene encoding for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta, is involved in early renal development. Mutations in TCF2 lead to heterogeneous renal phenotypes. Antenatal ultrasonography may show unilateral/bilateral hyperechogenic or enlarged cystic kidneys. In children or adults, cystic renal hypoplasia/dysplasia is a common feature, occasionally associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 and genital tract abnormalities. We report an unusual presentation characterized by massively enlarged polycystic kidneys mimicking autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in monozygotic twins. Bilateral enlarged cystic kidneys were discovered in week 13 of a gemellic pregnancy. Postnatally, kidney size increased in both children, reaching 16 cm at 20 years. Nephromegaly was associated with bilateral cysts and a slowly decreasing glomerular filtration rate (40 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at 20 years). There was neither pancreatic nor genital malformation. Non-type 1 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed incidentally in both twins at 20 years. Knowledge of early-onset diabetes (at age 19 years) in their father prompted us to search for the TCF2 mutation. Genetic analysis showed complete TCF2 heterozygous whole-gene deletion in both twins. Genetic testing could not be performed in the father. Bilateral massively enlarged polycystic kidneys mimicking autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in young adults may be related to TCF2 mutation. Although uncommon, this new phenotype enlarges the clinical spectrum of kidney involvement associated with TCF2 mutation. In this case, maturity-onset diabetes of the young-type diabetes paved the way to accurate diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Benign natal haemangiomatosis is characterised by the presence of multiple congenital haemangiomas restricted to the skin. It is differentiated from diffuse neonatal haemangiomatosis in which there is both cutaneous and visceral involvement, with higher morbidity and mortality.\nTwo identical twins, I and II (monochorionic placenta, biamniotic), born prematurely at 30 weeks' amenorrhoea, presented twin-transfusion syndrome resulting in retarded intrauterine growth in twin I, the donor, and incipient anasarca in twin II, the recipient. Twin I weighed 960 g while twin II weighed 1 200 g. At birth, miliary haemangiomatosis was observed in both infants (16 haemangiomas in I, 19 in II). Abdominal ultrasound and whole-body MRI performed in the two children revealed multiple angiomatous hepatic nodular lesions in I. Subsequent routine clinical and ultrasound monitoring (hepatic and cardiac) showed increased size of the haemangiomatous lesions over the first 4 months followed by stabilisation and gradual regression. No systemic therapy was required. In twin I an episode of ulceration of a neck haemangioma occurred at 5 months and a favourable outcome was obtained on administration of topical hydrocolloid therapy.\nTwin-transfusion syndrome affects 15 to 30% of monochorionic biamniotic pregnancies. It is a serious complication of twin pregnancies resulting from a dynamic process of interfoetal blood transfusion as a result of venous-venous or arteriovenous vascular anastomoses. In the present case, which appears to be the first reported case, it seems that these monochorionic twins, who shared the same placenta, presented haemangiomatosis simultaneously in utero, if we accept the hypothesis of grafting of emboli of placental microvessels in the formation of congenital haemangiomas.",

    "abstract": "To explore the association between cannabis and personality scores when genetic background and shared environment are controlled for.\nThe co-twin control design. This design provides a powerful method for controlling for the effects of potentially confounding familial factors that may act to predispose subjects both to cannabis use and a particular personality profile.\n118 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for cannabis use.\nData on personality and cannabis use were obtained through a questionnaire survey. The Dutch Sensation Seeking List was used to assess various aspects of sensation seeking. The Amsterdamse Biografische Vragenlijst assessed extraversion, neuroticism, somatic complaints and test attitude.\nThe affected twins scored higher on all scales than their unaffected co-twins, especially on experience seeking (P = 0.004), total sensation seeking score (P = 0.004) and neuroticism (P = 0.039). Differences were also observed when items on drug use were removed from the experience seeking scale (P = 0.037) and total sensation seeking score (P = 0.009) although these differences were no longer significant after Bonferoni correction (P < 0.005).\nCannabis use is associated with a higher score on personality scales. This result was obtained in a sample of monozygotic twins discordant for cannabis use. Thus, at least part of the association between cannabis use and experience seeking cannot be attributed to underlying genetic or shared environmental factors that influence both personality and cannabis use and must be explained by unique environmental influences.",

    "abstract": "Less is known about depression in children than in adults. This study integrates fields by combining cognitive and interpersonal research investigating childhood depression symptoms through the use of a genetic framework. Three research questions are addressed. First, what are the associations among interpersonal cognitions, anxiety, and depression? Second, what are the relative magnitudes of genetic and environmental influences on interpersonal cognitions? Third, to what extent do genetic and environmental influences explain associations between interpersonal cognitions and depression? Three hundred pairs of 8-year-old twins reported on symptoms of depression and anxiety by completing the Children's Depression Inventory and the Screen for Childhood Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders. The authors examined interpersonal cognitions with the Children's Expectation of Social Behaviors and the Perceptions of Peers and Self Questionnaires. Interpersonal cognitions were more strongly correlated with depression (mean r = .35) than with anxiety (mean r = .13). Genetic influence on interpersonal cognitions was small (M = 3%), and associations between interpersonal cognitions and depression were mainly explained by environmental influences. These latter findings may result from interpersonal cognitions in young children, reflecting life experiences as opposed to trait-like cognitive biases.",

    "abstract": "Nonsyndromic clefts of the lip and/or palate are common birth defects with a strong genetic component. Based on unequal gender ratios for clefting phenotypes, evidence for linkage to the X chromosome and the occurrence of several X-linked clefting syndromes, we investigated the role of skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in orofacial clefts. Our samples consisted of female monozygotic (MZ) twins (n = 8) and sister pairs (n = 152) discordant for nonsyndromic clefting. We measured the XCI pattern in peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA using a methylation based androgen receptor gene assay. Skewing of XCI was defined as the deviation in inactivation pattern from a 50:50 ratio. Our analysis revealed no significant difference in the degree of skewing between twin pairs (P = 0.3). However, borderline significant differences were observed in the sister pairs (P = 0.02), with the cleft lip with cleft palate group showing the most significant result (P = 0.01). We did not find evidence for involvement of skewed XCI in the discordance for clefting in our sample of female MZ twins. However, results from the paired sister study suggest the potential contribution of skewed XCI to orofacial clefting, particularly cleft lip and palate.",

    "abstract": "Copper plays an essential role in human physiology and is indispensable for normal growth and development. Enzymes that are involved in connective tissue formation, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, iron transport, and others essential physiological processes require copper as a cofactor to mediate their reactions. The biosynthetic incorporation of copper into these enzymes takes places within the secretory pathway and is critically dependent on the activity of copper-transporting ATPases ATP7A or ATP7B. In addition, ATP7A and ATP7B regulate intracellular copper concentration by removing excess copper from the cell. These two transporters belong to the family of P(1)-type ATPases, share significant sequence similarity, utilize the same general mechanism for their function, and show partial colocalization in some cells. However, the distinct biochemical characteristics and dissimilar trafficking properties of ATP7A and ATP7B in cells, in which they are co-expressed, indicate that specific functions of these two copper-transporting ATPases are not identical. Immuno-detection studies in cells and tissues have begun to suggest specific roles for ATP7A and ATP7B. These experiments also revealed technical challenges associated with quantitative detection of copper-transporting ATPases in tissues, as illustrated here by comparing the results of ATP7A and ATP7B immunodetection in mouse cerebellum.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effect of multifetal pregnancy reduction on the incidence of small for gestational age (SGA) and discordance in reduced versus nonreduced twins and differences in placental pathology. A computerized ultrasound database was used to identify diamniotic-dichorionic twins who delivered at our institution. Reduced (n = 36) versus nonreduced twins (n = 243) were compared for differences in rates of SGA and discordancy (>or= 20%.) The groups were compared for differences in maternal and neonatal characteristics, as well as differences in placental pathology. Chi-square tests were used to compare differences in means. Stepwise logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders including placental pathology. The rate of SGA in either twin A or B remained nonsignificant after adjustment for the use of assisted reproductive technology and gestational age at delivery in the stepwise logistic model (odds ratio, 1.7 95%; confidence interval, 0.5, 5.2). The average discordance at delivery was 12.4% in reduced versus 11.4% in the nonreduced twins ( P = 0.54). We found no overall differences in placental pathology between the two groups. Reduced and nonreduced twins have no significant differences in SGA fetuses, growth discordancy, or placental pathology.",

Absolute and relative risks of developing psoriasis conditioned on the positive history of psoriasis in a co-twin were calculated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression, respectively. Structural equation modelling was used to estimate genetic and environmental variance components.\nAltogether, 334 (4.2%) of the twins reported having psoriasis. No difference in prevalence of the disease across sexes and zygosity groups was found. Identical twins were more likely to develop psoriasis than fraternal twins if a co-twin reported having the disease. The best-fitting model showed that additive genetic effects could explain 66% of the variation in liability for psoriasis in this population, and the remaining 34% was due to non-shared environmental influences.\nHigh heritability due to additive genetic effects together with considerable environmental contribution to the liability of psoriasis support the current opinion on the multifactorial aetiology of the disease. No sex-specific patterns of heritability of psoriasis were found.",

Data were collected from more than 400 hospital-based units involved in the program. The monitored subjects were the hospitalized births from 28 weeks gestation to a period within 7 days after delivery.\n122 conjoined twins were found in 4,282,536 births with an incidence rate of 0. 28 per 10,000. Incidence of conjoined twins was 0.20 per 10,000 and 0.47 per 10,000 in the rural and urban areas, respectively, and the statistical significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed., Incidence of conjoined twins was for 0.17 per 10,000 and 0.36 per 10,000 in boys and girls, respectively. Conjoined twins were more common among females than males, the live-born rate was 41.32%, and the perinatal mortality was 82.6%. 53.7% conjoined twins can be diagnosed prenatally.\nThe results indicate that the incidence of conjoined twins in China is higher than that in Western countries.

    "abstract": "Quadricuspid aortic valves (QAVs) are a rare but well-recognized congenital heart disease and a cause of aortic regurgitation. The first case was reported in 1862. Since then, there have been about 189 cases reported with advances in echocardiography, more cases are diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiography. Hurwitz and Roberts have classified QAV according to the size of the leaflets. Our case demonstrates 2 different valve classifications based on equal and unequal cusp size. In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the first case of QAV in identical twins.",

    "abstract": "Smoking initiation and persistence are clearly associated with factors commonly thought to be environmental in origin, including socio-economic status. However, twin models that incorporate gene-environment correlation and gene x environment interaction have not been applied to elucidate the genetic or environmental role that socio-economic status plays in smoking initiation and nicotine dependence.\nTwin structural equation modelling was used to examine gene-environment correlation and gene x environment interaction of one index of socio-economic status, educational attainment, with smoking initiation and nicotine dependence among 5119 monozygotic and 4295 dizygotic male-male Vietnam-era twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, a national registry of twin pairs who served in the military during the Vietnam era.\nEducational attainment correlated significantly with smoking initiation (r=-0.27, p<0.001). Additive genetic (p=0.011), shared environment (p=0.002) and unique environment (p=0.027) components contributed to the correlation between educational attainment and smoking initiation. Educational attainment also significantly moderated the variance in smoking initiation (p<0.001), suggestive of gene x environment interaction, although the interaction with the additive genetic, shared environmental and unique environmental components could not be resolved due to multi-collinearity. In contrast, educational attainment neither correlated with nor moderated nicotine dependence, once smokers had initiated.\nOur study suggests that educational attainment is associated with smoking initiation, in part due to gene-environment correlation and gene x environment interaction. However, once smoking initiation is taken into account, there are no effects--be they gene-environment correlation or gene x environmental interaction--of educational attainment on nicotine dependence.",

    "abstract": "To compare dietary habits between Finnish twin migrants to Sweden and their co-twins always living in Finland, and to analyse how migration influenced food consumption patterns in the migrants.\nSame-sexed twin pairs born in Finland below 75 years of age, with at least one twin migrating to Sweden (n=1083 pairs). Dietary habits were assessed by a food frequency questionnaire included in a comprehensive mailed questionnaire (response rate 71%). For 76 male twin pairs, information was also collected by a dietary history interview inquiring the habitual diet during the previous year.\nMigrant twins in Sweden had a lower intake of typical Finnish foods like dark bread and berries, and an increased consumption of fresh fruit compared with co-twins living in Finland. The migrants consumed less potatoes and more rice and pasta. Sweet pastries were consumed less often by the migrants and they also tended to more often cut out visible fat of meat and on the other hand add salt to dishes. Among men the migrants had a lower alcohol intake than their co-twins living in Finland.\nMigration from Finland to Sweden is associated with differences in the food pattern that reflect population differences in eating habits between the two countries. The differences include a reduced consumption of typical Finnish foods like dark bread and berries and are of bidirectional nature from the point of view of cardiovascular health.",

    "abstract": "Discordance of fetal genotype or phenotype in a monozygotic twin pregnancy is rare.\nIn case 1, a 28-year-old woman at 15 weeks' gestation was found to have a dichorionic twin pregnancy with 1 fetus affected with hydrop fetalis. The result of chromosomal study showed that the structurally normal fetus was 46,XY and that the hydropic fetus was 45,X. One week after selective termination of the hydropic fetus at 19 weeks' gestation, the cotwin died in utero. In case 2, a 30-year-old woman at 20 weeks' gestation, was found to have a monochorionic twin pregnancy with 1 fetus presenting with omphalocele. The result of chromosomal study showed that both fetuses were 46,XX. The fetus with omphalocele died in utero at 29 weeks' gestation, and the normal cotwin was delivered later due to fetal distress. Analysis by short tandem repeat markers in both cases indicated that they were monozygotic twins.\nThese cases emphasize the importance of zygosity/chorionicity identification in twin pregnancy even though discordance of fetal genotype or phenotype was found. In monozygotic monochorionic twins, the normal cotwin is at risk for an adverse fetal outcome after 1 spontaneous intrauterine fetal death or selective termination. In monozygotic dichorionic twins, the risk of intrauterine fetal demise of the cotwin after selective termination still exists.",

All twins were investigated by a standard questionnaire and physical examinations. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was used to detect the genotypes of S447X and Hind III polymorphisms. Linkage disequilibrium test and haplotypes were estimated between two polymorphisms.\nNine hundred and eighty-seven pairs of twins were eligible for analysis. The two polymorphisms of LPL gene were significantly linkage disequilibrium. In female twins, the H- allele of Hind III polymorphism was significantly related to lower levels of triglycerides(TG) and lower risk of high TG dislipidemia, but those associations disappeared after adjusting the polymorphism of S447X. The H- X haplotype of those two polymorphisms was significantly related to lower TG and TG/HDL (decreasing 12.9% and 14.9% respectively), as well as significantly to lower risk of high TG dislipidemia (OR = 0.40).\nThe haplotypes of S447X and Hind III polymorphisms were significantly related to the favorable effect of lipids,but this effect was mostly determined by the polymorphism of S447X, while the effect of Hind III polymorphism was indirectly influenced by the linkage disequilibrium with S447X polymorphism.",

    "abstract": "We report on the follow-up of a set of monozygotic (MZ) twins who were concordant for peripheral blood karyotype 45,X/46,XY but discordant for phenotypic sex. One twin is a phenotypically normal male and the other twin has asymetrical gonadal dysgenesis. The female twin has the mos45,X/46,XY karyotype in all four tissues: left testis, right streak, vas deferens, and clitoral skin. The normal male twin has the normal 46,XY karyotype in all three tissues tested: foreskin, scrotal skin, and testis. Follow-up of the twins at age 21, revealed persistence of mos45,X/46,XY karyotype in peripheral blood into adult life. However, the male grew up with normal male stature, reaching an adult height of 182 cm. The female twin received low dose estrogen replacement with complete breast development at age 14 years. She reached an adult height of 156 cm. At 21 years of age the male twin had normal testicular endocrine function, but severe oligospermia. The long-term follow-up of this set of MZ twins indicate that the male twin has the mosaicism confined to peripheral blood and has the normal 46,XY male constitution. This was further confirmed by his normal male stature and normal testicular endocrine function. The 45X cell line is likely due to his receiving these cells passively from his twin sister via placental anastomoses in utero. The exposure to these 45,X cells during development may have had an impact on his spermatogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Depression has been associated with decreased blood BDNF concentrations; but it is unclear if low blood BDNF levels are a state or a trait marker of depression.\nWe investigated blood BDNF concentrations in a twin population including both subjects highly predisposed and protected against affective disorder. Whole blood assessed for BDNF concentrations and correlated to risk status, neuroticism, and number of stressful life events.\nBetween the groups, we found no significant difference in whole blood BDNF levels. Women at high-risk for depression who had experienced three or more recent stressful events (n=26) had decreased whole blood BDNF levels compared to high-risk women with two or less recent stressful events (n=35), 21.6+/-7.0 vs. 18.5+/-4.1 ng/ml, respectively, (p<0.05). No such association was found in low-risk women or in men. In men, however, low neuroticism scores and two or less recent stressful events were associated with decreased whole blood BDNF levels (n=50, p<0.05).\nThe cross-sectional design limits the possibility of drawing firm conclusions on causatility of the findings.\nThe genetic risk of developing depression does not translate directly into whole blood BDNF levels.

We carried out a register based study of all twins (N=3411) and a 5% random sample of singletons (N=7796) born in Denmark 1986-1988. We found no difference in school performance in adolescence between twins and singletons, nor when controlling for birth weight, gestational weight, age of parents or parents' education. Progress within living conditions, obstetrics, and paediatrics may be the reason why twins now generally have school performances similarly to singletons.",

Mothers of 56 pairs of monochorionic monozygotic (MCMZ) twins, 34 pairs of dichorionic monozygotic (DCMZ) twins, and 316 pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins rated their children's prosocial behavior. The MCMZ correlation for prosocial behavior was similar to the DCMZ correlation (.63 vs. 61), but both correlations were higher than the DZ correlation (.33). Models incorporating the chorion effects were fit to the data. Genetic, shared and nonshared environmental, and chorion effects in the full model were, respectively, 53% (95% CI: 1-70%), 7% (95% CI: 0-37%) , 40% (95% CI: 29-54%), and 0% (95% CI: 0-27%), with the effects of chorion and shared environment being nonsignificant.

    "abstract": "More boys than girls with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) receive treatment. One explanation for this bias may be that boys score higher on disruptive behavior scales than girls. Although this was supported by findings in clinical samples, recent studies in nonreferred samples showed that boys and girls with ADHD are similar with respect to their levels of disruptive behavior as reported by their mother. In this report, we investigate whether the difference in treatment rate is associated with higher teacher problem scores in boys with ADHD than in girls with ADHD. Data were obtained from mothers and teachers in a nonreferred sample of 283 boys and 291 girls with and without ADHD. Children were selected when they scored either low (controls) or high (probands) on attention problems. Mothers completed DSM-IV interviews, Child Behavior Checklists (CBCL) and the Conners Rating Scale (CRS). Teachers filled in the Teacher Report Form (TRF), and the CRS. Boys and girls with ADHD had similar levels of psychiatric illness and school impairment (such as being held back, special class placement and learning problems) by mother report. Mothers reported similar levels of aggression and attention problems in boys and girls with ADHD. In contrast, teachers consistently rated boys with ADHD as having higher scores on reports of attention problems and aggression than girls with ADHD. Gender differences vary across settings: boys and girls with ADHD are rated as behaving differently at school, but not at home. The higher level of teacher reported problem behavior at school may explain the high male-female ratio for ADHD in clinical settings. These findings have implications for the results of genetic studies that rely on referred samples, as these studies may give a distorted view of sex differences in the population.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical traits such as plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) and uric acid are associated with obesity, and with risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Each is subject to genetic influences, but little is known about changes in genetic and environmental influences on these traits over time. We investigated the contribution of genetic and environmental influences to variation in these biochemical traits in adolescent twins and their nontwin siblings from 965 twin families. Twins were studied at ages 12, 14 and 16 years. Multivariate genetic models that included effects of age and sex were fitted to determine whether the same or different genetic or environmental factors influence each trait at different ages. Results showed that the genetic factors influencing AST, ALT, GGT and uric acid change over time during adolescence, and that the magnitude of these effects differs between males and females. The nonshared environment effects were generally time specific. There are developmental changes in genes affecting these traits during adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Tishler and Carey (this issue, 2007) have analyzed the difference in ever smoking prevalence between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins in 8 published twin studies. They conclude that the lower prevalence in MZ twins might invalidate conclusions from classic twin models. I critique the conducted meta-analysis and suggest additional analyses to be conducted. A reanalysis of the Finnish Twin Cohort 1975 questionnaire data (included in Tisher and Carey) indicates that when intrapair correlations are correctly taken into account, the MZ-DZ difference in that study is no longer statistically significant. Even if the Tisher/Carey finding holds up in further analyses, it pertains only to the observed trait, the effect is small in size, and the mechanism underlying it needs to be explored.",

    "abstract": "Body-mass index (BMI), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels are known to be highly heritable. We evaluated the genetic and environmental relationships of these measures over time in an analysis of twin pairs. Monozygotic (235 pairs) and dizygotic (260 pairs) male twins were participants in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Veteran Twin Study, and were followed with three clinical exams from mean age 48 years to mean age 63 years. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with adjustment for APOE genotype (a significant contributor to TC and LDL-C) was used to assess longitudinal patterns of heritability. Results indicated a contribution of genetic factors to BMI, TC, LDL-C, HLD-C, and TG. Modest increases over time were observed in the heritability of BMI (from 0.48 to 0.61), TC (from 0.46 to 0.57), LDL-C (from 0.49 to 0.64), and HDL-C (from 0.50 to 0.62), but this trend was not present for TG. There was a corresponding decrease in shared environmental influences over time for these traits, although shared environment was a significant contributor only for HDL-C. Moreover, we observed that genetic influences for all measures were significantly correlated over time, and we found no evidence of age-specific genetic effects. In summary, longitudinal analyses of twin data indicate that genetic factors do not account for a significant proportion of the variation in age-related changes of BMI or lipid and lipoprotein levels.",

    "abstract": "The modifying effects of psychiatric and familial risk factors on age at smoking initiation, rate of progression from first cigarette to regular smoking, and transition time from regular smoking to nicotine dependence (ND) were examined in 1269 offspring of male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Mean age of the sample was 20.1 years. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses adjusting for paternal alcohol dependence and ND status and maternal ND were conducted. Both early age at first cigarette and rapid transition from initiation to regular smoking were associated with externalizing disorders, alcohol consumption, and cannabis use. Rapid escalation from regular smoking to ND was also predicted by externalizing disorders, but in contrast to earlier transitions, revealed a strong association with internalizing disorders and no significant relationship with use of other substances. Findings characterize a rarely examined aspect of the course of ND development and highlight critical distinctions in risk profiles across stages of tobacco involvement.",

    "abstract": "Birthweight discordance amongst twins is associated with an increase in perinatal morbidity and mortality. Clinical decisions regarding the management of twins are often made on the basis of estimated fetal weight in the third trimester. This study assesses the efficacy of routine third trimester ultrasound fetal biometry, third trimester fetal growth velocity and first trimester differences in size in the prediction of subsequent birthweight discordance.\nStructurally and chromosomally normal dichorionic twin gestations resulting in two live births after 24 weeks gestation were identified. Ultrasound examinations of dichorionic twin pregnancies between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation were evaluated for inter-twin biometric disparity in crown-rump length (CRL). Estimated fetal weight (EFW) was calculated from the last scan before delivery. Fetal growth velocity (FGV) was calculated from two estimates of fetal weight between 21 and 35 days apart and incorporating the last EFW before delivery. EFW and FGV were expressed as standard deviation scores (Z scores). Disparity between these ultrasound parameters was correlated to inter-twin birthweight difference. Birthweight discordance was defined as > or =20% difference in birthweight relative to the heavier twin. Fishers exact and Spearman rho tests were used for statistical analysis. Test performance is expressed as area under the ROC curve and likelihood ratios (LR).\nOne hundred and thirty-five dichorionic gestations were identified over a consecutive 3-year-period. One hundred and eight twin gestations had both crown-rump length (CRL) and sufficient ultrasound measurements in the third trimester to calculate FGV. Twenty-six pregnancies (24%) had discordant birthweight. Only EFW Z score difference was correlated with birthweight disparity (r=0.36, p = <0.001). An EFW Z score difference of 0.6 had an area under the ROC curve of 0.70 (95% C.I. 0.59-0.79) but this did not differ significantly from first trimester prediction of growth discordance which had an area of 0.55 (95% C.I. 0.44-0.66). The LR for first and third trimester prediction of discordance were low.\nUltrasound measurement of fetal growth velocity and size both in the first and third trimesters is a poor predictor of birthweight discordance. Disparate fetal growth is exhibited as early as 10-14 weeks gestation and differences at this early stage in fetal development are no less accurate than EFW within 1 month of delivery. First trimester ultrasound, third trimester growth velocity and third trimester EFW do not accurately predict the delivery of twins with discordant birthweight.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of genetic factors to individual differences in food use was estimated in a large population-based twin cohort of young adults (22- to 27-year-old). Male and female twins (n=2009 complete twin pairs) evaluated use-frequencies of 24 food items using 5 categories (1=never-5=several times a day) in a postal questionnaire. Foods were categorized by factor analysis. Estimates of the relative proportions of additive genetic, shared environmental, and unshared environmental effects on the use-frequency of food items and factor scores were obtained by quantitative genetic modeling of twin data based on linear structural equations. Four factors of food use were identified: \"healthy\" foods, high-fat foods, sweet foods, and meats. The variance of the use-frequency of food items and food categories was explained by additive genetic and unshared environmental influences, whereas shared environmental factors did not contribute to food use. The average proportions of genetic effects on the total variance of the use-frequency of food items and food categories were 40% and 45%, respectively. Sex differences were observed in the magnitude of genetic influences for use-frequency of four food items (chocolate, other sweets, fried foods, and meat), and in genetic factors underlying the use of three (fresh vegetables, fruits, and cheeses) items. In conclusion, family environment does not appear to influence the food use of young adults and thus nutritional education should be targeted at this age group to support development of healthy eating patterns. In addition, the results illuminate the importance of the sex-specific genetic effects on food use.",

    "abstract": "Genes that influence a phenotype earlier in life may differ from those influencing the same phenotype later, particularly during significant development periods such as puberty, when it is known that new genetic and environmental influences may become important. In the present study, body mass index (BMI) data were collected from 470 monozygotic twin pairs and 673 dizygotic twin pairs longitudinally at ages 12, 14 and 16, roughly straddling puberty. In order to examine whether there are qualitative and quantitative differences in genetic and environmental influences affecting BMI in males and females, during development, a general sex-limitation simplex model (which represents the longitudinal time series of the data) was fitted to the repeated measurements of BMI. The ADE simplex model provided the best fit to the adolescent data, with disparity in the magnitude of additive genetic influences between sexes, but no differences in the non-additive genetic (epistasis or dominance) or environmental influences. Results found may reflect many genetic and environmental influences during puberty, including the possible complex interaction between genes involved in the biological mechanism of weight regulation and the development of likely peer pressured activities such as severe exercise and diet regimes. Although, over 1,000 pairs of twins were used, this study still lacked the power to properly discriminate between additive and non-additive genetic variance.",

    "abstract": "The relative importance of determinants in bone mineral density (BMD) in adult men is partly unclear. Our goals were to investigate the effects of familial aggregation and behavioral factors on the change in BMD during a 5-yr follow-up. Subjects (n=140) were 70 exposure-discordant monozygotic twin pairs (age 35-69 yr). BMD was measured with the same dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner at baseline and at the 5-yr follow-up. A variety of covariates were used including physical examination and interview data. Multivariate linear regression was used. The mean annual decrease in femoral BMD was 0.2%. The mean lumbar BMD was unchanged, although 8-17% of subjects had a decrease of more than 5%. Familial aggregation explained 14% of the changes in femoral BMD and 19% in lumbar BMD. The stability of BMD in the follow-up was high, both for individuals (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.90-0.94) and for co-twins in a pair (ICC=0.77-0.84). In femoral BMD, use of alcohol (p=0.006), coffee (p=0.046), and beta-blockers (p=0.043) led to increases, whereas smoking led to a decrease (p<0.01). We concluded that frequent increases in BMD, influenced by beta-blockers, partly explain the minor mean changes during follow-up; however, about every 10th subject had a significant decrease. Overall, familial effects played a dominant role in BMD changes in adult men.",

    "abstract": "A number of different theoretical approaches to understanding the etiology of ejaculatory dysfunction have been proposed, but no behavior genetic study has yet, to our knowledge, been conducted to explore the genetic and environmental influences on ejaculatory dysfunction.\nThe aim of the present study was to explore the genetic and environmental effects on premature (PE) and delayed (DE) ejaculation in a population-based sample.\nThe genetic and environmental influences on PE and DE were investigated in a population-based sample of 1,196 Finnish male twins, age 33-43 years, with 91 identical and 110 complete twin pairs. Several different aspects of ejaculatory function were measured by a self-report questionnaire (e.g., latency time, subjective experience of ejaculatory control). Factor analyses distinguished two subcomponents of ejaculatory function, and subsequently, composite variables measuring PE and DE were created. Structural equation modeling was performed on the composite variables.\nMeasurement of genetic and environmental effects on PE and DE.\nThe results suggested moderate genetic influence (28%) on PE, but not on DE (0%). There was a moderate familial effect on DE with shared environmental effects accounting for 24% of the variance. However, omission of the shared environmental component did not directly result in a significantly decreased model fit for DE, and omission of the additive genetic component did not directly result in a significantly decreased fit for the PE model.\nThe findings from the present study provide useful information regarding the etiology and understanding of ejaculatory dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Genetics and environment both play a role in weight maintenance. Twin studies may help clarify the influence of nature vs nurture in weight loss. We present the largest U.S. experience with monozygotic (MZ) twins undergoing bariatric surgery.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the charts of four sets of MZ twins who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) surgery and laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) placement at three different institutions. BMI and co-morbidities were examined pre- and postoperatively, and laboratory values were recorded.\nAll four sets of twins are female, live together, and have similar professions. Twin cohort 1 had near identical weight loss patterns after open RYGBP surgery in 1996 (preop 146/142 kg; 2 years 82/82; and 10 years 108/107). Twin cohort 1 also both underwent cholecystectomies within the first year postoperatively. Twin cohort 2 underwent laparoscopic RYGBP surgery and also required cholecystectomies in the first postoperative year. Cohort 2 also experienced nearly identical weight loss at 1 year (36.7% vs 37.0% BMI loss). Twin cohort 3 underwent LAGB placement with two different surgeons with differing amounts of weight loss at 6 months (6.5% vs 15.7% BMI loss). Finally, twin cohort 4 underwent laparoscopic RYGBP with 2-year BMI loss of 39% vs 34%. In twin cohort 4, the twin who lost less weight lived apart from her twin and extended family, and her weight loss was less than the twin living with her family.\nTwo sets of MZ twins had identical responses to bariatric surgery. The other two sets of identical twins had differential weight loss results, possibly due to differences in surgical approach and social support. While genetics do exert a strong influence on weight loss and maintenance, this case series demonstrates the potential effect of social support and postoperative management upon postoperative weight loss in the presence of identical genetics.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors regulating the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism in a complex and to some extent unknown manner. Our aim was to study the impact of different factors on PPARdelta mRNA expression in human skeletal muscle on one side, and the impact of PPARdelta mRNA expression on these factors, including glucose and lipid metabolism, aerobic capacity, fibre type composition and lipid profile, on the other side. PPARdelta mRNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR in muscle biopsies from 176 young and elderly monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Young twins had significantly increased PPARdelta mRNA levels compared with elderly twins. A 2 h hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp had no significant effect on PPARdelta mRNA levels. Biometric models were calculated for basal PPARdelta mRNA expression to estimate the degree of genetic versus environmental influence. In both young and elderly twins there was a substantial genetic component influencing basal PPARdelta mRNA levels. In a regression model, the muscle PPARdelta mRNA expression was correlated to birth weight, central adiposity and age. The level of PPARdelta mRNA was also positively correlated with markers for oxidative muscle fibres. However, in this apparently healthy study population, we found no correlations between PPARdelta mRNA expression and aerobic capacity, lipid profile or glucose and lipid metabolism. In conclusion, we provide evidence that mRNA expression of PPARdelta in human skeletal muscle is under genetic control but also influenced by factors such as age, birth weight and central adiposity.",

    "abstract": "Finland and Sweden are neighbouring countries with a substantially higher incidence and mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) in Finland. Migration from Finland to Sweden has resulted in a population of about 187,000 Finnish immigrants, with a higher risk of CHD than Swedes. The aim of the present study was to analyse the prevalence of CHD in migrants to Sweden compared with co-twins remaining in Finland.\nThe study population consisted of twin pairs of the Finnish Twin Cohort Study where at least one twin had lived one year or more in Sweden, including 1,534 subjects and 251 complete twin pairs discordant regarding residency in Sweden. Emigrant twins were compared with nonmigrant co-twins regarding prevalence of CHD in 1998. CHD prevalence was assessed by self-reported questionnaires validated using information from a clinical examination.\nSelf-reported CHD showed a good correspondence with clinical diagnosis. Differences in social and behavioural risk factors for CHD among men were small but emigrants were more physically active than non-migrants. Female emigrants had less overweight and better education, but were more often working class than non-migrants. Intra-pair comparisons restricted to migration discordant pairs showed a tendency towards a reduced prevalence of CHD in the migrant co-twins (0.6; 0.3-1.4). In analyses of all subjects disregarding pair status, emigrants showed a reduced prevalence of CHD compared with subjects always living in Finland (0.6; 0.4-0.9).\nEmigration from Finland to Sweden may be associated with a reduced prevalence of CHD. The causes are most likely multifactorial and may involve changes in dietary habits, physical activity, psychosocial factors, and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The twin reverse arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence is a serious complication of monochorionic multiple pregnancies in which the affected twin is reversely perfused from the healthy co-twin, resulting in severely abnormal or absent cardiac development, severe malformations, and massive hydrops fetalis. The acardiac twin threatens the survival of the pump twin either by increasing the risk of congestive cardiac failure or by the development of polyhydramnios, preterm premature rupture of membranes, preterm labour and premature delivery. A wide spectrum of surgical interventions has been applied in the management of TRAP; however, because of the rarity of this condition and the heterogeneity of its presentation, no single technique has been shown to be unequivocally optimal. In our experience, fetoscopic laser coagulation of the placental vascular anastomoses or the umbilical cord of the acardiac twin, with the possibility of applying bipolar forceps as an additional minimally invasive surgical technique, offers an effective treatment option in the management of the TRAP sequence; this treatment has a survival rate of 80%, and 67% of pregnancies with surviving pump twins go beyond 36 weeks of gestation without further complications.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a common disabling condition, with known environmental and familial risk factors and with their assumed interactions. We wanted to carry out a family study on asthma to address gene-environment interactions at a population level.\nWe conducted a nation-wide study on familial risks for asthma. An asthma database was constructed by linking the Multigeneration Register on 0-72-year-old subjects to the Hospital Discharge Register for diagnosed asthma cases in Sweden from years 1987 to 2004. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for affected singleton siblings, twins and spouses by comparing with those whose siblings or spouses had no asthma.\nA total of 67 370 hospitalized cases and 5638 affected siblings were identified with a familial SIR of 3.70, which was independent of sex, diagnostic age and age differences between the siblings. The SIR for different-sex twins was 5.17 and for same-sex twins it was 13.38. There was a low correlation between spouses for asthma.\nAsthma shows a higher familial risk than many common diseases. The higher difference in familial excess risk between singleton siblings and different-sex twins provides strong genetic epidemiological evidence for gene-environment interactions in asthma. The concept of gene-environment interactions needs to be accommodated in future aetiological studies on asthma. Data on environmental factors and family history are important for clinical risk estimation.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital disorder at birth. Yagel and colleagues's method of heart examination has been proved valuable in finding CHD prenatally in single pregnancies. The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency of CHD in twin pregnancies and the sensitivity of the method.\nA total of 1103 pregnant women with twins were enrolled in this study, including 127 cases with high-risk for CHD. Five transverse ultrasound measurements were used for fetal heart examination, including the upper abdomen view, four-chamber view, five-chamber view, pulmonary artery bifurcation view, and three-vessel view. In the fetuses who were diagnosed with CHD and whose parents requested termination of the pregnancy, autopsy of the fetal heart was performed after an abortion, and a blood sample was collected from the heart for chromosome evaluation. In the other fetuses, a close follow-up was conducted by echocardiography within one year after birth.\nAntenatally, CHD was found in 12 twins, of which 4 were from the high-risk group (3.15%), and 8 from the low-risk group (0.82%). In 2 pairs of the twins, the two fetuses had a same kind of CHD (one pair had tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), another pair had rhabdomyoma). Another pair had different types of anomaly (one fetus had TOF, and the other duodenal atresia with a normal heart). Termination of pregnancy was performed in these three pairs and the autopsy of the fetal heart confirmed the ultrasound findings. In the other 9 pairs, CHD was detected in one fetus, and a normal heart in the others. In the cases who received chromosome evaluation, 2 had abnormal chromosomes. During the follow-up after birth, heart examinations confirmed the prenatal diagnosis in 7 of the 9. The diagnosis of CHD was missed antenatally in 2 pairs of twins. In both the cases, one fetus was normal, and the other was confirmed as having CHD after birth (small ventricle septum defect in one, and persistent open ductus arteriosus in the other). Thus, the total frequency of CHD was 16 (7.3/1000), which was similar to that in single pregnancies. The sensitivity of fetal echocardiography was 87.5% and the specificity was 100%.\nThe frequency of CHD is the same in twin as in single pregnancies. Systemic ultrasound scanning with five transverse views is effective in diagnosing fetal CHD in twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "In his 1978 article on tuberculosis (TB) in twins, Comstock concluded that the 2.5-fold higher concordance rate for TB among monozygotic versus dizygotic twins in the Prophit survey of the 1950s implicated inherited susceptibility as a major risk factor for TB in humans. His analysis did not take into account strong imbalance of variables within subgroups, underestimating possible confounding effects of environmental factors.\nTo reconsider the role of environmental versus hereditary factors in determining the concordance rate of TB among twin pairs.\nReanalysis of the Prophit Survey.\nA known Mycobacterium tuberculosis-positive or M. tuberculosis-negative sputum in the index TB case markedly influenced the odds ratio (OR) of concordance in the twin pairs. In 87 pairs with co-twins exposed to a sputum-negative index case, monozygotic and dizygotic twins did not differ in concordance for TB (OR, 1.1; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.4-2.8). A higher concordance rate for TB among monozygotic versus dizygotic twins was confined to 106 pairs with the co-twins exposed to a sputum-positive index case (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.6-7.2), and was highest in adolescent twins living together. ORs of TB concordance were proportional to intensity of exposure (sputum smear positivity, physical proximity between twin pairs, contagiousness of disease, and living together) rather than to zygosity.\nIn the Prophit survey of susceptibility to TB among twins, environmental factors (i.e., intensity of exposure to tubercle bacilli) outweigh the importance of hereditary factors. Environmental factors and the context of transmission should be given more emphasis when studying interindividual and population differences in susceptibility to infectious diseases such as TB.",

Here, we show a random recruitment of T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta clonotypes of the initial HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells during primary infection in two genetically identical twins infected simultaneously with the same virus, suggesting that stochastic TCR recruitment of HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells contributes to the diverse and unpredictable HIV-1 sequence evolution.",

    "abstract": "Preterm male infants are at a disadvantage when compared with female infants regarding the incidence of respiratory and neurologic morbidity and mortality. At term, female infants from unlike-sex twin pairs have birth weights that are closer to their male co-twins than to girls from like-sex twin pairs. We hypothesized that if the male disadvantage is mediated via factors that affect fetal lung development, there may be a potential effect on the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its complications in female infants from unlike-sex pairs.\nIn this population-based study we used data from the Israel Neonatal Network, which included data from 8858 very low birth weight (500-1500 g) infants of 24 to 34 weeks' gestation. The incidence of morbidity and mortality was compared in male and female infants from singletons and like-sex and unlike-sex twin pairs. Multivariable analyses were used, accounting for relevant confounding variables.\nMale singletons and like-sex twins were at increased risk for mortality, respiratory distress syndrome, pneumothorax, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia. However, in unlike-sex twin pairs, no difference was seen in the incidence of respiratory morbidity between male and female twins. The male disadvantage was maintained for mortality and periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage.\nThese findings suggest that the difference in morbidity and mortality between male and female premature infants represents a male disadvantage as opposed to a female advantage and that this disadvantage may be transferred from boys to girls in unlike-sex twin pairs, perhaps via an intrauterine paracrine effect.",

    "abstract": "Exercise capacity is reduced after both short- and long-duration exposures to microgravity. Previously, we have documented that supine treadmill exercise within lower-body negative pressure (LBNP(ex)) maintains upright exercise responses in men after 5 and 15 d of bed rest, as a simulation of microgravity.\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether LBNP(ex) would protect against loss of upright exercise capacity (VO2peak) and sprint performance during a longer-duration bed rest.\nEight sets of male twins participated in 30 d of bed rest. Within each twin pair, one was randomly assigned to a control group (CON) who performed no exercise, and the other was assigned to an exercise group (EX) that performed a 40-min interval (40-80% pre-bed rest VO2peak) LBNP(ex) (55 +/- 4 mm Hg) protocol, plus 5 min of resting LBNP, 6 d.wk(-1). LBNP produced footward force equivalent to 1.0-1.2 body weight. Before and after bed rest, subjects completed an upright graded exercise test to volitional fatigue and a sprint test of 30.5 m.\nAfter bed rest, VO2peak was decreased significantly in the CON subjects (-23 +/- 4%, P < 0.01) but was maintained in the EX subjects (-3 +/- 3%). Sprint time was increased in the CON subjects (24 +/- 8%, P < 0.05) but was maintained in the EX group (8 +/- 2%).\nThis exercise countermeasure protocol may help prevent microgravity-induced deconditioning during long-duration space flight.",

Late cognitive effects after chemotherapy can have a deleterious impact on survivor quality of life and functional health; however, the etiology of chemotherapy-related cognitive dysfunction remains unknown.\nWe present a case of monozygotic twins who are discordant for breast cancer and chemotherapy exposure (ie, one twin contracted breast cancer and underwent chemotherapy, and the other had no breast cancer). As part of a larger study, each was evaluated with standardized, self-report measures of cognitive function, standard neuropsychological tests, and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nResults indicated small differences in neuropsychological test performance but striking contrasts in self-reported cognitive complaints and structural and functional MRI images. Specifically, the twin who underwent chemotherapy had substantially more subjective cognitive complaints, more white matter hyperintensities on MRI, and an expanded spatial extent of brain activation during working memory processing than her nonaffected twin.\nThis case illustrates possible physiologic mechanisms that could produce long-term cognitive complaints among chemotherapy recipients and help formulate hypotheses for further empirical study in the area of chemotherapy-associated cognitive dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) occurs in approximately 3-10% of singleton pregnancies, in 9.1% of all twins, and in 9.9% of monochorionic twins. Spontaneous demise of the IUGR twin may occur and may result in concomitant demise or severe neurological handicap of the other twin. Currently, monochorionic twins with selective IUGR (SIUGR) are managed expectantly. Alternatively, all adverse consequences resulting from the potential demise of the SIUGR twin could be averted by unlinking the circulations between the two fetuses. The latter can be achieved by laser photocoagulation of communicating vessels or by umbilical-cord occlusion. The purpose of this chapter is to review this important entity in obstetrics.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a vanishing twin on the risk of being small-for-gestational age (SGA) in in vitro fertilization (IVF) singletons.\nThe study included 642 survivors of a vanished co-twin, 5237 primary singletons and 3678 primary twins. The survivor cohort was subdivided according to gestational age at the time of vanishing to give groups of early (<8 weeks), intermediate (8-22 weeks) and late (>22 weeks) survivors.\nThe rate of SGA infants was significantly higher in survivors than in singletons (OR: 1.50, 95%CI: 1.03-2.20) and a significant inverse correlation was observed between SGA and the gestational age at the time of vanishing (r = -0.10, P < 0.02). Also in term infants, the risk of birthweight <2500 g was higher in survivors than in singletons (OR: 1.71, 95%CI: 1.06-2.74).

    "abstract": "Although over 50 twin and adoption studies have been performed on the genetic architecture of antisocial behaviour, far fewer studies have investigated prosocial behaviour, and none have done so on a non-western population. The present study examined mothers' ratings of prosocial behaviour in 514 pairs of 2- to 9-year-old South Korean monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Correlational analyses showed a tendency of increasing genetic effects and decreasing shared environmental effects with age although shared family environment effects and the moderating effects of age did not attain statistical significance in model-fitting analyses. The best-fitting model indicated that 55% (95% CI: 45-64%) of the variance in the 2- to 9-year-olds' prosocial behaviour was due to genetic factors and 45% (95% CI: 36-55%) was due to non-shared environmental factors. It is concluded that genetic and environmental influences on prosocial behaviour in young South Koreans are mostly similar to those in western samples.",

    "abstract": "During aging, chromosome ends, or telomeres, gradually erode or shorten with each somatic cell division. Loss of telomere length homeostasis has been linked to age-related disease. Remarkably, specific environmental assaults, both physical and psychological, have been shown to correlate with shortened telomeres. However, the extent that genetic and/or environmental factors may influence telomere length during later stages of lifespan is not known. Telomere length was measured in 686 male US World War II and Korean War veteran monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins (including 181 MZ and 125 DZ complete pairs) with a mean age of 77.5 years (range 73-85 years). During the entire process of telomere length measurement, participant age and twin status were completely blinded. White blood cell mean telomere length shortened in this elderly population by 71 base pairs per year (P < 0.0001). We observed no evidence of heritable effects in this elderly population on telomere length maintenance, but rather find that telomere length was largely associated with shared environmental factors (P < 0.0001). Additionally, we found that individuals with hypertension and cardiovascular disease had significantly shorter telomeres (P = 0.0025 and 0.002, respectively). Our results emphasize that shared environmental factors can have a primary impact on telomere length maintenance in elderly humans.",

The coronary flow reserve obtained from the LCX was lower than the normal value matched for the same age group. The increased shunt flow resulted in enlargement of the left ventricular chamber. This is the first report of coronary flow characteristics in children with multiple coronary fistulae.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to analyse differences in cord characteristics between naturally conceived twins and twins born after assisted reproduction.\nBetween 1985 and 2004, the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey (EFPTS) registered 4159 twin pairs. We compared cord characteristics between 2119 naturally conceived dizygotic (DZ) twin members and 2243 DZ twin members originating from assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Data were adjusted for intra-twin correlation, year of birth, maternal age, gestational age, parity, sex of the child and number of placentas.\nMarginal cord insertion, velamentous cord insertion and single umbilical artery (SUA) occur more frequently in twins following infertility treatment (P < 0.001). The incidence of velamentous cord insertion increases proportionate with 'invasiveness' of reproductive techniques: 3.6% in naturally conceived twins versus 5% in twins after artificial induction of ovulation (AIO) [odds ratio (OR) 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-2.11], 7.4% in twins after IVF (OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.26-1.77) and 10.4% in twins after ICSI (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.14-1.51). SUA has the highest incidence in twins after AIO: 1.9% compared with 0.6% in naturally conceived twins (OR 3.19; 95% CI 1.66-6.11).\nUmbilical cords of twins born after ART have more pathologic characteristics when compared with cords of naturally conceived twins.",

    "abstract": "To what extent do genetic and environmental influences on reading disability overlap with those on mathematics disability? Multivariate genetic research on the normal range of variation in unselected samples has led to a Generalist Genes Hypothesis which posits that the same genes largely affect individual differences in these abilities in the normal range. However, little is known about the etiology of co-morbidity for the disability extremes of reading and mathematics.\nFrom 2596 pairs of 10-year-old monozygotic and dizygotic twins assessed on a web-based battery of reading and mathematics tests, we selected the lowest 15% on reading and on mathematics. We conducted bivariate DeFries-Fulker (DF) extremes analyses to assess overlap and specificity of genetic and environmental influences on reading and mathematics disability defined by a 15% cut-off.\nBoth reading and mathematics disability are moderately heritable (47% and 43%, respectively) and show only modest shared environmental influence (16% and 20%). There is substantial phenotypic co-morbidity between reading and mathematics disability. Bivariate DF extremes analyses yielded a genetic correlation of .67 between reading disability and mathematics disability, suggesting that they are affected largely by the same genetic factors. The shared environmental correlation is .96 and the non-shared environmental correlation is .08.\nIn line with the Generalist Genes Hypothesis, the same set of generalist genes largely affects mathematical and reading disabilities. The dissociation between the disabilities occurs largely due to independent non-shared environmental influences.",

    "abstract": "Twins compared with singletons and monozygous (MZ) compared with dizygous (DZ) twins are at increased risk of fetal and infant death, cerebral palsy and many congenital anomalies. The aim of this study is to investigate whether zygosity is a risk factor for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Birth registration data and draft infant death certificates for all multiple births in England and Wales 1993 to 2003 were provided by the Office for National Statistics. As a partial proxy for zygosity, same-sex was compared with opposite-sex twins for birthweight-specific mortality and mortality attributed to SIDS. Data on singleton infants were obtained by subtraction of multiple births from routinely published population births and infant deaths. SIDS mortality among low birthweight infants was significantly less in twins than singletons. The twin-singleton relative risk was reversed in infants of normal birthweight. Among infants of normal birthweight, neonatal SIDS was significantly more common in same- compared with opposite-sex pairs. Among infants of low birthweight, postneonatal SIDS was significantly more common in same- compared with opposite-sex pairs. The difference in birthweight distribution of same- compared with opposite-sex twins for neonatal SIDS suggests that zygosity is a risk factor for SIDS. As congenital cerebral anomalies are a feature of many monozygous twin conceptions, a detailed macro- and microscopical examination of the brain in twin SIDS may indicate an otherwise unrecognised pathology.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated a link between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental coordination disorder (DCD), and depression. The present study utilized a monozygotic (MZ) differences design to investigate differences in depressive symptomatology between MZ twins discordant for ADHD or DCD. This extends previous research as it controls for genetic effects and shared environmental influences and enables the investigation of nonshared environmental influences. In addition, children and adolescents with comorbid ADHD and DCD were compared on their level of depressive symptomatology to those with ADHD only, DCD only, and no ADHD or DCD. The parent-rated Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behavior, Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire, and Sad Affect Scale were used to assess ADHD, DCD, and depressive symptomatology respectively. The results revealed higher levels of depressive symptomatology in MZ twins with ADHD or DCD compared to their nonaffected co-twins. In addition, children and adolescents with comorbid ADHD and DCD demonstrated higher levels of depressive symptomatology compared to those with ADHD only, DCD only, and no ADHD or DCD. The implications of these findings are discussed with emphasis on understanding and recognizing the relationship between ADHD, DCD, and depression in the assessment and intervention for children and adolescents with these disorders.",

    "abstract": "This article analyzes the effect of classroom separation of twins on their cognitive abilities, measured at different ages in Dutch primary education. We use a large longitudinal school-based sample of twins and their classmates. The analysis tries to reduce the bias by unobserved factors due to the nonrandom assignment of twins by taking into account differences in school environment, previous test scores and variation in class assignment between years. We find that classroom separation matters for language in Grade 2. Nonseparated twins score higher on language, and the difference is larger for same-sex pairs. This finding is robust for various methods that take unobserved effects into account. In addition, there is some evidence for higher scores in arithmetic in Grade 2. For the higher grades we find no effect of classroom separation on cognitive ability. In the analysis of the effect of a separation of at least 3 years we find that separation increases language performance between Grade 6 and 8 for opposite-sex pairs.",

    "abstract": "Interference processing requires increased focus on relevant dimensions of environmental stimuli and selective allocation of attentional resources, in order to filter extraneous information and inhibit non-adaptive responses. This process is important in everyday life and is necessary for responding to novel and challenging situations. Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is involved in this process, and behavioral twin studies indicate that performance on interference processing tasks is highly heritable. However, the extent to which dACC activation related to such tasks is influenced by genetic factors has not been reported. In the current study, 10 pairs of monozygotic and 10 pairs of dizygotic female twins performed a validated interference processing task during fMRI. There were three main results: (1) increased dACC activation for incongruent (INC) minus congruent (CON) trials was observed; (2) dACC activation for INC minus CON trials was both moderately heritable and significantly correlated with the difference in reaction time (RT) between INC and CON trials; (3) RT for INC trials was moderately heritable. RT for CON trials and the latency difference between INC and CON trials were not influenced significantly by genetic factors. The current study provides the first functional imaging evidence that dACC activation during interference processing is significantly influenced by genes. These results suggest an endophenotype that may be applied to various psychiatric disorders that are both highly heritable and associated with altered dACC function.",

    "abstract": "Increased neurotoxicity and poor long-term neurocognitive outcome of preschool children treated for brain tumors have led to innovative therapeutic strategies in order to delay or avoid the use of craniospinal radiation and to improve survival. Because these protocols are relatively new, few data exist regarding cognitive outcome. We conducted a twin case-control study to investigate neurocognitive and behavioral outcome in a preschool patient who was 16 months old at diagnosis of medulloblastoma and was treated with surgery, chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, and focal radiation to the tumor bed. Stability and change over two assessments were compared for the patient and her nonaffected twin for standardized measures of cognitive function and experimental measures of parent-child interaction, social competence, and goal-directed play. A striking finding was improvement in intelligence, receptive language, and visual-motor functioning in the affected twin from 12 months to 24 months after treatment. Improvement in ratings of parent-child interaction and social competence for the affected twin was also evident. These findings are notable compared with the potentially devastating impact of craniospinal tumor, and this study is among the first to document the relative benefit of focal radiation in sparing cognitive function, albeit in a single case study.",

    "abstract": "The amniotic band disruption complex (ABDC) has been attributed to vascular disruption by some authors, not by others. Acardiac twins (ATs), however, have been generally accepted as a prime example of vascular disruption. In this study a comparison was made of these two entities to determine if they were similar or not, and thus we attempted to resolve the controversy of the mechanisms in the ABDC. A female tendency (2:1) was found in the ABDC in contrast to the \"normal\" sex distribution (0.88:1) in the ATs (p < 0.001). Most types of malformations (66%) were mutually exclusive, notably those of the cranium/brain, abdominal wall, and most internal organs; 83% were more significantly related to one or other of the entities. The ABDC malformations tended to occur unilaterally, but in the ATs they occurred bilaterally (p < 0.0001); the former tended to involve external organs and the latter internal organs (p < 0.0001). With so many differences, the two entities are unlikely due to the same mechanism: the ABDC is more likely to be due to external disruption.",

    "abstract": "An adverse intrauterine environment indicated by both low birth weight and monozygosity is associated with an age- or time-dependent reduction in glucose disposal and nonoxidative glucose metabolism in twins, suggesting impaired regulation of muscle glycogen synthesis.\nWe measured the activities of glycogen synthase (GS), GS kinase (GSK)3 alpha, GS phosphorylation, and glycogen levels in muscle biopsies obtained from 184 young and elderly twins before and after a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp.\nElderly monozygotic twins had significantly lower fractional GS activity amidst higher glycogen and GS protein levels compared with dizygotic twins. In addition, we demonstrated strong nongenetic associations between birth weight and defect muscle glycogen metabolism in elderly--but not in younger--twins. Thus, for every 100 g increase in birth weight within pairs, GS fractional activity, GS protein level, and glycogen content was increased by 4.2, 8.7, and 4.5%, respectively, in elderly twins. Similarly, for every 100 g increase in birth weight, GSK3 alpha activity and GS phosphorylation at the sites 2, 2+2a, and 3a+3b were decreased by 3.1, 9.0, 10.1, and 9.5%, respectively.\nThe age- or time-dependent nongenetic impact of birth weight on insulin action in twins may partly be explained by reduced insulin activation of muscle GS, mediated through increased GSK3 alpha activity and GS phosphorylation. Reduced GS activity and negative feedback inhibition of glycogen metabolism by glycogen per se may contribute to the insulin resistance in elderly monozygotic compared with dizygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to provide a critical update of the impact of the 'thrifty phenotype hypothesis' on metabolism, and its implications for heritability estimates as obtained in so-called classical twin studies.\nOur recent studies demonstrated a complex age or time-dependent relationship between different and independent markers of an adverse intrauterine environment, including birth weight, twin and zygosity status on one side, and distinct defects of insulin secretion and glucose metabolism on the other side.\nThese novel findings may, to some unknown extent, influence and perhaps bias the heritability estimates of type 2 diabetes-related traits obtained using classical twin analyses. The studies add to the increasing evidence of the intrauterine environment as a - or the - key player in the cause and pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. We and others have shown that monozygotic twins represent a powerful tool to demonstrate nongenetic associations between low birth weight and different phenotypes of the metabolic syndrome, including type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and, recently, hypertension. Future studies of discordant monozygotic twins may provide novel and crucial mechanistic explanations of the link between low birth weight and the metabolic syndrome.",

We describe a pair of 1(1/2)-month-old dizygotic twins with laterally deviated nail plates of the great toenails since birth. By the time the infants were 10 months of age, significant realignment was observed. Adult pedigree members also showed slight similar deviations of the nail plates. We suggest that desynchronization of growth between the nail and the adherent end-phalanx of the hallux may result in temporarily larger nail plates, which are gliding outwards, in order to fit into the underlying bony space. During postnatal life, spontaneous realignment is usually observed, probably as a result of a faster growing end-phalanx.",

    "abstract": "Childhood ketotic hypoglycemia (KH) is a disease characterized by fasting hypoglycemia and increased levels of ketone bodies. The cause is unknown.\nThe objective of the study was to study a pair of homozygotic twin boys, one of whom had severe KH from the age of 14 months, whereas the other boy was apparently healthy.\nAt the age of 6 yr, the boys were thoroughly investigated. During a 24-h fasting tolerance test, the twin with KH showed hypoglycemia (blood glucose 2.0 mmol/liter) after 18 h. Three h before the occurrence of hypoglycemia, he had had 10 times higher beta-hydroxybutyrate levels than his brother, who showed no signs of hypoglycemia. Their glucose production rates were normal and similar (23.3 and 21.7 micromol/kg body weight per minute in the healthy and KH twin, respectively) as well as their lipolysis rates (5.8 and 6.8 micromol/kg body weight per minute, respectively). During repeated 60-min infusions of beta-hydroxybutyrate, the plasma level of beta-hydroxybutyrate increased 5-10 times more in the twin with KH (mean 1.1 mmol/liter in the healthy and 10.8 mmol/liter in the KH twin), indicating a disturbed clearance or metabolism of beta-hydroxybutyrate. No mutations were found in genes involved in ketone body metabolism or transport.\nIn the affected boy, KH seems to be the result of a reduced capacity to use ketone bodies, leading to increased peripheral metabolism of glucose that cannot be met by hepatic glucose production. Because the boys are homozygotic twins and only one of them is affected, the ketotic hypoglycemia is most likely caused by an altered imprinting of gene(s) involved in regulating metabolic pathways.",

    "abstract": "In singleton gestations, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) has been shown to reduce the rate of recurrent preterm birth. This study was undertaken to evaluate whether 17P would reduce the rate of preterm birth in twin gestations.\nWe performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 14 centers. Healthy women with twin gestations were assigned to weekly intramuscular injections of 250 mg of 17P or matching placebo, starting at 16 to 20 weeks of gestation and ending at 35 weeks. The primary study outcome was delivery or fetal death before 35 weeks of gestation.\nSix hundred sixty-one women were randomly assigned to treatment. Baseline demographic data were similar in the two study groups. Six women were lost to follow-up; data from 655 were analyzed (325 in the 17P group and 330 in the placebo group). Delivery or fetal death before 35 weeks occurred in 41.5% of pregnancies in the 17P group and 37.3% of those in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 1.3). The rate of the prespecified composite outcome of serious adverse fetal or neonatal events was 20.2% in the 17P group and 18.0% in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.5). Side effects of the injections were frequent in both groups, occurring in 65.9% and 64.4% of subjects, respectively (P=0.69), but were generally mild and limited to the injection site.\nTreatment with 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate did not reduce the rate of preterm birth in women with twin gestations.

The extent to which the familial occurrence of coronary heart disease is due to genetic mechanisms can be assessed in twins. In our opinion, due to the chance of mortality risk in monozygotic twin being about 20 times higher than for a representative individual in the overall population, and 3.2- to six-fold higher than for the dizygotic twin of a patient with myocardial infarction, aggressive cardiac evaluation is essential for the asymptomatic twin especially if symptomatic pair's lesion is critical.

Demographic data, medical histories and the results of 24-h urine testing, with samples collected on self-selected diets, were reviewed and analysed.\nThe cystinuric twins had very similar cystine excretion rates, while stone activity was significantly more pronounced in one. Metabolic abnormalities were concordant in one set of twins with calcium oxalate stones, both being hypercalciuric and hyperuricosuric. However, metabolic abnormalities were discordant in the other pair, one twin with hypercalciuria and the other with hypocitraturia. Two of the three pairs had low urinary volume.\nThese results support previous observations that environmental, genetic and potentially, anatomical factors play roles in kidney-stone formation. Additional controlled studies of monozygotic stone-forming twins might help to define the interplay between environmental and genetic factors, and allow the identification of susceptibility genes involved in stone generation.",

We studied 11 people with schizophrenia and their co-twins without manifest disease, using stimulus-induced changes in the magnetoencephalographic approximately 20 Hz rhythm as an index of activation in the motor cortex part of the mirror neuron system. During action observation and execution, motor cortex reaction was weaker in those with schizophrenia than in their co-twins, suggesting a disease-related dysfunction of motor cognition.",

    "abstract": "Affiliation with substance using peers is one of the strongest predictors of adolescent alcohol use. This association is typically interpreted causally: peers who drink incite their friends to drink. This association may be complicated by uncontrolled genetic and environmental confounds because teens with familial predispositions for adolescent substance use may be more likely to select into social networks where drinking is common. We test this alternative hypothesis using a sample of 1,820 twin and sibling pairs, and their same-sex best friends, from three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Across all three waves, peer report of substance use did not influence adolescent alcohol use when genetic and shared environmental predispositions for drinking were considered. The association between alcohol use and peer behavior may be a spurious association attributable to a shared genetic liability to drink alcohol and associate with peers who drink alcohol.",

    "abstract": "To address the role of childhood sun exposure on the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) after controlling for genetic susceptibility, we investigated the association between sun exposure and MS comparing disease-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins.\nTwins with MS were sought by yearly newspaper advertisements throughout North America from 1980 to 1992. Diagnosis was verified by updated medical documentation through 2005. This analysis was restricted to 79 disease- and exposure-discordant monozygotic twin pairs who had ranked themselves before 1993 in relation to each of nine childhood sun exposure activities. A sun exposure index (SI) was defined as the sum of those exposures for which one twin ranked higher than his or her co-twin. The SI difference within each twin pair was calculated by subtracting the SI value of the affected twin from the SI value of the unaffected twin (range -9 to +9). The results were then analyzed using conditional logistic models.\nEach of the nine sun exposure-related activities during childhood seemed to convey a strong protection against MS within MZ twin pairs. Depending on the activity, the odds ratio (OR) ranged from 0.25 to 0.57. For example, the risk of subsequent MS was substantially lower (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.83) for the twin who spent more time suntanning in comparison with the co-twin. For each unit increase in SI, the relative risk of MS decreased by 25%.\nEarly sun avoidance seems to precede the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). This protective effect is independent of genetic susceptibility to MS.",

    "abstract": "In animal models, STAT3 action in the hypothalamus and liver appears essential for normal body weight and glucose homeostasis in response to insulin. We hypothesized that variation in the STAT3 gene may be associated with body fat and/or insulin resistance in the general population. Five tagging SNPs spanning the STAT3 gene, rs8074524, rs2293152, rs2306580, rs6503695, and rs7211777 were genotyped in 2776 white female twins (mean age, 47.4+/-12.5 yrs) from the St Thomas' United Kingdom Adult Twin Registry (Twins UK). Minor allele frequencies were as follows: rs8074524 (0.19), rs2293152 (0.37), rs2306580 (0.06), rs6503695 (0.35), and rs7211777 (0.34). The minor allele of rs2293152 was associated with higher homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (p=0.013) in the full cohort and confirmed in sib-transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT): (p=0.015; n=60). However, there were no associations with fasting serum insulin or glucose or with obesity variables. Although defective STAT3 action results in obesity and insulin resistance in animal models, we failed to establish any indicative associations with common SNPs in this human study.",

We describe a patient with a variant KS (47,X,i(Xq),Y) who has a twin brother with a 46,XY karyotype. Molecular studies showed that the twins were monozygotic. The presence of an isochromosome Xq in one of two monozygotic twins allows precise investigation of its phenotypic effect. The patient was somewhat shorter (3.5 cm) and had a smaller volume of the testes (8 vs. 18 ml) as compared to his twin brother. Furthermore he had increased gonadotrophin levels and an extreme oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT). These data support the view that genes on Xp cause increased body height and genes on Xq cause infertility in KS. To our knowledge this is the first report on a heterokaryotypic monozygotic twin with a variant KS.",

With genetically identical twin as an ideal donor, the majority of SAA patients require appropriate immunosuppression before and after stem cell transplantation to obtain long-term hematopoietic reconstitution. Alkylating agents, used during conditioning, are associated with short- and long-term toxic effects that lead to poor compliance of treatment and could compromise the quality of future life. Three SAA patients, transplanted from genetically identical twins without using alkylating agents during conditioning, showed rapid and sustained hematological reconstitution without any evidence of conditioning-related toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Mammographic density, the light/white radiographic appearance on a mammogram that represents connective and epithelial tissue, is a strong risk factor for breast cancer which seems to be highly heritable. Little is known about its genetic determinants.\nWe studied 457 women from 207 sisterhoods (104 monozygotic twins, 182 dizygotic twins, and 171 singletons). Percentage mammographic density (PMD) as well as dense area and nondense area were calculated using a computer-assisted method. We measured six single nucleotide polymorphisms from six candidate genes (COMT, HSD3B1, IGFBP3, HER2, XPD, and XRCC3). Associations between genotypes and mammographic measures were tested (a) cross-sectionally using a multivariate normal model fitted using FISHER that allowed separate correlations for monozygotic, dizygotic, and nontwin pairs and (b) within sister pairs using paired t tests.\nCross-sectionally, each additional copy of the HSD3B1 Asn(367)Thr variant allele was associated with lower PMD (-3.47% per allele; SE = 1.65; P = 0.035). Within-pair regression estimates confirmed this association. There was no evidence for an association between the mammographic density measures and any of the other variants studied.\nWe have replicated an association between a variant in the HSD3B1 gene and PMD, which suggests that HSD3B1 may be genetic determinant of mammographic density.",

Abnormal cord insertion was observed in 9 (69%) out of the 13 affected infants, and a significant relation was found between the presence of CHD and abnormal cord insertion.\nOf the MC twins, the smaller seemed more likely to be affected by primary structural cardiac anomalies. CHD in MC twins is possibly related to an abnormal cord insertion. Further studies are warranted to determine whether a causal relationship exists.",

    "abstract": "Biological variables in height growth in Japanese singletons are well documented, but there has been less research on Japanese twins.\nThe study investigated the biological variables in height growth of Japanese twins and compared them with those of Japanese singletons.\nSamples of 92 boys and 99 girls from monozygotic twins, and 41 boys and 38 girls from dizygotic twins born in 1960-1973, from the Twin Class in the Junior and Senior High Schools affiliated to the University of Tokyo, Japan, were considered. The Bayes modal estimation method was applied to the triphasic generalized logistic growth model (BTT model). From the fitted model, the biological variables were extracted.\nThe monozygotic twins, on average, matured earlier than dizygotic twins, but later than singletons. Until pre-adolescence, the height velocity of twin children is lower than that of singleton children. This results in the final stature of twin youths being smaller than that of singleton youths. The twins are, on average, about 2.6 cm smaller than singletons in final height only due to the lower velocity during birth to pre-adolescence. Comparing with the average final stature of dizygotic children, the boys were 3.9 cm and the girls were 2.8 cm shorter than Japanese late-maturing boys and girls, respectively. For monozygotic children, the boys were 3.8 cm and the girls were 3.0 cm shorter than the respective Japanese late-matured singleton boys and girls.\nThe biological variables of twins differ significantly from those of singletons. It is important to recognize that singleton reference values do not correctly reflect the growth of twins.",

    "abstract": "The role of genetic factors in the development of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) has been well documented; however, reports of the specific mode of genetic inheritance are inconclusive. These facts, combined with the phenotypic variability of this disorder, suggest that the genetic expression of idiopathic scoliosis may be dependent on multiple factors and genetic interactions. However, it seems questionable whether there is evidence for a genetic aetiology for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, when in monozygotic twins there is no 100% concordance of the symptoms and prognosis.\nFive pairs of monozygotic tested twins with the diagnosis of AIS were presented in the outpatient practice of the author. There was no history of scoliosis in any other member of the family.\nPair 1: Growth is still left in both girls, however prognosis is totally different. The progression factor of the first girl was 1.75 and so she has a risk of >65% for curve progression, Cobb angle 40. Progression factor of the second girl was 0.56 and so she has a risk of <5% for curve progression, Cobb angle 18. Pair 2: Both girls presented with Risser 4. Cobb angle was 55 degrees in one of the twins (progression factor: 3.1; risk for progression >95%) and 220 in the other (progression factor: 0.7; risk for progression <5%). Curve pattern was thoracic in the first, double major in the second girl. Pair 3: Two monozygotic tested boys with similar bad prognoses and similar curve pattern and similar degrees of curvature (90 and 100 degrees). Pair 4: Two not tested girls with similar benign prognoses and similar curve patterns (18 and 22 degrees). Pair 5: Two monozygotic tested girls with different prognoses and similar curve patterns (26 and 49 degrees).\nDifferent curve patterns in two of the five pairs of twins as well as different prognoses can be discussed as phenotypic variability of AIS, however the findings from the other three pairs may be interpreted in the way that genetic factors play a role in the aetiology of AIS.",

    "abstract": "The familial nature of childhood conduct problems has been well documented, but few genetically informed studies have explicitly explored the processes through which parental conduct problems influence an offspring's behavior problems.\nTo delineate the genetic and environmental processes underlying the intergenerational transmission of childhood conduct problems.\nWe used hierarchical linear models to analyze data from a Children of Twins Study, a quasiexperimental design, to explore the extent to which genetic factors common to both generations, unmeasured environmental factors that are shared by twins, or measured characteristics of both parents confound the intergenerational association.\nParticipants were recruited from the community and completed a semistructured diagnostic telephone interview.\nThe research used a high-risk sample of twins, their spouses, and their young adult offspring (n = 2554) from 889 twin families in the Australian Twin Registry, but the analyses used sample weights to produce parameter estimates for the community-based volunteer sample of twins. Main Outcome Measure Number of conduct disorder symptoms.\nThe magnitude of the intergenerational transmission was significant for all offspring, though it was stronger for males (effect size [Cohen d] = 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.17) than females (d = 0.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.14). The use of the Children of Twins design and measured covariates indicated that the intergenerational transmission of conduct problems for male offspring was largely mediated by environmental variables specifically related to parental conduct disorder (d = 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.23). In contrast, the intergenerational transmission of conduct problems was not because of environmentally mediated causal processes for female offspring (d = - 0.09; 95% confidence interval, - 0.20 to 0.03); a common genetic liability accounted for the intergenerational relations.\nThe mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of conduct problems depend on the sex of the offspring. The results are consistent with an environmentally mediated causal role of parental conduct problems on behavior problems in males. Common genetic risk, however, confounds the entire intergenerational transmission in female offspring.",

    "abstract": "Contrast sensitivity is strongly associated with daily functioning among older adults, but the genetic and environmental contributions to this ability are unknown. Using the classical twin method, we addressed this issue by examining contrast sensitivity at five spatial frequencies (1.5-18 cycles per degree) in 718 middle-aged male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). Heritability estimates were modest (14-38%), whereas individual-specific environmental influences accounted for 62-86% of the variance. Identifying the types of individual-specific events that impact contrast sensitivity may suggest interventions to modulate this ability and thereby improve overall quality of life as adults age.",

    "abstract": "Using a unique twin approach, we examined the extent to which birth weight is determined by genetic and nongenetic factors and whether associations between birth weight and measures of glucose metabolism are of genetic or nongenetic origin.\nAn oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in a population-based cohort of twins including 138 same-sex monozygotic (MZ) and 214 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs aged 55-73 years whose birth weight was known. Heritability of birth weight was determined and regression analyses with intra-twin pair differences of birth weight and measures of glucose metabolism, with and without adjustment for adult obesity, were performed.\nThe heritability of birth weight was estimated to be 38%. We demonstrated significant nongenetic associations between birth weight and measures of glucose homeostasis in MZ twins, with a reduction in fasting plasma glucose, 120 min post-OGTT plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin and HOMA-IR index of 15.7%, 25.5%, 26.4% and 37.2%, respectively, for every 1 kg increase in birth weight. The nongenetic negative associations between birth weight and measures of glucose intolerance were independent of adult obesity, whereas the nongenetic association between birth weight and insulin resistance persisted, although not as strongly, after adjusting for current body size.\nWe demonstrated a genetic component to birth weight in elderly twins. When adjusting for this influence, we found a nongenetic negative association between birth weight and glucose tolerance as well as insulin resistance that was partially independent of adult obesity. This implies that the foetal environment influences glucose homeostasis in elderly twins.",

    "abstract": "A pair of thoracopagus conjoined twins were separated at the age of 3 months at Khon Kaen Regional Hospital, Thailand on November 19, 2004. Pre-operative investigations showed separate hearts, joined duodenum, and fusion of the livers. Separation of the extra-hepatic biliary systems was suspected. Operative findings revealed fusion of the intestines from the second part of the duodenum to the terminal ileum with two normal colons. An intussusception was found at the terminal ileum. Fusion of the livers with only one extra-hepatic biliary system was noted In one of the twins, the gastrointestinal tract was anastomosed with Roux-en- Y enteric loop to one area of good bile drainage at the cut surface of liver Post operative course was hectic but both twins recovered satisfactorily. Both are doing well at present, two years after the separation. This was the first reported case of thoracopagus conjoined twins with complex biliary tract anomalies in Thailand. From the literature, pre-operative investigations in most cases of these conjoined twins failed to define the precise anatomy of the biliary system and may be misleading as in the presented case. The mortality rate remains high. Meticulous pre-operative planning, decision-making in the operative field and postoperative management as well as a multidisciplinary team are very important for a successful separation.",

    "abstract": "Although parental divorce is associated with increased substance use and internalizing problems, experiencing the separation of one's parents may not cause these outcomes. The relations may be due to genetic or environmental selection factors, characteristics that lead to both marital separation and offspring functioning.\nWe used the Children of Twins (CoT) Design to explore whether unmeasured genetic or environmental factors related to the twin parent, and measured characteristics of both parents, account for the association between parental divorce and offspring substance use and internalizing problems.\nThe association between parental divorce and offspring substance use problems remained robust when controlling for genetic and environmental risk from the twin parent associated with parental divorce, and measured characteristics of both parents. The results do not prove, but are consistent with, a causal connection. In contrast, the analyses suggest that shared genetic liability in parents and their offspring accounts for the increased risk of internalizing problems in adult offspring from divorced families.\nThe study illustrates that unmeasured genetic and environmental selection factors must be considered when studying parental divorce. In explaining associations between parental divorce and young-adult adjustment, our evidence suggests that selection versus causal mechanisms may operate differently for substance abuse (a causal relation) and internalizing problems (an artifact of selection). The CoT design only controls for the genetic and environmental characteristics of one parent; thus, additional genetically informed analyses are needed.",

    "abstract": "The birth of conjoined twins occurs in approximately 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 deliveries, and the majority are either stillborn or die early in life. Approximately 184 successful separations have been described. The authors describe the preoperative radiologic evaluation of a set of thoracopagus-omphalopagus twins and their successful surgical separation. Preoperative radiologic imaging demonstrated that the twins did not share myocardium, but an ectopic cordis was present. The inferior vena cavae entered the right atria at more acute angles than normal. The liver was fused, two gallbladders were present, and there was a large bridging portal vein that crossed the hepatic isthmus of one twin to the conjoined twin's portal venous system. Replaced hepatic arteries originated from the superior mesenteric arteries. Each twin had separate kidneys, colons, and rectums. Preoperative tissue expansion was necessary, and the twins were separated at 5 1/2 months of life. Successful separation of twins conjoined by several organ systems requires a multispecialty approach. Preoperative knowledge of shared anatomy is necessary for adequate preparation and planning. Despite meticulous preoperative investigations, certain anatomy can only be discovered at the time of surgery, and the ability to adjust to these findings is imperative.",

    "abstract": "Despite the known influence of orthodontic treatment on facial appearance, there have been few comparative studies of the effect of different treatments, and none of these appear to have looked at the long-term consequences. This study compared the effect of traditional fixed appliances and orthotropic (growth guidance) treatment without fixed appliances on a series of 12 identical twins, 10 years after treatment. Facial changes were assessed by a panel of 12 lay judges. A comparison was also made of the dental changes and an error study undertaken. The results showed that most of the traditionally treated twins were judged to look less attractive after treatment, while most treated by orthotropics were judged to have improved. There was little difference in the dental results, but the traditionally treated cases seemed to relapse more frequently.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop a method to generate identical twins and triplets with predicted gender. As a first step toward that aim, single blastomeres obtained from EGFP expressing eight-cell stage embryos and either diploid or tetraploid host embryos were used to compose chimera. We could follow the fate of EGFP expressing diploid blastomere derived cells in 3.5- and 4.5-day-old chimera embryos in vitro. We found that the diploid blastomere-derived cells had significantly higher chance to contribute to the inner cell mass if tetraploid host embryos were applied. After that, we developed a quick and reliable multiplex PCR strategy for sex diagnosis from single blastomeres by simultaneous amplification of the homologous ZFX and ZFY genes. By composed chimeras using single blastomeres, derived from sexed eight-cell stage embryos and a tetraploid host embryo, we could get preplanned sex newborns, wholly derived from these blastomeres. Among these mice, identical twins and a triplet were identified by microsatellite analysis. Unlike clones produced by nuclear transfer, these mice are identical at both the nuclear as well as mitochondrial DNA level. Therefore, the tetraploid embryo complementation method to produce monozygotic twins and triplets could be a valuable tool both in biomedical and agricultural applications.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, including humans, female fetuses that are exposed to testosterone from adjacent male fetuses in utero can have masculinized anatomy and behavior. However, the reproductive consequences of such prebirth sex-ratio effects for offspring and their implications for maternal fitness remain unexplored. Here we investigate the effects of being gestated with a male co-twin for daughter lifetime reproductive success, and the fitness consequences for mothers of producing mixed-sex twins in preindustrial (1734-1888) Finns. We show that daughters born with a male co-twin have reduced lifetime reproductive success compared to those born with a female co-twin. This reduction arises because such daughters have decreased probabilities of marrying as well as reduced fecundity. Mothers who produce opposite-sex twins consequently have fewer grandchildren (and hence lower fitness) than mothers who produce same-sex twins. Our results are unlikely to be a consequence of females born with male co-twins receiving less nutrition because such females do not have reduced survival and increases in food availability fail to improve their reproductive success. Nor are our results explained by after-birth social factors (females growing up with similarly aged brothers) because females born with a male co-twin have reduced success even when their co-twin dies shortly after birth and are raised as singletons after birth. Our findings suggest that hormonal interactions between opposite-sex fetuses known to influence female morphology and behavior can also have negative effects on daughter fecundity and, hence, maternal fitness, and bear significant implications for adaptive sex allocation in mammals.",

    "abstract": "In orthodontics and dentofacial orthopaedics, where genetic and environmental factors interpenetrate from the early stages of development, the clinician tries to determine how mechanics could influence patient's growth pattern. Comparing monozygotic and dizygotic twins, in their similarities and their differences, gives some answers... but raises some questions too. In this article, we gather some clinical studies and case reports, on diagnosis and treatment aspects of malocclusions.",

    "abstract": "Proper functioning of the male reproductive axis depends on complex feedback systems between several hormones. In this study, the genetic contribution of various endocrine components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is evaluated and previously observed differences in FSH and inhibin B levels between mono- (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins are re-investigated.\nInhibin B, FSH, LH, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and testosterone levels were assayed in 128 adult males (20 MZ twin pairs, 7 single MZ twins, 10 DZ twin pairs, 27 single DZ twins and 34 siblings of twins, constituting 10 sibling pairs), aged 15.6-68.7 years. Hormone levels were compared across zygosity groups and heritability estimates were obtained using maximum likelihood variance component analysis.\nHeritability estimates ranged from 56% (testosterone) to 81% (inhibin B and SHBG). For LH and FSH, the heritability was estimated at 68% and 80% respectively. No mean differences in hormone levels were observed across groups.\nAll measured hormones are highly heritable. A difference in the FSH-inhibin B feedback system between DZ twin males and MZ twin males could not be confirmed.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune polyglandular syndromes (APS 1 and 2 types) are the primary defeat of the autoimmune process of two or more peripheral endocrine glands, usually leading to their functional failure and often combined with variousthe genogenic (Mendelian) nature of inheritance, when the autoimmune process in the endocrine and non-endocrine organs is caused by a mutation of a single AIRE gene (autoimmune regulator). Earlier, we published a case report of type 1 APS in a patient of 8 years old. Now she is 10 years. 1.5 years after the illness of this girl, a similar diagnosis was made to her twin sister.

    "abstract": "Surveys have shown opposition to human reproductive cloning (HRC) in many countries. Views of identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins are of particular interest, as they naturally share 100% of their genes. We investigated attitudes of British twins towards HRC in the context of assisted reproduction technologies (ART) and gene selection.\nAbout 4651 identical and non-identical (dizygotic, DZ) twins expressed their degree of agreement or disagreement to nine statements relating to ART, gene selection and HRC in a self-completion questionnaire.\nMost subjects (70% and 78% respectively) did not regard the use of medical technologies to treat infertility as interfering with either nature or God's will, despite believing that infertility is not a disease (54%). Attitudes to gene selection and HRC were context dependent, with more favourable views towards preventing serious diseases than towards enhancing traits. About 44% supported a permanent ban of HRC. MZ twins were significantly more likely to agree that HRC should be allowed for medical purposes, such as saving a sibling's life, than were DZ twins. Increasing religiosity generally correlated with more negative attitudes.\nMany attitudes are context dependent. More positive views of MZ twins towards HRC could be linked to their experience with being genetically identical.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed using population-based data to analyze whether motor development in early life is different between singletons and twins in Japan. For better comparison and investigation, we divided the 2 groups into a group with a birthweight of 2.5 kg or greater (subgroup A) and a group with a birthweight of less than 2.5 kg (subgroup B), respectively. We analyzed the database of medical check-ups for children aged 3 years between April 2001 and July 2004. They received medical checkups at 4 months, 1.5, and 3 years of age. Children who were suspected of having neurological abnormality or disability were referred to specialists and excluded from the database. The data of 14,132 children were analyzed. Among these, 13,040 (92.3%) children were singletons in subgroup A, 75 (0.5%) were twins in subgroup A, 866 (6.1%) were singletons in subgroup B and 151 (1.1%) were twins in subgroup B. The mean age at achieving milestones was slower in twins of subgroup A for each developmental outcome than singletons of subgroup A, and the difference between twins and singletons was significant after adjustment for rolling over. On the contrary, after adjusting for a confounding factor (gestational age), singletons of subgroup B attained motor development facilitating walking independently slower than twins of subgroup B. There were different tendencies in the results regarding the motor development of subjects of subgroup A and that of subjects of subgroup B.",

    "abstract": "While evidence supporting for nonadditive genetic influences on personality traits in Caucasian populations has been growing in recent years, twin studies that explored the existence of genetic nonadditivity in personality variation in Asian populations are still lacking. Seven hundred and sixty-five pairs of adolescent and young adult twins registered with the South Korean Twin Registry completed the 7 scales of the Eysenck Personality Scales through a mail survey. Maximum likelihood twin correlations were computed and model-fitting analyses were conducted. Monozygotic twin correlations were consistently higher than twice the dizygotic twin correlations for all 7 scales, suggesting pervasive influences of nonadditive genetic effects on personality traits in the South Korean population. Model-fitting analyses indicated that genetic nonadditivity is particularly important for the variation of Impulsivity, Venturesomeness, Empathy, Lie, and Psychoticism. According to the best fitting models, nonadditive genetic effects ranged from 34 to 49% for these scales. For Neuroticism and Extraversion, models that included an additive genetic component fit better than those including a nonadditive genetic variance component.",

    "abstract": "In previous studies we obtained evidence that variation in loneliness has a genetic component. Based on adult twin data, the heritability estimate for loneliness, which was assessed as an ordinal trait, was 48%. These analyses were done on loneliness scores averaged over items ('I feel lonely' and 'Nobody loves me') and over time points. In this article we present a longitudinal analysis of loneliness data assessed in 5 surveys (1991 through 2002) in Dutch twins (N = 8389) for the two separate items of the loneliness scale. From the longitudinal growth modeling it was found sufficient to have non-zero variance for the intercept only, while the other effects (linear, quadratic and cubic slope) had zero variance. For the item 'I feel lonely' we observed an increasing age trend up to age 30, followed by a decline to age 50. Heritability for individual differences in the intercept was estimated at 77%. For the item 'Nobody loves me' no significant trend over age was seen; the heritability of the intercept was estimated at 70%.",

    "abstract": "Although social and intellectual engagement have been consistently associated with late-life functioning, rather than true causation, these associations may reflect the experiential choices of high functioning individuals (i.e., selection effects). We investigated the association of social activity with late-life physical functioning, cognitive functioning, and depression symptomatology using data from 1112 pairs of like-sex twins who participated in the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins. Consistent with previous research, we found that social activity was significantly correlated with overall level of physical functioning, cognitive functioning, and depression symptomatology. We also found that social activity was significantly and moderately heritable (estimate of .36), raising the possibility that its association with late-life functioning might reflect selection processes. Further, social activity did not predict change in functioning and in monozygotic twin pairs discordant on level of social activity, the more socially active twin was not less susceptible to age decreases in physical and cognitive functioning and increases in depression symptomatology than the less socially active twin. These results are interpreted in the context of the additional finding that nonshared environmental factors, although apparently not social activity, are the predominant determinant of changes in late-life functioning.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to examine the neonatal outcome of second twins depending on presentation and mode of delivery. Using a database we analyzed the short-term neonatal outcome in twin pregnancies offered a trial of labor with special emphasis on the second twin depending on presentation and mode of delivery. Neonatal outcome was evaluated by Apgar scores, umbilical cord blood pH values, and perinatal or neonatal morbidity and mortality. Overall, in 219 (78%) of 281 pregnancies successful vaginal birth (VB) of both twins (VB-VB) was possible, 48 (17%) women had to be delivered by cesarean section (CS) of both twins (CS-CS), and in 14 (5%) women the second twin had to be delivered by CS after VB of the first twin (VB-CS). Successful VB was most common for vertex-vertex (V/V; n=171, 82%) and vertex-nonvertex (n=48, 75%) presentation (V/NV). Twins delivered by VB-CS had the lowest values for pHart (p=.006) and pHven (p=.010). pHart less than or equal to 7.00 values occurred only in second twins delivered VB-VB or VB-CS. Lower Apgar scores of the second twin occurred more frequently in the VB-CS and in the VB-VB than in the CS-CS groups (ps<.05). Lower levels of pHart (p=.002) and frequency of pHart less than or equal to 7.00 occurred more often in nonvertex second twins than in vertex second twins (p<.022). The high CS rate in V/NV presentation and the significantly worse perinatal short-term outcome of NV second twins after VB of the first twin underline that randomized studies are necessary to evaluate the best delivery mode for V/NV twins.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most frequent neurocutaneous disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. Phenotype variability is high ranging from merely several caf\u00e9-au-lait spots to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors or severe disfigurement through plexiform neurofibromas. Identification of genetic factors that modify the NF1 phenotype would contribute to the understanding of NF1 pathophysiology and improve patient counselling. As even monozygotic (MZ) twins with NF1 may differ phenotypically, we wondered whether these variations might be inherited in a non-Mendelian fashion. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited extrachromosomally through the cytoplasm of the oocyte and often harbours heteroplasmic sequence variations. At the time of blastomere separation, these variants may be skewedly distributed and effect phenotypic differences. Because of their co-localization with the tumor suppressor protein neurofibromin, which is mutated in NF1, mitochondria were particular attractive candidates for investigation. MtDNA was extracted from nucleated blood cells of four pairs of discordant MZ twins with NF1 and from cutaneous neurofibromas of one twin pair. We sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome and determined the state of heteroplasmy by investigating a microsatellite region of the mitochondrial D-loop (D310-tract). The clinical diagnosis was confirmed in all patients by detection of pathogenic mutations in the NF1 gene. Monozygosity was verified by genotyping. However, we did not detect evidence for mtDNA sequence differences or for different degrees of heteroplasmy between individuals of the same twin pair. The phenotypic discordance of MZ twins with NF1 cannot be explained by skewed distribution of mtDNA mutations or polymorphisms.",

    "abstract": "Girls who report first sexual intercourse during their early teen years have much higher rates of teenage pregnancy and childbearing than girls who delay sexual onset until older adolescence. In this study, we examine genetic and environmental influences on variation in teenage pregnancy and covariation with age at first sexual intercourse in two cohorts of Australian female twins. In the older twin cohort, born 1893-1964, we observe substantial heritable variation in teenage pregnancy that is largely shared with heritable variation in age at first sexual intercourse, with shared environment contributing little to variation in teenage pregnancy. Genetic influences on teenage pregnancy are smaller and nonsignificant in the younger twin cohort, born 1964-1971, where shared environment contributes much more and overlaps entirely with shared environmental variation in age at first intercourse.",

    "abstract": "Twin cohorts provide a unique advantage for investigations of the role of genetics and environment in the etiology of variation in common complex traits by reducing the variance due to environment, age, and cohort differences. The GenomEUtwin (http://www.genomeutwin.org) consortium consists of eight twin cohorts (Australian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Italian, Norwegian, Swedish, and United Kingdom) with the total resource of hundreds of thousands of twin pairs. We performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of one of the most heritable human complex traits, adult stature (body height) using genome-wide scans performed for 3,817 families (8,450 individuals) derived from twin cohorts from Australia, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, and United Kingdom with an approximate ten-centimorgan microsatellite marker map. The marker maps for different studies differed and they were combined and related to the sequence positions using software developed by us, which is publicly available (https://apps.bioinfo.helsinki.fi/software/cartographer.aspx). Variance component linkage analysis was performed with age, sex, and country of origin as covariates. The covariate adjusted heritability was 81% for stature in the pooled dataset. We found evidence for a major QTL for human stature on 8q21.3 (multipoint logarithm of the odds 3.28), and suggestive evidence for loci on Chromosomes X, 7, and 20. Some evidence of sex heterogeneity was found, however, no obvious female-specific QTLs emerged. Several cohorts contributed to the identified loci, suggesting an evolutionarily old genetic variant having effects on stature in European-based populations. To facilitate the genetic studies of stature we have also set up a website that lists all stature genome scans published and their most significant loci (http://www.genomeutwin.org/stature_gene_map.htm).",

    "abstract": "We present a 30-year-old woman with a twin pregnancy, 1 fetus displaying a small head circumference, semilobar holoprosencephaly, and cleft lip as detected by ultrasound at 23 weeks of gestation. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of semilobar holoprosencephaly. The other twin, however, had an appropriate fetal growth, devoid of any major structural anomalies. Karyotyping by G-banding of amniocentesis specimens in both fetuses showed 47,XY,+mar. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed in the marker chromosome positive dicentric signals for the chromosome 15 centromere-specific alpha satellite DNA probe (D15Z1) and negative signals for the SNRPN probe (15q11-13), thus establishing a cytogenetic diagnosis of 47,XX,+mar.ish idic(15)(q11-q13)(D15Z1++,SNRPN-) for both fetuses. The parental karyotypes were normal. The fetuses, therefore, had a de novo inv dup(15) marker chromosome without involvement of the Prader-Willi region. Short tandem repeat markers (total 15 markers) confirmed that the fetuses were monozygotic twins. Short tandem repeat markers at the 15q region (total 6 markers) excluded the possibility of uniparental disomy (15) mat or uniparental disomy (15) pat. Molecular study in both fetuses of TGIF, SHH, SIX3, and ZIC2 genes revealed a heterozygous 1085 C > T (Ser 362 Leu) on the SHH gene, but a homozygous 1085 C > C (Ser 362 Ser) for both parents on the SHH gene. The couple decided to terminate the pregnancy at 26 weeks of gestation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of semilobar holoprosencephaly with inv dup(15) marker chromosome and missense SHH gene mutation 1085 C > T (Ser 362 Leu).",

    "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been associated with altered amounts of slow wave sleep, which could reflect reduced delta electroencephalograph (EEG) activity and impaired sleep regulation. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined the response to a sleep regulatory challenge in CFS.\nThe first of 3 consecutive nights of study served as laboratory adaptation. Baseline sleep was assessed on the second night. On the third night, bedtime was delayed by 4 hours, followed by recovery sleep. Total available sleep time was held constant on all nights.\nA research sleep laboratory.\n13 pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for CFS.\nN/A.\nPower spectral analysis quantified slow wave activity (SWA) in the 0.5-3.9 Hz band in successive NREM periods (stage 2, 3, or 4) on each night. To ensure comparability, analyses were restricted to the first 4 NREM periods on each night. Data were coded for NREM period and twin pair. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) contrasted sleep delay effects across NREM periods between twin pairs. A second ANOVA calculated the SWA in each NREM period in recovery sleep relative to baseline SWA. The 2 groups of twins were similar on baseline SWA power. After sleep delay, CFS twins exhibited significantly less SWA power in the first NREM period of recovery sleep and accumulated a smaller percentage of SWA in the first NREM period than their co-twins.\nCFS is associated with a blunted SWA response to sleep challenge, suggesting that the basic sleep drive and homeostatic response are impaired.",

    "abstract": "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is caused by expansions of the poly (A) binding protein 2 (PABP2) gene. Previous histological analyses have revealed mitochondrial abnormalities in the muscles of OPMD patients but their significance remains uncertain.\nWe had the rare opportunity to study monozygotic twins with identical expansions of the PABP2 gene but with markedly different severities of OPMD. Both had histological features of mitochondrial myopathy. We determined whether mitochondrial DNA abnormalities underlay these changes.\nClinical information was obtained by history and examination. Muscle biopsies were obtained from each subject and genetic analysis was performed using long-range PCR and Southern blotting.\nWe demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions by Southern blotting in individuals with OPMD. This correlates with the presence of mitochondrial myopathy in both twins. Moreover, both twins had different mtDNA deletions, which might explain their phenotypic differences.\nWe hypothesise that mitochondrial dysfunction may occur as a consequence of PABP2 gene mutations, and that this dysfunction may affect the phenotypic manifestations of OPMD.",

    "abstract": "Genetic association studies are becoming commonplace due to the availability of cost-effective yet sophisticated DNA sequencing and genotyping resources and technologies. In addition, technologies designed to identify molecular and subclinical phenotypes that reflect disease pathogenesis are continually being developed and refined (consider, e.g., imaging technologies, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic platforms, histological analyses of excised tissues, etc.). Unfortunately, the large-scale use of many of these molecular and subclinical phenotyping technologies in genetic association studies is difficult logistically and is currently cost-prohibitive. In this paper, we consider efficient designs for testing the association between particular genetic variations and expensive, yet appropriate, subclinical phenotypes of relevance to a disease that take advantage of twins or sibling pairs discordant for genotypes at the locus (or loci) being tested. We demonstrate that including genotypically discordant twins or siblings in an association study can result in a substantial increase in power over designs that use monozygotic twins or only unrelated individuals. We ultimately argue that, from a practical standpoint, sampling from existing family or twin-based cohorts in which: (1) follow-up studies of a genetic association are warranted in order to assess the in vivo significance of an association with respect to more refined pathological phenotypes; and/or (2) large-scale, genome-wide linkage and association studies have been pursued that have focused on clinical endpoints for which the study subjects have consented to more elaborate follow-up studies, is a powerful way to test associations.",

    "abstract": "The significant worldwide health burden introduced by tobacco smoking highlights the importance of studying the genetic determinants of smoking behavior and the key factor sustaining compulsive smoking, that is, nicotine dependence (ND). We have here addressed the genetic background of smoking in a special study sample of twins, harmonized for early life events and specifically ascertained for smoking from the nationwide twin cohort of the genetically unique population of Finland. The twins and their families were carefully examined for extensive phenotype profiles and a genome-wide scan was performed to identify loci behind the smoking status, ND and the comorbid phenotype of ND and alcohol use in 505 individuals from 153 families. We replicated previous linkage findings on 10q (max logarithm of the odds (LOD) 3.12) for a smoker phenotype, and on 7q and 11p (max LOD 2.50, and 2.25, respectively) for the ND phenotype. The loci linked for ND also showed evidence for linkage for the comorbid phenotype. Our study provides confirmatory evidence for the involvement of these genome regions in the genetic etiology of smoking behavior and ND and for the first time associates drinking and smoking to a shared locus on 10q.",

    "abstract": "The heart rate response to nicotine may be an important component of the process leading to dependence. The present study is the first to determine the extent to which genetic and environmental sources play a role in various components of the heart rate response. One hundred and ten monozygotic and 29 dizygotic twin pairs received an i.v. infusion of nicotine and cotinine over 30 min. Before, during, and for 30 min after infusion, heart rate was measured via an electronic monitor. The clearance of nicotine was determined as a measure of the rate of nicotine metabolism. Average resting heart rate before infusion was 64.7 beats per minutes (bpm), and at the termination of infusion, heart rate had increased to an average of 72.7 bpm. At 30 min after infusion, heart rate had decreased to 67.5 bpm. Age, current smoking status, body mass index, and nicotine clearance were associated significantly with heart rate levels over the full 60 min of measurement. After adjustment for several covariates, including dose of administered nicotine and rate of nicotine clearance, the variance in several characteristics of the heart rate response curve was examined for the relative contribution from genetic and environmental sources. In the total sample, as much as 30.3% of the variance in the acceleration of heart rate was due to additive genetic sources. In nonsmokers, 34.8% and 31.0% of variance in the acceleration and deceleration of heart rate, respectively, was due to genetic sources. Heart rate acceleration and deceleration may be a reflection of central nervous system responsiveness to nicotine. The contribution from genetic sources to heart rate response characteristics should be investigated further as a potential endophenotype for use in genetic studies of nicotine dependence.",

    "abstract": "This case report demonstrates the use of ultrasound and doppler flow in the management of mono-amniotic monochorionic (M/M) twins. M/M twinning is a rare but significant event. It is associated with high rates of fetal mortality, most commonly cited at anywhere from between 30% and 70%. A common cause of death is cord entanglement. The case presented is that of a 19-year-old gravida 1 at 30 weeks with M/M twins in which multiple cord knots were found by ultrasound color doppler flow after variable fetal heart rate decelerations occurred. This prompted a decision for immediate cesarean delivery with normal fetal outcomes. Improvements in perinatal imaging systems are therefore beneficial in the management of M/M twins.",

    "abstract": "Early loss of one fetus in a multiple gestation as a 'vanishing' twin is a well recognized phenomenon. It is uncertain whether this has an impact on the development of the surviving co-twin. The aim of this study is to compare the development of singletons, twins and the surviving co-twins of a vanishing twin. The 324 children born to 229 women who were recruited into the study between 1999 and 2001 formed the study population. Children were assessed at 1 year of age with Griffiths Mental and Developmental Scales. A neurological examination was performed using an optimality score to exclude those with severe neurodisability. Three hundred and five children (92 singletons, 180 twins and 33 survivors with a vanishing twin) were included. The sub- and general quotient scores in singletons and surviving co-twins of a vanishing twin did not differ significantly. Twins had significantly lower scores than singletons in all areas of development and were more likely to be born early with lower birthweights. Following adjustment for gestation and birthweight, the difference between the two groups was nullified suggesting that the slower development of twins is related to their prematurity and lower birthweight.",

    "abstract": "Plasma lipids such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol and triglyceride levels contribute to variation in the risk of cardiovascular disease. The early stages of atherosclerosis in childhood have also been associated with changes in triglycerides, LDL and HDL. Heritability estimates for lipids and lipoproteins for adolescents are in the range .71 to .82, but little is known about changes of genetic and environmental influences over time in adolescence. We have investigated the contribution of genetic and environmental influences to variation in lipids in adolescent twins and their nontwin siblings using longitudinal twin and family data. Plasma HDL and LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides data from 965 twin pairs at 12, 14 and 16 years of age and their siblings have been analyzed. Longitudinal genetic models that included effects of age, sex and their interaction were fitted to assess whether the same or different genes influence each trait at different ages. Results suggested that more than one genetic factor influences HDL, LDL, total cholesterol and triglycerides over time at ages 12, 14 and 16 years. There was no evidence of shared environmental effects except for HDL and little evidence of long-term nonshared environmental effects was found. Our study suggested that there are developmental changes in the genes affecting plasma lipid concentrations across adolescence.",

    "abstract": "A previous publication reported the etiology of mathematics performance in 7-year-old twins (Oliver et al., 2004). As part of the same longitudinal study we investigated low mathematics performance and normal variation in a representative United Kingdom sample of 1713 same-sex 9-year-old twins based on teacher-assessed National Curriculum standards. Univariate individual differences and DeFries-Fulker extremes analyses were performed. Similar to our results at 7 years, all mathematics scores at 9 years showed high heritability (.62-.75) and low shared environmental estimates (.00-.11) for both the low performance group and the full sample. Longitudinal analyses were performed from 7 to 9 years. These longitudinal analyses indicated strong genetic continuity from 7 to 9 years for both low performance and mathematics in the normal range. We conclude that, despite the considerable differences in mathematics curricula from 7 to 9 years, the same genetic effects largely operate at the two ages.",

    "abstract": "The Twins' Early Development Study (TEDS) is a large-scale longitudinal study of twins from early childhood through adolescence. Since its conception, TEDS has had as its focus the study of problematic development within the context of normal variation, mainly in the development of language, cognitive and academic abilities and behavior problems from multivariate quantitative and molecular genetic perspectives. TEDS twins have been assessed at 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10 and (currently) 12 years of age, and DNA collected from more than 12,000 children. Identified from birth records of twins born in the United Kingdom between 1994 and 1996, more than 15,000 pairs of twins originally enrolled in TEDS, and well over 13,000 pairs--representative of the U.K. population--remain involved in the study to date. Similar to many other twin and adoption studies, TEDS data indicate that both genetic and environmental influences are important in nearly all areas of behavioral development. Multivariate genetic analyses allow researchers to go beyond this basic nature-nurture question, and TEDS results suggest that, especially in the area of learning abilities and disabilities, genes are generalists and environments are specialists. That is, genes largely contribute to similarity in performance within and between learning abilities and disabilities and across age, whereas the environment contributes to differences in performance. Quantitative genetic findings such as these chart the course for molecular genetic research. The TEDS dataset is proving valuable in genome-wide association research that tries to identify some of the many genes responsible for the ubiquitous heritability of behavior.",

    "abstract": "The Nonshared Environment in Adolescent Development (NEAD) project is a longitudinal study of twins/siblings and parents that has been assessed 3 times: middle adolescence, late adolescence and young adulthood (N=720 families at Time 1). Siblings varied in degree of genetic relatedness including identical twins, fraternal twins, full siblings, half siblings and genetically unrelated (or step) siblings. There were also two family types: nondivorced and step. A multimeasure, multirater approach was taken in NEAD, with data collected from all participants (2 twins or siblings, mother and father) as well as from coded videotaped observations of family interactions. Detailed assessments of family relationships, adolescent adjustment and competence were collected at all 3 times. The original aim of NEAD was to identify systematic sources of nonshared environmental influences that contribute to differences among family members. Although systematic sources of nonshared environmental influences were not found in NEAD, three major sets of findings emerged: (1) genetic influences on family relationships and on associations between family relationships and adolescent adjustment; (2) genetic and environmental influences on adolescent adjustment, comorbidity and stability and change in adolescent adjustment from middle to late adolescence; and (3) genetic influences on relationships outside the family.",

The Cardiff Study of All Wales and North West of England Twins (CaStANET) has followed children and adolescents over time into early adulthood, assessing a wide range of aspects of behavior and psychopathology using self-, parent and teacher reports. Four main waves of data collection have taken place to date, which have provided a wealth of information on the contributions of genetic and environmental risk factors to the psychological health of young people. This article first describes the CaStANET register and subsequently presents some of the findings that have emerged from this resource, with a focus on depression and anxiety, chronic fatigue, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct problems and prosocial behavior. We describe in somewhat more detail the 4th wave of data collection, which has recently been completed and has provided us with extensive information on substance use and problem use as well as associated risk factors in the twins and their families, including longitudinal data on conduct problems and the relations between family members. Because of the wealth of data already collected and the opportunity for genetically informative analyses over time, CaStANET provides a valuable resource for understanding the complexities of the psychological development of young people.",

    "abstract": "We analysed genetic and environmental influences on self-esteem and its stability in adolescence.\nFinnish twins born in 1983-1987 were assessed by questionnaire at ages 14 (n = 4132 twin individuals) and 17 years (n = 3841 twin individuals). Self-esteem was measured using the Rosenberg global self-esteem scale and analyzed using quantitative genetic methods for twin data in the Mx statistical package.\nThe heritability of self-esteem was 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56-0.68] in 14-year-old boys and 0.40 (95% CI 0.26-0.54) in 14-year-old girls, while the corresponding estimates at age 17 were 0.48 (95% CI 0.39-0.56) and 0.29 (95% CI 0.11-0.45). Rosenberg self-esteem scores at ages 14 and 17 were modestly correlated (r = 0.44 in boys, r = 0.46 in girls). In boys, the correlation was mainly (82%) due to genetic factors, with residual co-variation due to unique environment. In girls, genetic (31%) and common environmental (61%) factors largely explained the correlation.\nIn adolescence, self-esteem seems to be differently regulated in boys versus girls. A key challenge for future research is to identify environmental influences contributing to self-esteem during adolescence and determine how these factors interact with genetic influences.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is suspected to exert antiatherogenic, antiinflammatory, and insulin-sensitizing effects. However, the relative importance of the genetic and environmental factors in influencing plasma adiponectin levels (ADPN) remains unclear.\nThe aim of the study was to investigate whether ADPN and body mass index (BMI) are genetically determined.\nIn a series of 60 pairs of healthy twins, we estimated genetic variance and heritability of ADPN and BMI using both ANOVA and path analysis methods. Twins were genotyped at two biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the gene encoding adiponectin: the +45 T/G (on exon 2) and the -11377 G/C (on the promoter).\nA total of 30 pairs of twins were Monozygotic (MZ), and 30 were dizygotic (DZ). The mean ADPN (+/-SD) was 10.6 +/- 5.7 in MZ and 11.1 +/- 4.5 in DZ twins (nonsignificant). Three tests of heritability (within pair = 1.13, P < 0.0001; among components = 1.62, P = 0.005; and intraclass correlation 1.34, P < 0.0001) consistently showed ADPN heritability. The preferred model of a likelihood-based analysis included an additive genetic influence and an individually unique environmental influence for ADPN, accounting for 88% and 12% of ADPN variance, respectively. We found a significantly higher within-pair difference of ADPN in DZ than in MZ pairs, and in +45 T/G SNP discordant compared with concordant DZ twins, indicating a significant effect of this adiponectin gene SNP on ADPN.\nADPN shows significant genetic variance and heritability, which is independent of BMI and partly accounted for by the +45 T/G, but not the -11377 G/C adiponectin gene SNP.",

Apart from its essential role in B cell development, Btk is indicated to affect signaling mediated by toll like receptors (TLRs) and development of dendritic cells (DCs) but results are conflictive. The twins revealed normal numbers of plasmacytoid and myeloid DCs (pDCs and mDCs). Moreover, BTK null cells from these patients exhibited robust responses to TLR agonists, normal natural killer (NK) cell activity, and normal pDC functions.\nOur results do not indicate the essential role of Btk in TLR signaling and DC development.",

    "abstract": "Studies have found associations between low birth weight and increased risks of cardiovascular diseases in adulthood. However, these associations could be due to confounding by genetic or socioeconomic factors.\nWe performed a study on Swedish like-sexed twins with known zygosity who were born from 1926 to 1958. First, to obtain an overall effect of birth weight on risk of hypertension, we performed cohort analyses on all twins (n=16,265). Second, to address genetic and shared environmental confounding, we performed a nested co-twin control analysis within 594 dizygotic and 250 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for hypertension. Birth characteristics, including birth weight, were obtained from original birth records. Information from adulthood was collected from a postal questionnaire in 1973 (body mass index, height, smoking, and alcohol use) and from a telephone interview conducted from 1998 to 2002 (hypertension and socioeconomic status). Hypertension was defined as reporting both high blood pressure and treatment with antihypertensive medication. In the cohort analysis, the adjusted odds ratio for hypertension in relation to a 500-g decrease in birth weight was 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 1.61). In the co-twin control analyses, the corresponding odds ratios were 1.34 (95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.69) for dizygotic and 1.74 (95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 2.70) for monozygotic twins.\nIn the largest twin study on the fetal origins of hypertension, we found that decreased birth weight is associated with increased risk of hypertension independently of genetic factors, shared familial environment, and risk factors for hypertension in adulthood, including body mass index.",

Furthermore, few of these studies have examined differences in individuals with an onset during childhood or adolescence. This study examined amygdala volume and its potential association with early onset major depression.\nA community-based sample of 47 right-handed young adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs was examined. For 29 twin pairs, one twin per pair had a lifetime history of MDD, while 18 age-matched control twin pairs had no lifetime history of MDD or other Axis I disorder. Core, noncore, and total amygdala volumes were estimated based on a combination of manual tracing, automated segmentation, and expert rater regional boundary definitions.\nNo significant differences were found in amygdala volumes between depressed, high-risk, or control subjects. However, analyses comparing control monozygotic twins to randomly created control subject pairs suggest that there are familial, perhaps genetic, influences on core and total amygdala volumes.\nFindings suggest that although there were no significant differences in amygdala volumes between groups, familial factors influence amygdala volumes. Discrepancies between studies measuring amygdala volume in MDD may be due to differences in amygdala boundary definitions.",

    "abstract": "A significant subgroup of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibits chronic, unremitting symptomatology that has also been associated with smaller hippocampal volume. The hippocampus plays a significant role in configural processing of contextual cues that facilitates context-appropriate extinction of conditioned fear. We test the hypothesis that hippocampus-based configural processing deficits are a pre-existing vulnerability factor for unremitting forms of PTSD.\nParticipants included male monozygotic twin pairs who were discordant for combat trauma. In 18 twin pairs the combat-exposed brother developed unremitting PTSD, whereas in 23 pairs the combat-exposed brother never developed PTSD. Participants were compared in the capacity to solve allocentric spatial processing tasks, and this performance was examined for its relationship to the severity of PTSD symptomatology and hippocampal volume.\nAlthough not completely differentiated from overall IQ, PTSD combat veterans demonstrated significantly impaired performance in configural processing relative to non-PTSD combat veterans. Despite having neither combat-exposure nor PTSD, the unexposed co-twins of combat veterans with PTSD displayed the same decrements as their brothers. Deficits were significantly related to PTSD severity and hippocampal volume.\nThe current study provides the first evidence that the relevance of the hippocampus in PTSD might be related to pre-existing configural cue processing deficits that predispose individuals to develop unremitting forms of the disorder.",

    "abstract": "The hypothesis that attachment in adults is influenced by genetic factors was investigated. The within-pair differences in attachment representation in same-sex monozygotic and dizygotic twins were compared using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). The results showed a clear tendency toward monozygotic twins (n = 28) being more concordant than dizygotic twins (n = 13), but the within-pair similarity was also high in both zygosity groups. The results suggest, in behavior genetic terms, that heredity and shared environment may contribute to attachment status in adulthood. This differs from studies of attachment in infancy and early childhood, which report attachment to be explained mainly by shared environment, with minimal influence from genetic factors. Furthermore, the results showed that the distribution of the attachment pattern in twins had the same percentage distribution as reported for singletons. Consequently, there was no tendency toward more insecure attachment in twins than in singletons.",

    "abstract": "We carried out two studies to test the hypothesis that genetic and environmental influences explain population group differences in general mental ability just as they do individual differences within a group. We estimated the heritability and environmentality of scores on the diagrammatic puzzles of the Raven's Coloured and/or Standard Progressive Matrices (CPM/SPM) from two independent twin samples and correlated these estimates with group differences on the same items. In Study 1, 199 pairs of 5- to 7-year-old monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins reared together provided estimates of heritability and environmentality for 36 puzzles from the CPM. These estimates correlated with the differences between the twins and 94 Serbian Roma (both rs=0.32; Ns=36; ps<0.05). In Study 2, 152 pairs of adult MZ and DZ twins reared apart provided estimates of heritability and environmentality for 58 puzzles from the SPM. These estimates correlated with the differences among 11 diverse samples including (i) the reared-apart twins, (ii) another sample of Serbian Roma, and (iii) East Asian, White, South Asian, Coloured and Black high school and university students in South Africa. In 55 comparisons, group differences were more pronounced on the more heritable and on the more environmental items (mean rs=0.40 and 0.47, respectively; Ns=58; ps<0.05). After controlling for measurement reliability and variance in item pass rates, the heritabilities still correlated with the group differences, although the environmentalities did not. Puzzles found relatively difficult (or easy) by the twins were those found relatively difficult (or easy) by the others (mean r=0.87). These results suggest that population group differences are part of the normal variation expected within a universal human cognition.",

    "abstract": "Feeding disorders of infancy or early childhood are relatively uncommon in the pediatric population. In posttraumatic eating disorder, the infant demonstrates food refusal after a traumatic event or repeated traumatic events to the oropharynx or esophagus. We present case reports of 24-month-old twin girls, A and B, who presented to our clinic with food refusal and fear of feeding. Several invasive gastrointestinal procedures were performed when they were 3 months old, and they started to refuse all solid food and some liquids soon after hospitalization. Fluoxetine 0.3 mg/kg per day (5 mg/day) was started to target their anxiety and fear about feeding. In the second month of weekly follow up, the children began to be fed without a nasogastric catheter. A significant decrease in anxiety and fear was observed during feeding. Although the use of serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in preschool children is controversial due to the lack of empirical data in this age group, we observed clinical improvements in anxiety in these two cases. Furthermore, fluoxetine was well tolerated and no side effects were observed.",

Final outcome was complete loss of pregnancy.\nSeveral factors have been involved in the etiopathogenesis of monozygotic twins in assisted reproductive technology: maternal age, extended embryo culture and in vitro culture condition, blastocyst-stage transfer, ICSI, and assisted hatching. One of the most important objectives in assisted reproductive technology is to reduce the multiple-gestation rate; therefore, it is necessary to determine the optimum number of embryos to be transferred in each case. In addition, couples must be informed that monozygotic-twin pregnancies could be an important complication in IVF-ICSI cycles.",

    "abstract": "To search DNA methylation difference between monozygotic twins discordant for bipolar disorder, we applied a comprehensive genome scan method, methylation-sensitive representational difference analysis (MS-RDA) to lymphoblastoid cells derived from the twins. MS-RDA isolated 10 DNA fragments derived from 5' region of known genes/ESTs. Among these 10 regions, four regions showed DNA methylation differences between bipolar twin and control co-twin confirmed by bisulfite sequencing. We performed a case-control study of DNA methylation status of these four regions by pyrosequencing. Two regions, upstream regions of spermine synthase (SMS) and peptidylprolyl isomerase E-like (PPIEL) (CN265253), showed aberrant DNA methylation status in bipolar disorder. SMS, a gene on X chromosome, showed significantly higher DNA methylation level in female patients with bipolar disorder compared with control females. However, there was no difference of mRNA expression. In PPIEL, DNA methylation level was significantly lower in patients with bipolar II disorder than in controls. The expression level of PPIEL was significantly higher in bipolar II disorder than in controls. We found strong inverse correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation levels of PPIEL. These results suggest that altered DNA methylation statuses of PPIEL might have some significance in pathophysiology of bipolar disorder..",

Its mode of spread necessitates prompt investigation to identify those with active disease, possible carriers and as many contacts as possible. This article describes a pair of twins with endobronchial tuberculosis following close contact with a family relative who had active disease. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated from the family relative and the two children. Laboratory diagnosis of the mycobacterial strain and epidemiologic follow-up were performed using a molecular biology tool, the restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Treatment was successful due to the close cooperation between the medical staff of the hospitals, the community clinics and the Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Tuberculosis. Treatment was administered by the directly observed therapy (DOT) method recommended by the World Health Organization. This article describes the clinical course and treatment of the patients and reviews the new molecular biology methods currently being used for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and their important clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Associations between anthropometric measures and cancer have been studied previously, but relatively few studies have had the opportunity to control for genetic and early shared environmental factors. In this study, we analyzed 2 twin cohorts from Sweden born 1886-1925 (n = 21,870) and 1926-1958 (n = 30,279) and 1 from Finland born 1880-1958 (n = 25,882) including in total 78,031 twins, and studied the association between BMI and height and risk of prostate, breast, ovarian, corpus uteri, colon and rectal cancer. The cohorts were both analyzed through a co-twin control method and as traditional cohorts. In co-twin control analyses, older obese (BMI > or = 30 kg/m(2)) subjects (median age 56 years at baseline) were at higher risk of cancer of the corpus uteri (OR = 3.0; 95% CI 0.9-10.6), colon (OR = 1.9; 95% CI 0.8-4.5) and breast (OR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.3-4.2). For younger obese women (median age 30 years at baseline), an inverse tendency was observed for breast cancer (OR = 0.6; 95% CI 0.3-1.5, p for trend = 0.05). The tallest women had an increased risk of breast (OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.3-2.7) and ovarian cancer (OR = 1.7; 95% CI 0.8-3.5). No consistent associations were found for prostate cancer either for BMI or height. There are some suggestions in our study that uncontrolled genetic or early shared environmental factors may affect risk estimates in studies of anthropometric measures and cancer risk, but do not explain observations of increased cancer risks related to BMI or height.",

QF-PCR was performed for rapid prenatal diagnosis in uncultured amniocytes and subsequently in cultured cells. Polymorphic markers for chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18 and 21 were used for determination of zygosity as well as sex chromosome aneuploidy.\nTwin A showed a Turner Syndrome (TS) mosaicism pattern by QF-PCR in uncultured amniocytes. The monozygotic origin of the pregnancy was determined. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) in this sample showed a mosaicism X0/XY (83/17%). Cytogenetic analysis revealed a 45,X0 karyotype in twin A and a 46,XY karyotype in twin B.\nQF-PCR is a reliable tool for the determination of the zygosity independently of the chorionicity and the fetal sex in case of twin pregnancy. Testing both direct and cultured cells can provide useful results for genetic counselling in chromosomal mosaicisms.",

    "abstract": "The second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) is sexually dimorphic in humans, such that men on average have a lower 2D:4D than women. This somatic trait has been proposed as a biomarker for the organizational (permanent) effects of prenatal testosterone on the brain and behavior. Over the past few years, an accumulating research program has shown 2D:4D to be related to a multitude of sex-dependent, hormonally influenced psychological and behavioral traits. The present study investigated the 2D:4D ratio of 44 men and 70 women from 36 identical and 21 fraternal twin pairs. Both basic and advanced approaches for estimating heritability concordantly suggested that the trait is substantially heritable. The best-fitting structural equation model indicated that the contributions to individual differences in 2D:4D are 81% additively genetic, 19% nonshared environmental, and 0% shared environmental. Supplemental analyses showed that, consistent with a prediction from sex-hormone transfer theory, women from opposite-sex fraternal twin pairs had significantly lower (more male-typical) 2D:4D than women from same-sex fraternal twin pairs. Directions for research are discussed, such as investigating possible influences of the sex chromosomes on the expression of 2D:4D. Further family studies will be needed to test whether the transmission mode of 2D:4D is consistent with X-linked or Y-linked inheritance. The study of sex chromosome aberrations should indicate whether the presence of additional X or Y chromosomes is associated with 2D:4D levels.",

    "abstract": "To identify genes dysregulated in bipolar disorder (BD1), we carried out global gene expression profiling using whole-genome microarrays. To minimize genetic variation in gene expression levels between cases and controls, we compared expression profiles in lymphoblastoid cell lines from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for the disease. We identified 82 genes that were differentially expressed by >or=1.3-fold in three BD1 cases compared to their co-twins, and which were statistically (P<or=0.05) differentially expressed between the groups of BD1 cases and controls. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we confirmed the differential expression of some of these genes, including: KCNK1, MAL, PFN2, TCF7, PGK1 and PI4KCB, in at least two of the twin pairs. In contrast to the findings of a previous study by Kakiuchi and colleagues with similar discordant BD1 twin design, our data do not support the dysregulation of XBP1 and HSPA5. From pathway and gene ontology analysis, we identified upregulation of the WNT signalling pathway and the biological process of apoptosis. The differentially regulated genes and pathways identified in this study may provide insights into the biology of BD1.",

    "abstract": "To explore the relative impact of genetic and nongenetics factors on human brain anatomy during childhood and adolescence development, a collaborative team from the Child Psychiatry Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health and Virginia Commonwealth University is applying structural equation modeling to brain morphometric data acquired via magnetic resonance imaging from a large sample of monozygotic and dizygotic pediatric subjects. In this report, we discuss methodologic issues related to pediatric neuroimaging twin studies and synthesize results to date from the project. Current sample size from the ongoing longitudinal study is approximately 150 twin pairs. Consistent themes are: (1) heritability is high and shared environmental effects low for most brain morphometric measures; (2) the cerebellum has a distinct heritability profile; (3) genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of the cortex in a regional and age specific manner; and (4) shared genetic effects account for more of the variance than structure specific effects. Understanding of influences on trajectories of brain development may shed light on the emergence of psychopathology during childhood and adolescence and ultimately may guide therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal wall reconstruction in omphalopagus twins poses a difficult reconstructive challenge, as separation often results in a large abdominal wall defect. A number of options are available for closure, including tissue flaps, expanders and patches made of foreign material. Surgisis is a new biodegradable small intestine scaffolding substrate that permits tissue in-growth and results in a permanent durable scar. We describe its use in abdominal wall reconstruction after separation of a set of conjoined twins. A set of omphalopagus conjoined twins shared liver and abdominal wall. After separation at 6 months of age, Twin A's abdomen could be closed primarily, but Twin B could not. A 4-ply Surgisis mesh was used in the upper abdominal closure, and a skin flap was created, to completely cover the patch. Both twins survived the operation. A small portion of the skin flap over the Surgisis broke down, healing by secondary intention. In follow up of over 18 months post procedure, there have been no wound infections and the abdominal wall is intact with no evidence of a hernia. Surgisis can be successfully used for the reconstruction of complex abdominal wall defects in the pediatric patient, including reconstruction after separation of conjoined twins.",

The authors report on a set of identical twins who presented to their service at a relatively young age with myelopathy due to degenerative cervical disc prolapse and who needed surgery. The early age of presentation and the fact that the patients were identical twins suggest a genetic element. The authors also review the available literature on the genetic factors in the causation of degenerative cervical spondylosis. To the best of their knowledge this is the first reported instance of identical twins with cervical myelopathy at a young age needing curative surgery.",

    "abstract": "The onset of type 1A diabetes before the first year of age is a rare condition and is probably due to an interaction between genetic and environmental factors (infection), which, together, may explain such an early event. Studies say that about 15% of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic patients had human Cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific viral genome in their lymphocytes. We report two cases of dizygotic twins with type 1 diabetes onset in their first 9 months of age, with genetic homogeneity (for HLA DR3/DR4 alleles), a history of CMV infection (positive IgG and urinary PCR) and positive antibody anti-GAD (9.6 UI/ml), present only in the second twin. Although they were dizygotic twins, which concordance rate is 3.8%, they assume the equivalent risk as monozygotic (40%) as they have similar high risk genotype (HLA) for type 1 diabetes. We believe that both time concordance and also the early onset of diabetes are due to an association between infection and the high genetic liability.",

    "abstract": "It is shown that the twin index n calculated, according to Friedel, as a function of the indices (hkl) and [uvw] of the lattice plane and lattice direction defining the cell of the twin lattice applies only to twofold twins, i.e. twins where the twin element is of order 2. For manifold twins, where the twin operation is a three-, four- or sixfold (direct or inverse) rotation, it is shown that the generalized formula becomes n=NXi/xi, where N is the number of lattice planes of the (hkl) family passing within the cell of the twin lattice, Xi the two-dimensional coincidence index for a plane of the (hkl) family and xi the number of planes out of N of that family that are partially restored by the twin operation. The existence of twin lattice quasi-symmetry (TLQS) twins with zero-obliquity in manifold twins leads to the introduction of a new parameter as a general measure of the pseudo-symmetry of TLQS rotation twins: the twin misfit delta, defined as the distance between the first nodes along the two shortest directions in the plane of LT (quasi-)perpendicular to the twin axes that are quasi-restored by the twin operation. Taking the example of staurolite twins, several inconsistencies in the treatment of manifold twins are pointed out.",

Concordant twins (i.e. high familial loading group) showed prominent between co-twin differences in lateralization index within given region of interest. Intra-pair differences in lateralization index were significantly higher in concordant twins compared to the controls (0.69+/-0.4 vs. 0.13+/-0.13, P<0.03), albeit no significant differences in the variable were shown between the discordant and control groups.\nThis study provides evidence of reduced cerebral dominance for language processing in patients with schizophrenia. The findings further suggest the need for additional research on relative proportion of genetic and environmental factors underlying deviations of functional asymmetry in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "The changes in i.m. fat deposition in the principal muscles [M. semitendinosus, M. semimembranosus, M. psoas major, M. latissimus dorsi, LM (7th to 8th and 10th to 11th thoracic vertebrae), and M. supraspinatus] from 24 to 30 mo of age were investigated using identical twins of Japanese Black steers. Four sets of identical twins of Japanese Black steers were used in this study. Animals were fattened from 10 to 24 or 30 mo of age for each pair of identical twins. Body weights of twin steers slaughtered at 24 and at 30 mo of age were similar at 10 mo of age and thereafter up to 24 mo of age. The changes in serum concentration of vitamin A, glucose, total cholesterol, albumin, and total protein were similar in each pair of twins during the first fattening stage (10 to 24 mo). Fat contents of LM (7th to 8th thoracic vertebrae) at 24 and 30 mo of age were 37.0 and 42.4%, respectively (P < 0.05). Moreover, in the principal muscles, except M. semimembranosus and M. supraspinatus, fat content at 30 mo of age was greater than at 24 mo of age (P < 0.05). The proportional increase in fat content from 24 to 30 mo of age was greatest in M. semitendinosus (+58.7%) and least in M. supraspinatus (+6.1%). These results demonstrate that i.m. fat continues to increase after 24 mo of age, and the rates of i.m. fat deposition and the ages when i.m. fat is deposited are different for every muscle.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the outcome of screening for structural malformations in twins and the outcome of screening for twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) among monochorionic twins through a number of ultrasound scans from 12 weeks' gestation.\nEnrolled into this prospective multicenter observational study were women with twin pregnancies diagnosed before 14 + 6 gestational weeks. The monochorionic pregnancies were scanned every second week until 23 weeks in order to rule out early TTTS. All pregnancies had an anomaly scan in week 19 and fetal echocardiography in week 21 that was performed by specialists in fetal echocardiography. Zygosity was determined by DNA analysis in all twin pairs with the same sex.\nAmong the 495 pregnancies the prenatal detection rate for severe structural abnormalities including chromosomal aneuploidies was 83% by the combination of a first-trimester nuchal translucency scan and the anomaly scan in week 19. The incidence of severe structural abnormalities was 2.6% and two-thirds of these anomalies were cardiac. There was no significant difference between the incidence in monozygotic and dizygotic twins, nor between twins conceived naturally or those conceived by assisted reproduction. The incidence of TTTS was 23% from 12 weeks until delivery, and all those monochorionic twin pregnancies that miscarried had signs of TTTS.\nTwin pregnancies have an increased risk of congenital malformations and one out of four monochorionic pregnancies develops TTTS. Ultrasound screening to assess chorionicity and follow-up of monochorionic pregnancies to detect signs of TTTS, as well as malformation screening, are therefore essential in the antenatal care of twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "A questionnaire-based identification of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients in a twin cohort.\nThe purpose of this study was to establish a scoliosis twin cohort to provide data on the heritability of AIS.\nThe etiology of AIS is still unclear, and the true mode of inheritance has yet to be established. Concordance rates in monozygotic twins have been reported to be between 0.73 and 0.92, and in dizygotic twins between 0.36 and 0.63. Studies on concordance in twin pairs provide a basis for analyzing the influence of genetic versus environmental factors.\nAll 46,418 twins registered in the Danish Twin Registry born from 1931 to 1982 were sent a questionnaire, which included questions about scoliosis. A total of 34,944 (75.3%) representing 23,204 pairs returned the questionnaire.\nA subgroup of 220 subjects considered to have AIS was identified, thus giving a prevalence of 1.05%. The concordant twin pairs were all monozygotic. Pairwise, the concordance rate was 0.13 for monozygotic and zero for dizygotic twin pairs; proband-wise concordance was 0.25 for monozygotic and zero for dizygotic pairs. The concordance of monozygotic and dizygotic pairs was significantly different (P < 0.05).\nWe have found evidence for a genetic etiology in AIS, but the risk of developing scoliosis in 1 twin whose other twin has scoliosis is smaller than believed up until now.",

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is a key insulin-sensitizing adipokine acting on muscle metabolism via two specific receptors [adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, respectively)].\nThe aim of the study was to investigate the genetic and nongenetic control of plasma adiponectin and muscle AdipoR1/R2 gene expression and the impact of these components on in vivo glucose and fat metabolism.\nPlasma adiponectin and muscle gene expression of AdipoR1/R2 were measured before and during insulin infusion in 89 young and 69 elderly monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Insulin action, and glucose and fat oxidation rates were determined using hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps and indirect calorimetry.\nWe demonstrated a genetic component in the control of plasma adiponectin and AdipoR1/R2 gene expression. Furthermore, levels of adiponectin and AdipoR1/R2 were influenced by age, sex, abdominal obesity, and aerobic capacity. Intrapair correlations in monozygotic twins indicated a nongenetic influence of birth weight on plasma adiponectin and AdipoR2 expression. Nonoxidative glucose metabolism was associated with AdipoR1 and plasma adiponectin, in young and elderly twins, respectively. In addition, plasma adiponectin was related to glucose and fat oxidation in younger subjects.\nPlasma adiponectin and muscle gene expression of its specific receptors are controlled by genetic and several specific nongenetic factors.

Neither patient showed marked microcephaly. Neuroimaging revealed a simplified gyral pattern in the bilateral frontotemporal areas, a reduced volume of cerebral white matter, and a thin corpus callosum in both patients. The cerebral cortex presented with significant thickness in the anterior temporal region at the age of 10 years, which suggest that the simplified gyri can evolve into the pachygyria during postnatal period. These cases may represent a hereditary brain malformation with a distinct pattern of abnormal cortical gyration. The age-dependent change in appearance of dysgenetic cortex should be further explored in cases with brain malformations.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies suggest that variation in human brain volume is genetically influenced. The genes involved in human brain volume variation are still largely unknown, but several candidate genes have been suggested. An overview of structural Magnetic Resonance (brain) Imaging studies in twins is presented, which focuses on the influence of genetic factors on variation in healthy human brain volume. Twin studies have shown that genetic effects varied regionally within the brain, with high heritabilities of frontal lobe volumes (90-95%), moderate estimates in the hippocampus (40-69%), and environmental factors influencing several medial brain areas. High heritability estimates of brain structures were revealed for regional amounts of gray matter (density) in medial frontal cortex, Heschl's gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. In addition, moderate to high heritabilities for densities of Broca's area, anterior cingulate, hippocampus, amygdala, gray matter of the parahippocampal gyrus, and white matter of the superior occipitofrontal fasciculus were reported. The high heritability for (global) brain volumes, including the intracranium, total brain, cerebral gray, and white matter, seems to be present throughout life. Estimates of genetic and environmental influences on age-related changes in brain structure in children and adults await further longitudinal twin-studies. For prefrontal cortex volume, white matter, and hippocampus volumes, a number of candidate genes have been identified, whereas for other brain areas, only a few or even a single candidate gene has been found so far. New techniques such as genome-wide scans may become helpful in the search for genes that are involved in the regulation of human brain volume throughout life.",

    "abstract": "Abnormalities of the thalamus are thought to be central to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. These abnormalities include altered structure and shape of the thalamus itself and possibly changes to the adhesio interthalamica (or massa intermedia), the gray matter bridge connecting the 2 thalamic lobes. However, it is not clear to what extent these abnormalities are determined by the genetic liability for schizophrenia.\nTo investigate thalamic volume and the presence of the adhesio interthalamica in monozygotic (MZ) twins concordant or discordant for schizophrenia.\nStudy of MZ twins.\nPatients were drawn from inpatient and outpatient clinics. Twin controls were recruited from a volunteer twin register and through media advertisements.\nA total of 123 twins participated: 19 MZ twin pairs concordant for schizophrenia, 15 MZ schizophrenic twins and 16 MZ nonschizophrenic twins drawn from 17 pairs discordant for schizophrenia, and 27 MZ twin pairs without schizophrenia. Groups were matched for age, sex, handedness, level of education, parental socioeconomic status, and ethnicity.\nThe volume of the thalamus (including right and left hemispheres) was measured (in cubic centimeters) and the presence of the adhesio interthalamica was ascertained from structural magnetic resonance images.\nConcordant twin pairs displayed significantly reduced thalamic volume compared with control twins, even when covarying for effects of whole-brain volume, age, and sex. There was a significant linear decrease in thalamic volume (control greater than discordant nonschizophrenic greater than discordant schizophrenic greater than concordant). In all groups, right thalamus was larger than left thalamus. There was no difference across groups in the frequency of the adhesio interthalamica.\nVolumetric thalamic abnormalities in schizophrenia occur in twin pairs concordant for schizophrenia. These abnormalities may mark the substantial genetic contribution to the illness seen in concordant twin pairs, whereas the adhesio interthalamica is unlikely to be affected in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether lower body negative pressure (LBNP) treadmill exercise maintains lumbar spinal compressive properties, curvature, and back muscle strength after 28 days of 6 degrees head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest (BR). We hypothesize that LBNP treadmill exercise will maintain lumbar spine compressibility, lumbar lordosis and back muscle strength after 28 days of 6 degrees HDT bed rest. Fifteen healthy identical twin pairs (14 women and 16 men) participated in this study. One identical twin was randomly assigned to the nonexercise control (Con) group, and their sibling was assigned to the exercise (Ex) group. The lumbar spine was significantly more compressible Post-BR compared with Pre-BR in the Con (P=0.01). Lumbar spine compressibility Post-BR was not significantly different compared with Pre-BR in the Ex group (P=0.89). In both the Con and Ex groups, there were no significant changes Post-BR in lumbar lordosis compared with Pre-BR. Back muscle strength significantly decreased in the Con group Post-BR (P=0.002), whereas in the Ex group back muscle strength was not significantly different from Pre-BR values. A significant increase in lumbar spine compressibility in the Con group suggests that spinal deconditioning to gravity occurs during 28-day bed rest. Changes in the mechanical properties of the lumbar spine may be an early indicator of lumbar intervertebral disk degeneration. Supine LBNP treadmill exercise provides axial loads to the lumbar spine and may prevent lumbar spine deconditioning associated with HDT bed rest.",

    "abstract": "Despite greater negative environmental influences such as lower socioeconomic status, less parental education, more single-parent households and urban dwelling, African Americans are less likely to begin smoking than European Americans. The goal of the current investigation was to examine the proportion of genetic and environmental influences on smoking in a sample of adult African-American twins.\nBirth records from North Carolina Register of Deeds Offices were used to identify participants for the Carolina African-American Twin Study of Aging (CAATSA). Participants completed an in-person interview that included measures of health status, cognition and psychosocial measures.\nData for the analysis come from 200 pairs of same-sex twins (97 identical pairs and 113 fraternal), with a mean age = 46.9 years (SD = 13.9) and 38% of the sample being men.\nCompared to previous research on smoking, our estimates are very similar with genetics, accounting for about 60% of the individual variance in current smoking. We did find that there was a significant amount of genetic variance in pack years but no shared environmental influences.\nSimilarity in proportions of genetic influences lead to larger questions about the genes involved in smoking among African Americans working in the same manner as in Caucasians or other groups. Additionally, this same question holds for the environmental variance. It is perhaps most likely that while the proportions of environmental variance are similar between groups that the actual source of variance (e.g., poverty, urban rural context, socioeconomic status, attitudes of family and friends) may differ when comparing ethnic groups.",

    "abstract": "This study explored the genetic and prenatal environmental influences on the development of reaching in twins. Detailed kinematic measures of arm movements and underlying muscle co-activation from two sets of monozygotic twins (MZ; one set was monochorionic; the other was dichorionic) and one set of dizygotic (DZ) were measured weekly from reach onset to 30 weeks, then bi-weekly to 1 year of age. Improvements in trajectories were not linear, but the MZ twins demonstrated higher correlations between kinematic variables compared to DZ twins and unrelated infants. Although all infants showed increase in muscle co-activation across the year, MZ twins showed no more correlations in muscle states than DZ twins or unrelated infants. The results suggest that reaches are not planned at the level of the muscles, and that anatomical, biomechanical, and energetic factors act as strong constraints on the inherent kinematic and muscle variability.",

    "abstract": "All solid bodies emit electromagnetic radiation at temperatures above absolute zero. The radiation spectrum depends, among other factors, on temperature. Thermovision is a method in which an infrared camera is used to record infrared radiation (IR) emitted by human skin. It is widely used in medicine, for instance to diagnose inflammation of the skin, some types of neoplasms, collagenosis, and peripheral vascular disease. The literature, however, lacks reports on the variability in thermal emission by the skin of healthy individuals or twins. Interpretation of the results is based on simply analysing the subject individually or comparing symmetrical body sides. Hence, there is a need to study thermal emission using monozygotic twins as a model.\nAn attempt was made in the present study to determine the variability of thermal phenotypes of faces, backs, and hands in monozygotic twins (MZ), compare thermal emission in MZ and dizygotic twins (DZ), and establish the thermal norm. Using the ThermaCAM SC500 camera, 44 pairs of MZ and 15 pairs of DZ were studied. Descriptive statistics are given as means, standard deviation, and max. and min. values. The following tests were used for statistical analysis: Shapiro-Wilk's, Snedecor's, Brown-Forsythe's, Mann-Whitney's U, and Kruskal-Wallis. Data from the digital image analyser were tested using the cluster analysis methods, especially the k-means method.\nThe following conclusions were drawn: 1. Full genetic identity does not produce a thermal consistency within the range of isotherms tested, whether in relation to their values or distribution. 2. Differences in the thermal image may have their source in ontogenetic development during intra-uterine and postnatal stages and may be related to individual differences in adaptation to the environment. 3. These results are potentially useful to compare physiological states between individuals and to differentiate pathological changes. 4. The results of this study do not allow for any conclusions regarding the thermal norm. However, a basis has been created for further research in larger samples of the population.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to the development of relative weight during the growth period.\nLongitudinal twin study.\nTwo-hundred and thirty-one monozygotic and 144 dizygotic complete male twin pairs born between 1973 and 1979 were measured annually from birth to 18 years of age.\nBody mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) at age 18 correlated with BMI at age 1 (r=0.32, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.21-0.42), and this correlation increased steadily up to age 17 (r=0.91, 95% CI 0.89-0.93). Major part (81-95%) of these trait correlations was attributable to correlate additive genetic factors, but also unique environmental correlations were present during the whole-growth period. The correlation between ponderal index (kg/m(3)) at birth and BMI at age 18 was small (r=0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.15) and totally because of correlated unique environmental factors.\nOur results suggest persistent genetic regulation of BMI from age 1 to 18. However, environmental factors, not shared by siblings, also affected the correlations of BMI. A small specific environmental correlation was found between ponderal index at birth and BMI at age 18, which may reflect the effect of neonatal environmental factors on adult BMI. A challenge to the future research is to identify chromosome regions and specific genes regulating the development of BMI as well as environmental factors affecting BMI through the growth period independently or interacting with genetic factors.",

Individual differences in imitative ability were due to modest heritability (30%), while environmental factors shared between twins (42%) and unique to each twin (28%) also made significant contributions to the variance. Imitation correlated significantly, although modestly, with vocabulary, pretend play, and socially insightful behavior, and the strongest relationship was with vocabulary. A model that represented the covariance between the variables as being due to correlated latent genetic and environmental factors fitted the data well, with shared environmental factors influencing most of the covariance.

    "abstract": "Previous research has reported that greater intelligence in early life is associated with longer lifespan. Whether this relationship is mediated by genetic factors or environmental factors, some of which could be modified by an individual, is unclear.\nWe examined the association between intelligence test scores, obtained during the 1940s, and age at death in a group of 492 male twin pairs, members of the National Academy of Sciences--National Research Council Twins Registry of WWII veterans.\nUsing self-report information collected in th 1960s, we examined whether modifiable risk factors for mortality, such as use of tobacco and alcohol, cardiovascular disease, and body mass index altered the association between intelligence and longevity.\nWhen each member of a twin pair was treated as an independent observation, higher intelligence test scores were associated with longer life span (P = 0.0002). Modifiable risk factors were associated with life span as expected. However, in co-twin control analyses in which one twin served as the control for the other twin, neither intelligence nor any modifiable risk factors showed a significant association with life span.\nOur findings suggest that genetics and early life environmental factors contribute heavily to lifespan and when one controls for these factors using twins, the effect of intelligence on longevity is diminished.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) experience many pain symptoms.

Subjective ratings of pain and fatigue at multiple time points during the experimental protocol among twins with CFS were significantly higher than ratings of pain (P = 0.003) and fatigue (P < 0.001) by their cotwins without CFS.\nThese results, while preliminary, highlight the perceptual and cognitive components to the pain experience in CFS. Future studies should focus on examining the heritability of pain sensitivity and the underlying mechanisms involved in the perception of pain sensitivity in CFS.",

In 1915 they joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC), serving to the end of World War I (WWI), each being awarded the Military Cross for gallantry. After WWI, they trained as radiologists and moved to St Leonards-on-Sea in West Sussex, taking up Consultant posts at the Royal East Sussex Hospital and the Municipal Hospital in Hastings, and the Eversfield Chest Hospital in St Leonards. In 1940 they rejoined the RAMC as radiologists, serving throughout World War II.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the deep roots of closeness that twins share in their youngest age and their effect on their destiny at the adult age. Psychologists believe the bond between twins begins in utero and develops throughout the twins' lives. The four patterns of twinship described show that the twin bond is determined by the quality of parenting that twins receive in their infancy and early childhood. Common problems of adult twins bring about difficulties to adapt in a non-twin world. The nature versus nurture controversy has taken on new life focusing on inter-twin differences and the importance of parent-child interaction as fundamental to the growth and development of personality.",

Hair growth was evaluated using standardized clinical photographs, hair counts, and patient self-assessment questionnaires.\nDutasteride significantly improved hair growth at 1-year compared to placebo based on the analysis of the investigator assessment and the patient self-assessment questionnaires. Sixteen of 17 sets of twins completed the study, of which 15 sets correctly predicted the use of dutasteride. Only one set could not determine the active drug from the placebo.\nThrough the use of identical twins, this randomized trial provides evidence that dutasteride significantly reduces hair loss progression in men with male pattern hair loss.",

    "abstract": "Several structural brain abnormalities have been reported in patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, the etiology of these brain changes is still unclear. To investigate genetic and environmental influences on ADHD related neurobiological changes, we performed Voxel-Based Morphometry on MRI scans from monozygotic (MZ) twins selected from a large longitudinal population database to be highly concordant or highly discordant for ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist Attention Problem scale (CBCL-AP). Children scoring low on the CBCL-AP are at low risk for ADHD, whereas children scoring high on this scale are at high-risk for ADHD. Brain differences between concordant high-risk twin pairs and concordant low-risk twin pairs likely reflect the genetic risk for ADHD; brain differences between the low-risk and high-risk twins from discordant MZ twin pairs reflect the environmental risk for ADHD. A major difference between comparisons of high and low-risk twins from concordant pairs and high/low twins from discordant pairs was found for the prefrontal lobes. The concordant high-risk pairs showed volume loss in orbitofrontal subdivisions. High-risk members from the discordant twin pairs exhibited volume reduction in the right inferior dorsolateral prefontal cortex. In addition, the posterior corpus callosum was compromised in concordant high-risk pairs, only. Our findings indicate that inattention and hyperactivity symptoms are associated with anatomical abnormalities of a distributed action-attentional network. Different brain areas of this network appear to be affected in inattention/hyperactivity caused by genetic (i.e., high concordant MZ pairs) vs. environmental (i.e., high-low discordant MZ pairs) risk factors. These results provide clues that further our understanding of brain alterations in ADHD.",

Prenatal fetal sonography showed a bichorial biamniotic pregnancy with increased nuchal translucency in twin A and a cervical cystic hygroma and heart defect in twin B. Cytogenetic analysis performed after double amniocentesis showed free and homogeneous trisomy 21 in both twins. Monozygosity was confirmed by molecular analysis. The pregnancy was terminated at 17 weeks of gestation (WG). Postmortem analysis confirmed the phenotypic discordance. To our knowledge, this is the first reported prenatal diagnosis of MZ male twins with different Down syndrome phenotypes but identical karyotypes. We discuss the mechanisms involved in phenotypic discordance of monozygotic twins and particularly the role of environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "We describe a case of dizygotic twin pregnancy which was referred to our centre because of a discordant anomaly of one of the twins. The ultrasound examination revealed a large extra-abdominal mass (liver and bowel) with micromelia, severe kyphoscoliosis and a short umbilical cord of the second dizygotic discordant twin. These ultrasound findings were diagnosed as body stalk anomaly. Body stalk anomaly in twins is extremely rare. This is, to our knowledge, one of the few documented cases reported on dizygotic twins discordant for this anomaly. This finding, in association with a decrease of amniotic fluid volume, may be attributed to early amniotic membrane rupture as the primary event in the pathogenesis of body stalk anomaly.",

    "abstract": "To assess the genetic and environmental influences on the somatotype of children and adolescents, and the effects of sex and age.\nThe components of somatotype were calculated by using Heather-Cater method in a total of 376 twin pairs of Han nationality, including 245 monozygotic (MZ) and 131 like-sex dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs aged 6 to 18 years. Model-fitting method by Mx package was performed to evaluate the proportion of variance components and to analyze the effects of sex and age on each component of somatotype using the adjusted data for other two somatotype components. The heritability of each component in different development periods divided by growth spurt was also evaluated.\nThe estimated heritabilities of endomorphic, mesomorphic and ectomorphic components were 0.45, 0.80, 0.44 in boys, 0.82, 0.79 and 0.81 in girls respectively after adjusting age. In boys, the heritability of endomorphic component during late puberty was significantly higher than that during pre-puberty (t = 4.99, P < 0.01) and puberty (t = 6.16, P < 0.01), while the heritability of ectomorphic component during late puberty was significantly lower than that during pre-puberty (t = 3.35, P < 0.01) and puberty (t = 4.12, P < 0.01). In girls, the heritability of endomorphic (t = 2.77, P < 0.01) or mesomorphic (t = 2.08, P < 0.05) component during pre-puberty was significantly higher than that in early puberty.\nThe genetic influence on somatotype of girls should be much more than that of boys, especially on the endomorphic and ectomorphic components. For boys, the mesomorphic component is mainly determined by genetic factors, but the other components are mainly affected by environmental ones. The effects of the development periods on the heritability of somatotype should be paid much attention to.",

    "abstract": "A cross-sectional twin design was used to study the developmental nature of genetic and environmental influences on morningness-eveningness (M-E). A total of 977 South Korean twin pairs aged 9-23 years completed 13 items of a Korean version of the Composite Scale through the telephone interview. The total sample was split into three age groups: preadolescents, adolescents, and young adults. Twin correlations did not vary significantly with age, suggesting that genetic influences on M-E are stable throughout the developmental span. Results of model-fitting analyses indicated that genetic and environmental factors explained, respectively, 45% and 55% of the variance in all three age groups. Environmental factors were primarily those factors that twins did not share as a consequence of their common rearing; family environmental factors in M-E were consistently near zero in all three age groups. The present study is the first to demonstrate genetic influences on M-E in preadolescent children as young as 9 years old. In spite of differences in culture and frequencies of genes between South Koreans and Caucasians, genetic and environmental influences on M-E found in the present sample were remarkably similar to those reported by previous studies on the basis of late adolescent and adult Caucasian twins.",

Velamentous cord insertions were recorded and individual placental territories were calculated by computer analysis.\nA total of 76 monochorionic placentas with TTTS and 63 monochorionic placentas without TTTS were studied. The incidence of velamentous cord insertion (per fetus) in the TTTS group and the non-TTTS group was 13% (20 of 152) and 14% (18 of 126), respectively (P = .79). Placental territory discordancy in the TTTS group and the non-TTTS group was 20% and 20% (P = 0.83). In the TTTS group, donor twins had a velamentous cord insertion more often than recipient twins (24% and 3%, respectively, P < .001) and a smaller placental territory (44% and 56%, respectively, P < .001).\nOur findings suggest that velamentous cord insertion and unequal placental territory are not critical factors for the development of TTTS.",

    "abstract": "We report on two 33 years old monozygotic twins with chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc) misdiagnosed as schizophrenia and Tourette syndrome, respectively. Although the patients shared several clinical similarities, there were also some clear differences: twin 1 presented initially with an acute episode of a paranoid schizophrenia, while twin 2 suffered from generalized epileptic seizures. In both twins, MRI demonstrated caudate nucleus atrophy and an increased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the striatum bilaterally with right sided predominance. (18)F-FDG PET showed bilaterally reduced glucose utilization in the striatum with clearly pronounced reduction on the right side compared to the left and in twin 1 compared to twin 2. Ratios of binding to striatal dopamine transporters (DAT) and serotonin transporters in the hypothalamus midbrain area as determined using (123)I-beta-CIT-SPECT fell within the normal ranges. However, in twin 1 a significant difference in binding to presynaptic DAT with marked reduction on the right hemisphere was observed. Right hemispheric accentuated changes measured by MRI, FDG-PET, and (123)I-beta-CITSPECT correspond to more severe hyperkinetic movements on the left part of the body in both twins. Different neuro-psychiatric features in this monocygotic twin pair suggest that not only genetic but also environmental factors contribute to the clinical symptomatology. Our findings suggest that the main neuropathological process in ChAc is located in the striatum, involving microstructural alterations, and disturbance of metabolism and dopaminergic neurotransmission.",

    "abstract": "To present the risk factors, prenatal and postnatal implications of monochorionic dyzygotic twinning.\nWe present a case of monochorionic twins diagnosed on first-trimester ultrasound following a 2-embryo transfer in vitro fertilisation pregnancy. Postnatal buccal smears performed as part of a twin research study revealed the twins to be dizygous, and DNA testing on peripheral blood lymphocytes confirmed the presence of blood chimerism.\nDespite the monochorionic placentation, buccal swabs revealed discordant results for all four microsatellite loci tested, consistent with dizygosity. Zygosity testing on peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed that, of the nine DNA microsatellite loci tested, three had all four parental alleles represented. This result was concordant between the twins. The diagnosis of blood chimerism was thus confirmed, presumably due to the inter-twin vascular anastomoses of the monochorionic placenta.\nMonochorionic dizygous twinning is rare, but appears to be more common after assisted reproduction. It is presumed that outer cell mass fusion may occur when two embryos are replaced in close proximity. These pregnancies are not only at risk for the usual complications of monochorionicity, but also have the potential to be heterokaryotypic. Postnatally, the twins may have long-term blood chimerism.",

    "abstract": "In this survey, we review published investigations and trials of vaccines among twins. We identified 29 original studies, dating back to 1979. The studies include determinations of the role of genetics and environment in the variation in immune response to vaccination, the investigation of adverse events in which vaccination was the suspected etiologic agent, and the occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases or their complications. Specific methods include case reports, cross-sectional surveys, prospective surveys, and double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over studies. We examine three of these studies in detail to illustrate important opportunities and limitations of twins studies in vaccinology.",

    "abstract": "The influence of genetics on human physique and obesity has been addressed by the literature. Evidence for heritability of anthropometric characteristics has been previously described, mainly for the body mass index (BMI). However, few studies have investigated the influence of genetics on the Heath-Carter somatotype. The aim of the present study was to assess the heritability of BMI and somatotype (endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy) in a group of female monozygotic and dizygotic twins from childhood to early adulthood. A total of 28 females aged from 7 to 19 years old were studied. The group included 5 monozygotic and 9 dizygotic pairs of twins. The heritability was assessed by the twin method (h(2)). The anthropometric measures and somatotype were assessed using standard validated procedures. Significant differences between monozygotic and dizygotic pairs of twins were found for height, endomorphy, ectomorphy, and mesomorphy, and the heritability for these measures was high (h(2) between 0.88 and 0.97). No significant differences were found between monozygotic and dizygotic twins for weight, and the BMI and the heritability indexes were lower for these measures (respectively 0.42 and 0.52). The results of the present study have indicated that the somatotype may be more sensible to genetic influences than the BMI in females.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the oral health in monozygotic twins where one twin had coronary heart disease (CHD) and the other twin had no clinical signs of the disease.\nTen monozygotic twin pairs (age 55-81 years, eight male, and two female pairs) were recruited from the Swedish twin register. The inclusion criterion for participation was discordance regarding the presence of CHD within every twin pair. All participants underwent a full dental clinical examination including a panoramic radiograph.\nTwins with CHD had 51.5% bleeding on probing compared with 21.1% without CHD (p=0.01), and more pathological pockets (> or = 4 mm) were detected among those with CHD (20+/-15 versus 8+/-5), p=0.047). Twins with CHD had a reduced horizontal bone level in comparison with the healthy group (73%versus 78%, p=0.03). Logistic analyses using odds ratio (OR) showed that an increase of one periodontal pocket (> or = 4 mm) resulted in an increased risk for the actual twin of belonging to the CHD group (OR 1.17, p=0.03).\nThis study indicates worsened periodontal conditions among twins with CHD compared with their siblings with no history of CHD. This strengthens the association between periodontal inflammation and the presence of atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "The primary purpose was to characterize mean and individual-level patterns of change in physical functional performance over eight years (2 year intervals) in a community dwelling sample of Swedish twins (579 men and women aged 79-96 years at baseline).\nMixed linear models revealed linear rates of decline for handgrip strength (grip) and time to complete five chair stands, and accelerating decline for peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) for both sexes. Significant random effects were found for intercept and time for grip and PEFR tests, indicating differences between participants initially and over time. Individual differences in chair-stand performance were significant for initial status only. Age at baseline was predictive of initial status in grip, PEFR and chair performance (women only), but not rate of change. Measures of body size at baseline were predictive of individual variation in initial grip (height), PEFR (weight in men, height in women), and chair performance (height), but had less consistent associations with changes in test performance over time. In the deceased sub-sample (85% of participants), having been further from death was related to less steep declines in grip, but not PEFR or chair performance. Twins from the same pair were related in initial status (twin level variance ~30-70%), but they were not generally related in rate of change.\nThese results indicate that changes in physical functional performance in an elderly, community-dwelling population vary across individuals in a testand sex-dependent manner. Constitutional variables (age, sex, body size) are predictive of baseline performance, but explain little variance in change over time. Initial status and rate of change in grip strength had the strongest association with proximity from death, indicating that while PEFR and repeated chair stand time are useful tests to assess function, grip strength appears to be a particularly useful biomarker in the oldest-old.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the association between placental location in diamniotic-dichorionic twins as determined at the time of anatomic survey and birth weight.\nWe retrospectively identified all diamniotic-dichorionic twins in our Maternal-Fetal Medicine sonography database between 2000 and 2005 who had an anatomic survey, went on to be delivered at our hospital, and had records available for review (n = 304). Placental location for each twin was determined at the time of anatomic survey and grouped into both anterior or both posterior versus separate anterior and posterior. Maternal and fetal characteristics were collected from chart review. Placental pathologic findings were available for 249 (83%) patients. Outcomes analyzed were percent discordance, small size for gestational age of twin A or B, and difference in birth weight as a continuous variable. Multivariable logistic regression using stepwise backward elimination was used to adjust for potential confounders.\nThere was no difference in discordance of 20% or greater or incidence of small size for gestational age when both placentas were both anterior and both posterior compared with separate anterior and posterior: adjusted odds ratio (AdjOR), 1.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-2.95); and AdjOR, 1.29 (95% CI, 0.57-2.89). The actual birth weight difference (A - B) was not affected by placental location (P = .36). Opposite sex fetuses and nulliparity were significantly associated with birth weight discordance: AdjOR, 2.68 (95% CI, 1.39-5.17); and AdjOR, 0.34 (95% CI, 0.28-0.94).\nWe did not find a correlation between birth weight and placental location in our cohort analysis. The presence of sex-discordant twins was associated with birth weight discordance of 20% or greater, whereas nulliparity was protective.",

    "abstract": "The Duke Twins Study of Memory in Aging is an ongoing, longitudinal study of cognitive change and dementia in the population-based National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC) Twin Registry of World War II Male Veterans. The primary goal of this study has been to estimate the overall genetic and environmental contributions to dementia with a specific focus on Alzheimer's disease. An additional goal has been to examine specific genetic and environmental antecedents of cognitive decline and dementia. Since 1989, we have completed 4 waves of data collection. Each wave included a 2-phase telephone cognitive screening protocol, followed by an in-home standardized clinical assessment for those with suspected dementia. For many participants, we have obtained postmortem neuropathological confirmation of the diagnosis of dementia. In addition to data on cognition, we have also collected information on occupational history, medical history, medications and other lifetime experiences that may influence cognitive function in late life. We provide an overview of the study's methodology and describe the focus of recent research.",

We outline our experience to date, providing estimates of crude response rates for a variety of different study designs and protocols. We have experienced very high response rates in our studies to date, even in studies with demanding protocols. Lowest response rates have occurred in studies among afflicted individuals, and in one with an unusual protocol. We have experienced some difficulty in locating original members of the cohort, despite efforts to trace individuals using a variety of sources of information. However, in most analyses, the participating sample of twins does not differ substantially from the underlying sample from the CTP. Future work will focus on improving methods of re-contacting cohort members.",

    "abstract": "The Swedish Young Male Twins Study is a population-based longitudinal twin study founded in 1997 through record-linkages of several national registers. Details on pregnancy and birth were obtained from the Swedish Medical Birth Register and used to identify 3566 male twins (1783 pairs) born in Sweden between 1973 and 1979 and resident in Sweden in 1997. A record-linkage was made between the Medical Birth Register and the Military Service Conscription Register for the years 1991 to 1999, providing information on body weight, height, blood pressure, muscle strength, cognitive ability of these twins at age 18 and 19 years. In 1998, 2002 and 2005 to 2006, the twins were surveyed on their zygosity, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors (such as eating habits, physical activity, smoking habits, use of alcohol etc), height and weight. In 2002, additional information was collected on perceived body shape and size, and eating behavior, according to the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire. In 2003, DNA via buccal mucosa was collected from a subset of the twins. Recent research using the Swedish Young Male Twins datasets has explored the relationships between fetal growth, body size and blood pressure in young adulthood, genetic and environmental contributions to eating behavior and physical activity, and relationships between diet and physical activity patterns with longitudinal changes in body mass index and attained waist circumference.",

    "abstract": "In the late 1980s The Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) was established by recruiting young twins and multiples at birth and by approaching adolescent and young adult twins through city councils. The Adult NTR (ANTR) includes twins, their parents, siblings, spouses and their adult offspring. The number of participants in the ANTR who take part in survey and / or laboratory studies is over 22,000 subjects. A special group of participants consists of sisters who are mothers of twins. In the Young NTR (YNTR), data on more than 50,000 young twins have been collected. Currently we are extending the YNTR by including siblings of twins. Participants in YNTR and ANTR have been phenotyped every 2 to 3 years in longitudinal survey studies, since 1986 and 1991 for the YNTR and ANTR, respectively. The resulting large population-based datasets are used for genetic epidemiological studies and also, for example, to advance phenotyping through the development of new syndrome scales based on existing items from other inventories. New research developments further include brain imaging studies in selected and unselected groups, clinical assessment of psychopathology through interviews, and cross-referencing the NTR database to other national databases. A large biobank enterprise is ongoing in the ANTR in which blood and urine samples are collected for genotyping, expression analysis, and metabolomics studies. In this paper we give an update on the YNTR and ANTR phenotyping and on the ongoing ANTR biobank studies.",

A population-based twin registry was constructed by the KTP through the use of official residential records in the Tokyo area, and to date requests to participate in our research have generated 1040 pairs of twins and triplets of age 14 to 30, forming one of the largest twin registries in Asia. Our comprehensive datasets, obtained through questionnaires, performance tests, and physical measurements, cover a wide range of human traits: personality, psychiatry, mental health, sociality, cognition, and physical index. Demographic variables and environment of upbringing are also sought by twins and by some parents. This extensive information allows us to clarify the genetic and environmental overlap across multiple traits as well as specificities unique to single traits. Adding an evolutionary psychology perspective to the behavior genetics framework is currently being attempted in order to develop a grand theory of human genetics.",

    "abstract": "More than 100 pairs of adult twins, reared apart and growing old separately, have participated in the Japanese Study of Adult Twins Reared Apart and Growing Old Separately since it began in 1974. The subjects are 161 pairs of adult twins born between 1910 and 1945 in Japan. The main focus of this study is to investigate the influences of environmental factors and life history on life satisfaction and psychological well-being in later adulthood. A mail survey has been conducted on these twins each year since 1974. To date, the Wechsler Adult Intelligent Scale, Maudsley Personality Inventory, Newgarten Life Satisfaction Index, comprehensive medical examinations and personal interviews have been conducted for 12 twin pairs residing in various areas of Japan.",

    "abstract": "Our studies of the teeth and faces of Australian twins commenced at the School of Dentistry, The University of Adelaide in the early 1980s. There are now over 900 pairs of twins enrolled in our continuing investigations, together with 1200 relatives. There are 3 main cohorts of participants. The first cohort comprises around 300 pairs of teenage twins for whom various records have been collected, including dental casts, facial photographs, finger and palm prints and information on laterality, including handedness. The second cohort comprises around 300 pairs of twins who have been examined at 3 stages of dental development from approximately 4 years of age to about 14 years: at primary, mixed, and permanent dentition (excluding 3rd molars) stages. The most recent study of tooth emergence and oral health, for which we are currently recruiting twins, will provide a third cohort of around 500 twin pairs aged from around birth to 3 to 4 years of age. Our broad aim in these studies has been to improve our understanding of how genetic and environmental factors contribute to variation in dental and facial features, and to oral health. We have also used our data to investigate aspects of the determination of laterality, particularly the fascinating phenomenon of mirror imaging. We plan to maximize the use of the longitudinal data and DNA we have collected, and continue to collect, by performing genome-wide scans for putative genetic linkage peaks for a range of dental features, and then to test for association between a series of likely candidate genes and our phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The association between socioeconomic circumstances and health in adulthood could come about through processes that may be divided into factors experienced early in life and those experienced in later adulthood. In order to disentangle the influences on health of the early genetic, prenatal and rearing environmental factors from environmental factor later in life, we compared the health status among male and female twin pairs who lived together during childhood and were discordant or concordant on adult socioeconomic position.\nA cross-sectional survey among a random sample of middle-aged Danish twins was conducted in 1998-99. The study population included 1266 like-sex twin pairs [52.5% monozygotic (MZ) and 47.6% dizygotic (DZ)]. Data were obtained on childhood and adult social class and on height, BMI, grip strength, depression symptoms, self-rated health, cognitive function, physical activity, smoking, alcohol and food intake.\nThe expected associations between the individual twins' adult social class and health measures were observed. Among DZ male twins discordant on adult social class, the higher social class twin was on average significantly taller and had higher cognitive test scores. Among DZ female twins discordant on adult social class, the higher social class female twin was more physically active and had a higher cognitive test score. There were no significant health disparities or behavioural differences between the members of MZ twin pairs discordant on adult social class. For most health outcomes, the variability within twin pairs was related to zygosity (higher for DZ than for MZ) but not to social class.\nThis study suggests that the relationship between adult social class and health outcomes in Denmark is due mainly to selection effects rather than a causal effect of social class exposures on health and behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Lifestyle and genetic factors dominate the etiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease. We investigated associations between lifestyle factors and gastroesophageal reflux (GER) symptoms, with and without controlling for genetic predisposition.\nIn 1967 and 1973, questionnaires including lifestyle exposures were mailed to twins in the Swedish Twin Registry, and data on GER symptoms were collected by telephone interview during 1998-2002. Two analytic methods were used: external control analysis (4083 twins with GER symptoms and 21,383 controls) and monozygotic co-twin control analysis (869 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for GER symptoms).\nIn the external control analysis, leanness (body mass index [BMI] <20), upper normal weight (BMI 22.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), and obese (BMI > or =30) conferred -19%, 25%, 46%, and 59% increased risk of frequent GER symptoms compared with normal weight (BMI 20-22.4), respectively, among women, whereas no such associations were evident among men. When adjusted for genetic and nongenetic familial factors, these estimates were -28%, 44%, 187%, and 277%, respectively, among men. Frequent smoking rendered a 37% increased risk of frequent GER symptoms among women and 53% among men compared with nonsmokers. Physical activity at work was dose dependently associated with increased risk of frequent GER symptoms, and recreational physical activity decreased this risk.\nBMI, tobacco smoking, and physical activity at work appear to be risk factors for frequent GER symptoms, whereas recreational physical activity appears to be beneficial. Association between BMI and frequent GER symptoms among men seems to be attenuated by genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Documentation of superfoetation is extremely rare in humans., The younger foetus has invariably been small for gestational age (estimated from the date of the last menstrual bleed) in all the cases reported in the literature. We report a case where the younger twin was of appropriate size for gestation.\nThe first of twins was of 32 weeks gestation and the baby was of appropriate size and development for the gestational age. The second twin was of 36 weeks gestation. Gestational age was estimated with the New Ballard score, x-ray of the lower limbs, dental age on x-ray, and ophthalmic examination.\nBleeding on implantation of the first foetus probably helped demarcate the two pregnancies. Dental age and the New Ballard score can be used to diagnose superfoetation in discordant twins, when detailed first trimester ultra-sound data is not available.",

    "abstract": "We carried out two distinct types of genetic analysis with data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The first was a non-DNA twin analysis using monozygotic (identical) and same-sex dizygotic (fraternal) twins. The second analysis investigates the association between age at first sexual intercourse and the 48-bp repeat polymorphism in the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4). The twin analysis shows that MZ twins correlate their timing of first sex to a much greater extent than do the same-sex DZ twins. Our analysis of the polymorphisms in DRD4 indicates that those with an any-3R genotype experienced a risk of first sexual intercourse 23% (p = .016), 233% (p = .0001), 28% (p = .012), and 69% (p = .006) higher than those with an other/other (or any-4R) genotype in the all-ethnicities (n = 2,552), Asian, white, and Hispanic samples, respectively. The risk of first sex does not differ between the two genotypes in the African American sample. These results were obtained after adjusting the standard socioeconomic covariates, including gender, parental education, family structure, and community poverty in the regression model. Evidence from both twin and genetic-variant analyses points to a role of genes in the timing of first sexual intercourse.",

Many physical anomalies involving the face, hands, and costovertebral axis have been described in this syndrome. We present twin males with KBG syndrome and a review of 50 published case reports, with particular emphasis on the neurological aspects of KBG syndrome, including seizures, MRI findings, and behavior difficulties. It is argued that diagnostic criteria for KBG syndrome should include neurological involvement, that is, global developmental delay, seizures, and/or mental retardation (MR). The characteristic facial changes and representative hand and costovertebral anomalies are also defined. These diagnostic criteria were obtained from 50 publications and appeared to support the diagnosis in 43 cases. They will be helpful to pediatricians, geneticists, and neurologists in evaluating patients for this condition.",

    "abstract": "Parenting anxiety has been highlighted recently because it tends to be a problem of mother-child relationships and a factor in child maltreatment. Compared to mothers of singletons, it is reported that mothers of twins experience a greater physical and mental burden of parenting. This study aims to investigate whether mothers of twins have more parenting anxiety than those of singletons and whether parenting anxiety affects child's mental development in both twin and singleton groups.\n218 mothers of 0 to 2-year-old twins were recruited at seventeen organizations for twin rearing in Kinki area, western Japan, from March to May 2005. Questionnaires were mailed or handed out to the mothers. In all, 124 mothers of twins (56.9%) returned the questionnaires. 5 data sets were excluded because of twins' cerebral paralysis or other reasons and 119 data sets (96.0%) were analyzed. A total of 348 mothers of singletons were collected at four preschools and two public health centers in the same area from March 2005 to March 2006. Questionnaires were mailed or handed out and were returned by 101 mothers (28.1%). 4 data sets were excluded because of the presence of twins or over age children and 97 data sets (96.0%) were analyzed. The core questionnaires included the JCFRI Child Rearing Support Questionnaire for measurement of parenting anxiety and the Tsumori-Inage Infant Developmental Scale.\n1. Compared to their counterparts with singletons, mothers of twins showed significantly higher scores for parenting anxiety, including general confusion of parenting and negative feelings toward their children. 2. On multiple logistic regression analysis, high parenting anxiety in mothers of 2-year-old twins, especially negative feelings were related to delay in the children's mental development. However, there was no significant relationship with twins aged 0 or 1 year and with singletons of 0 to 2 years of age.\nThe results suggest that negative feelings toward children influence mother-child interactions and complicate relationships. Parenting anxiety is a severe problem in mothers of twins not only because it causes mental problems in mothers but also because it has an impact on child mental development.",

    "abstract": "Src-homology-2 (SH2)-B, a Janus tyrosine kinase 2-interacting protein, has been identified recently as a key regulator of leptin and insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, and body weight in mice. The aim of this study was to determine whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human SH2B gene are associated with these variables. A tagging SNP (tSNP), Ala484Thr (rs7498665), was selected to represent five common SNPs (minor allele frequency > 0.05) in perfect linkage disequilibrium in a 16-kb region encompassing the SH2B gene. The tSNP was genotyped in 2455 white female twins (mean age, 47.4 +/- 12.6 years) from the St. Thomas' United Kingdom Adult Twin Registry (Twins United Kingdom). Ala484Thr (minor allele frequency, 0.38) was associated with serum leptin, total fat, waist circumference, and body weight (P = 0.02 to 0.04). The coding SNP has no predicted effect on protein structure or function and is likely to be in linkage disequilibrium with an as-yet unidentified functional variant in the SH2B gene. Our results support a role for SH2-B in modulating the regulation of body weight and fat by leptin in this female population. If SH2-B signaling is attenuated in diet-induced obesity, it could become a target for drug-induced leptin sensitization.",

    "abstract": "The safety and efficacy of adoptive T-cell transfer (ATT) was tested in the context of viral suppression in syngeneic twins discordant for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Human leucocyte antigen-matched T cells of seven HIV-negative twins were obtained by lymphapheresis and immediately transfused into the HIV-infected sibling. Four twins received 12 ATTs each, with a mean of 2.10 +/- 0.97 x 10(9) CD4(+) T cells and 1.74 +/- 0.81 x 10(9) CD8(+) T cells. Additional transfers were performed in three more twin pairs to study the short-term kinetics of transfused syngeneic T cells. Mean CD4(+) T-cell counts increased significantly, by 0.133 +/- 0.136 x 10(9) cells/l at 1 h and 0.144 +/- 0.12 x 10(9) cells/l at 3 h post-transfusion (P < 0.0001). Short-term kinetic studies suggested a rapid clearance of transferred T cells from the peripheral blood within minutes due to a distribution to marginal pools. After a mean follow up of 39 months, however, a sustained increase of the mean CD4(+) T-cell count was observed (from 0.232 x 10(9) to 0.523 x 10(9) cells/l) without changes of plasma viraemia. We conclude that ATT combined with highly active antiretroviral therapy is safe and leads to a considerable increase in CD4(+) T-cell numbers. The clearance kinetics of the transfused cells from peripheral blood indicates a very rapid regulation of T-cell homeostasis in HIV infection.",

Initial evaluation revealed no other abnormalities apart from their attachment at lower back, buttocks and perineum. They had two separate anal and urogenital openings. Their investigations included roentgenograms, ultrasound, barium enema, cystourethrogram, CT scan and MRI. There were two separate spinal columns fused distally at the lower sacral level. Lower gastrointestinal studies showed two separate rectums and cystourethrogram showed normal and separate urinary tracts. MRI showed a single dural sac between two fused sacral bones with no other vertebral anomalies. They were successfully separated with primary skin closure using V-shaped flaps.",

    "abstract": "The last decade has been marked by the withdrawal from the market of several medicines whose use in patients has been associated with the development of torsade de pointes (TdP), a potentially life-threatening polymorphic tachycardia. In a few cases, TdP can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and lead to sudden death, thus constituting a real problem of public health. The recently finalized ICH S7B guideline defines the prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram as the best biomarker for predicting the torsadogenic risk of a given compound. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that drugs' torsadogenic potential may not necessarily be proportional to their ability to prolong the QT interval. It is a dynamic combination of multiple predisposing factors and components rather than a single particular event that can trigger this particular tachycardia. Following recommendations of the guideline, pharmaceutical companies have intensively implemented methodologies to assess the possible risk of QT prolongation and TdP in humans. The main problem in cardiac safety pharmacology is how best to combine the capabilities of different methodologies with their strengths and limitations in order to detect the potential of one molecular entity to induce a lethal arrhythmia of very low clinical incidence. This publication will review the current methodologies, focusing on the alternative methods to animal experimentation, including an overview of cardiac modeling.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to examine the genetic and environmental contributions to the individual differences in susceptibility to asthma, eczema and rhinitis in childhood and their role in the association among these conditions. Information on asthma, eczema and rhinitis was obtained by parental report. Parents were asked whether a physician had ever diagnosed the condition. Complete data were available for 8,633 5-yr-old twin pairs born between 1986 and 1998. The frequency of parentally reported asthma, eczema and rhinitis was 8.7, 16.8 and 4.4%, respectively, and was higher in males than females. Genetic factors accounted for approximately 90% of the variance in the susceptibility to asthma, eczema and rhinitis. The magnitude of genetic factors did not differ between males and females. The remaining part of the variance was explained by environmental factors not shared by family members. The phenotypic correlations between parentally reported asthma, eczema and rhinitis were moderate and mainly mediated by the same genetic factors. The high heritability and the limited influence of shared environmental factors may point to gene x environment interactions. Future research should focus on this type of interaction processes.",

    "abstract": "Blau syndrome is a hereditary granulomatous disease caused by mutations in the CARD15 gene that is diagnosed in children of young age with exanthema/erythema, arthritis/periarthritis and/or uveitis. We report two cases of Blau syndrome in Danish Caucasian monozygotic male twins, exhibiting a heterozygous de novo R334W mutation in codon 334 of CARD15. The patients were initially diagnosed as having sarcoidosis. In both twins, symptoms (exanthema, arthritis/periarthritis) started at 1 year of age, and were followed by uveitis at 7-10 years of age. There was no involvement of the lungs or other organs. An initial course of standard antituberculous treatment had no effect on the symptoms. Hydroxychloroquine and cyclosporine A were also ineffective, and the latter caused impaired renal function. Partial symptomatic relief was obtained with prednisolone and increased benefit was observed in combination with methotrexate. Subsequent introduction of the TNF-alpha inhibitor eternacept did not discernibly benefit the clinical condition, but was associated with recurrent infections. In contrast, a trial of infliximab therapy demonstrated clinical efficacy and eliminated all symptoms, restoring a high quality of life. At follow up at 20 years of age (after 2-5 years of infliximab treatment) the twins had an almost normal physical appearance and a normal psychomotoric development, indicating a favourable short-term prognosis of the disease. Blau syndrome has pathologic, clinical and therapeutic features in common with sarcoidosis, but rarely involves the lungs or other parenchymatous organs. In children, discrimination between early onset sarcoidosis and Blau syndrome should include a CARD15 mutation analysis.",

    "abstract": "Prospective cohort study of twins.\nTo investigate associations between physical activity, physical function, and incident low back pain (LBP) in an elderly population.\nThe relationship between an active lifestyle and LBP in seniors is unknown.\nParticipants in the population-based Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins free from LBP at baseline (no LBP during the past month) were included, and interview data on physical activity, overall physical function, and LBP at baseline and follow-up were obtained. Associations between levels of physical activity and LBP were estimated using logistic regression for the entire cohort, and using a matched case-control design for twin pairs discordant for physical activity. Absolute risk and relative risks for incident LBP in relation to physical activity were calculated for participants with higher or lower than average physical function at baseline. Absolute risk for LBP was also calculated for participants based on whether they remained active or inactive between baseline and follow-up or changed activity level.\nA total of 1387 persons aged 70-100 at baseline were included in the analyses, including 86 twin pairs discordant for physical activity at baseline. In the total sample, 83% were engaged in light physical activity, and 42% of men and 35% of women were engaged in strenuous physical activity at least weekly. Being engaged in strenuous physical activity at baseline was strongly protective in relation to both having had any LBP (odds ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.37 for intra-pair analysis) and having had LBP lasting more than 30 days altogether during the past year at follow-up (odds ratio 0.08, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.18 for intra-pair analysis). Statistically significant dose-response associations between increasing frequency of strenuous physical activity and magnitude of this protective effect were found. Participants with poor initial physical function experienced the strongest protective effect of strenuous physical activity. Finally, LBP does not appear to be an important factor affecting whether participants remained engaged in strenuous physical activity at baseline and follow-up or vice versa.\nStrenuous physical activity at least once a week is protective for incident LBP in seniors.",

Being engaged in strenuous physical activity at baseline was strongly protective in relation to both having had any LBP (odds ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.37 for intra-pair analysis) and having had LBP lasting more than 30 days altogether during the past year at follow-up (odds ratio 0.08, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.18 for intra-pair analysis). Statistically significant dose-response associations between increasing frequency of strenuous physical activity and magnitude of this protective effect were found. Participants with poor initial physical function experienced the strongest protective effect of strenuous physical activity. Finally, LBP does not appear to be an important factor affecting whether participants remained engaged in strenuous physical activity at baseline and follow-up or vice versa.",

    "abstract": "To study familial and nonfamilial environmental influences on attention problems and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in monozygotic twins discordant and concordant-high and low for these traits.\nNinety-five twin pairs from The Netherlands Twin Register were selected. Longitudinal survey data were collected at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 12 years from parents, twins, and teachers. Mothers participated in a structured clinical interview when twins were between 10 and 17 years of age.\nAffected twins from discordant pairs scored higher than unaffected cotwins on multiple measures of attention problems, ADHD, and other behavior problems according to mother, teacher, and self. Behavioral discordance was evident at age 2 and all subsequent measurements. Compared with unaffected cotwins, affected twins had lower birth weight and delayed physical growth and motor development. Differences between discordant and concordant groups were reported for maternal smoking, sleeping in different rooms, and living with only one parent.\nSignificant markers of ADHD are found in infancy and include low birth weight and delayed motor development. As the knowledge of specific genetic and environmental influences on ADHD increases, future studies may focus on their complex interplay.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated prenatal factors related to perinatal loss in twins, using medical records and death certificates, to determine the main perinatal event that contributed to babies' deaths.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of 550 monochorionic diamniotic or diamniotic dichorionic twins who were delivered at Kaiser Permanente Colorado between 1994 and 2001.\nThe main outcome of the study was perinatal loss (stillbirth or neonatal death).\nSelect maternal risk factors (maternal age, race, marital status, assisted conception, past history of preterm birth, cigarette smoking, and placentation) were included in the univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Data on these risk factors came from review of records from our multiple-birth perinatal database. A comprehensive review of clinical events recorded in the medical records and on the death certificate was conducted to assess the main event that contributed to the loss.\nIn the cohort of 1100 babies, there were 12 stillbirths and 34 neonatal deaths, with an overall frequency of perinatal loss of 4.2%. We found a strong association between a monochorionic diamniotic placentation and perinatal loss (adjusted odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 2, 7.7). At delivery, placental pathology and spontaneous preterm birth accounted for 36% and 41%, respectively, of the clinical events contributing to the demises. Compared with the medical record, review of death certificate information did not contribute significantly to the understanding of the sequence of perinatal events leading to the demise.\nWe conclude that loss in twins is most strongly associated with monochorionic diamniotic placentation. Although this condition is not preventable, early identification (by ultrasound) and referral to subspecialists may decrease the chances of perinatal loss. Prevention of spontaneous preterm birth in all women remains an important initiative in obstetric care to reduce perinatal mortality and neonatal morbidity. We believe that improvements in the reporting on death certificates will allow future research on large data sets and may provide further insight into perinatal loss in twins. We emphasize the importance of a comprehensive clinical review of each case of perinatal loss to fully understand the sequence of clinical events leading to this adverse pregnancy outcome.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective review of twin gestations was undertaken to evaluate whether routine cervical lengths (CLs) in such instances change pregnancy outcome. Data were collected from the ultrasound database and chart review. Exclusion criteria included twins reduced to singletons, twins not delivering at our institution, and incomplete information. Twin gestations with a CL were compared with those without a CL. Outcomes of interest included gestational age (GA) at delivery, preterm delivery (PTD), antepartum admissions, antepartum length of stay (LOS), cerclage placement, birthweight, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and neonatal LOS. Two hundred sixty-two patients met inclusion criteria. Of those, 184 had CLs and 78 did not. Comparing the CL to the no-CL group, there were no differences with respect to GA at delivery (34.8 versus 35.3 weeks; p=0.35), antepartum admissions (32.1 versus 23.1%; p=0.16), cerclage placement (7.1 versus 1.3%; p=0.06), or tocolysis use (28.6 versus 21.8%; p=0.26). There was no difference between the two groups with respect to preterm labor (26 versus 19%; p=0.25), PTD < 28 weeks (8.2 versus 3.9%; p=0.21), PTD < 34 weeks (26.1 versus 25.6%; p=0.94), or PTD < 37 weeks (76.1 versus 70.5%; p=0.34). The only significant difference was antepartum LOS (34.5 versus 31.3 days; p< 0.001). There were no differences in neonatal outcomes. Routine CL did not improve perinatal outcome but increased maternal antepartum LOS.",

    "abstract": "Gametic selection during fertilization or the effects of specific genotypes on the viability of embryos may cause a skewed transmission of chromosomes to surviving offspring. A recent analysis of transmission distortion in humans reported significant excess sharing among full siblings. Dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs are a special case of the simultaneous survival of two genotypes, and there have been reports of DZ pairs with excess allele sharing around the HLA locus, a candidate locus for embryo survival. We performed an allele-sharing study of 1,592 DZ twin pairs from two independent Australian cohorts, of which 1,561 pairs were informative for linkage on chromosome 6. We also analyzed allele sharing in 336 DZ twin pairs from The Netherlands. We found no evidence of excess allele sharing, either at the HLA locus or in the rest of the genome. In contrast, we found evidence of a small but significant (P=.003 for the Australian sample) genomewide deficit in the proportion of two alleles shared identical by descent among DZ twin pairs. We reconciled conflicting evidence in the literature for excess genomewide allele sharing by performing a simulation study that shows how undetected genotyping errors can lead to an apparent deficit or excess of allele sharing among sibling pairs, dependent on whether parental genotypes are known. Our results imply that gene-mapping studies based on affected sibling pairs that include DZ pairs will not suffer from false-positive results due to loci involved in embryo survival.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we examined the contamination levels of organochlorines and the patterns of gene expressions using umbilical cords of twins. The contamination levels of total PCBs, HCB and HCHs of intra-pair of twins were close to each other, but that of DDTs were not so as the others. It shows that the placental or fetal factor may influence the transfer or the accumulation of DDTs. The patterns of gene expressions of intra-pair of twins were similar to each other. It may because the environmental factor (sharing same mother), genetic factor or the both of twins are similar. This study gave us some information to understand the fetal exposure to organochlorines. Moreover, it showed the possibility that the pattern of gene expression in umbilical cord reflected the intra-uterine environment. However, the information from general pattern of the gene expression is limited. Therefore, further investigation is necessary to find new markers not only mRNA but also protein to estimate the effects of fetal exposure of multiple organochlorines.",

    "abstract": "Depression is associated with smoking, but the causality of the relationship is debated. The authors examine smoking behaviour as a predictor of depression among the Finnish adult twin population.\nBased on responses to surveys in 1975 and 1981, the authors characterized the subjects as never smokers, persistent former smokers, quitters, recurrent smokers and persistent smokers. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was applied in 1990 to measure depression (BDI score >9). Although the population consisted of twins, the authors first considered the subjects as individuals. Logistic regression models were computed for 4164 men and 4934 women. In order to control for family and genetic background, conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted among twin pairs discordant for depression. Bivariate genetic modelling was used to examine genetic and environmental components of the correlation between smoking and depression.\nAmong the men, persistent smoking (OR 1 x 42, 95% CI 1 x 07-1 x 89) and smoking in 1975 but quitting by 1981 (OR 1 x 68, 95% CI 1 x 17-2 x 42) was associated with a higher risk of depression, while among the women only the quitters had an elevated risk (OR 1 x 38, 96% CI 1 x 01-1 x 87). The gender x smoking interaction showed persistent smoking to be a stronger risk for men. When family and genetic background were controlled, smoking remained a predictor of depression. Genetic modelling among the men suggested a modest correlation (rg=0 x 25) between genetic components of smoking and depression.\nSmoking behaviour may be a gender-sensitive predictor of depression, the stronger association in men being partly accounted for by having underlying genes in common.",

    "abstract": "Previous work using quantified EEG has suggested that brain activity in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and normal persons differs. Our objective was to investigate if specific frequency band-pass regions and spatial locations are associated with CFS using low-resolution electromagnetic brain tomography (LORETA).\nWe conducted a co-twin control study of 17 pairs of monozygotic twins where 1 twin met criteria for CFS and the co-twin was healthy. Twins underwent an extensive battery of tests including a structured psychiatric interview and a quantified EEG. Eyes closed EEG frequency-domain analysis was computed and the entire brain volume was compared of the CFS and healthy twins using a multiple comparison procedure.\nCompared with their healthy co-twins, twins with CFS differed in current source density. The CFS twins had higher delta in the left uncus and parahippocampal gyrus and higher theta in the cingulate gyrus and right superior frontal gyrus.\nThese findings suggest that neurophysiological activity in specific areas of the brain may differentiate individuals with CFS from those in good health. The study corroborates that slowing of the deeper structures of the limbic system is associated with affect. It also supports the neurobiological model that the right forebrain is associated with sympathetic activity and the left forebrain with the effective management of energy. These preliminary findings await replication.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the relationship between the principle of double effect and justification for separation surgeries for conjoined twins. First, the principle of double effect is examined in light of its historical context. It is argued that it can only operate under an absolutist view of good and evil that is compatible with the Bible. Given this foundation for application, scenarios for separating conjoined twins are considered against the criteria for the principle of double effect. It is concluded that the principle of double effect cannot be applied to cases wherein one of the twins must be killed. However, it is noted that this does not leave decision makers without options.",

Active monitoring with daily BPP was undertaken, once the estimated fetal weights (EFW) was >or= 500 g and at a gestational age of >or= 24 weeks in both twins. Delivery was timed on the basis of an abnormal BPP, two equivocal BPP within 12 h or gestational age of >or= 32(+0) weeks.\nTwenty-two MC and 17 DC twin pregnancies were identified. There were no fetal losses in the viable actively monitored MC (19) and DC (13) twins. There was a longer latency interval in the MC group at 21.7 days versus 14.4 days in the DC group (p = 0.13). Delivery was indicated for an abnormal BPP (57.8% MC vs 30.8% DC).\nA strategy of daily BPP can be used to monitor preterm twin fetuses with AREDF, prolonging pregnancy with an acceptable perinatal outcome.",

    "abstract": "An anomalous origin of the coronary arteries had been implicated as a cause of sudden cardiac death in a case involving a 16-year-old student who suddenly collapsed while running track at school. An autopsy revealed that the right coronary artery arose from the aorta in the left sinus of Valsalva. In order to determine whether the same anomaly was inherent in his brother--an identical twin--a complete cardiac medical examination was conducted. Multi-detector-row computed tomography (MDCT) coronary angiography showed no anomaly at the sinus of Valsalva, which indicates that the anomaly, in this case, was not hereditary. This case exemplifies instances where forensic medicine may intervene to prevent sudden deaths in surviving family members.",

    "abstract": "Current biological psychiatric models assume that genetic and environmental risk factors for anxiety and depression act on the same brain structures.\nTo test this assumption, we assessed brain anatomy by using optimized voxel-based morphometry on magnetic resonance images obtained in monozygotic twin pairs who were discordant for the risk of anxiety and depression (n = 10 pairs) and in monozygotic twin pairs who were concordant for high (n = 7 pairs) or low (n = 15 pairs) risk for anxiety and depression.\nWe observed volume reductions in the temporal lobe, most notably in the left posterior hippocampal region in subjects at high risk for anxiety and depression, but exclusively in the intrapair comparison of discordant monozygotic twins. Because monozygotic twins are genetically identical, any discordance in their risk for anxiety and depression and hippocampal volume must arise from differential exposure to environmental influences. A group comparison between pairs concordant for low or high risk, which is more likely to reflect differences in genetic vulnerability, did not show reduced temporal-lobe and posterior hippocampal volumes in the pairs at high risk for anxiety and depression.\nThis pattern of results suggests that damage to temporal-lobe structures may be specific to an environmentally driven etiology of anxiety and depression.",

    "abstract": "The differences between right (RH) and left (LH) handers reported in the literature on fine motor tasks, has traditionally been interpreted relative to purported functioning of the cerebral hemispheres. However, conclusive evidence for performance differences which are intrinsic to handedness per se is difficult to obtain unless left and right handers are compared who are similar in their genetic and environmental background. The present study therefore, employed a monozygotic (MZ) twin design which minimizes differences in genetic variation between the two groups. Forty female monozygotic twins (20 pairs) were selected on the basis of discordance of writing hand. Their laterality preferences were assessed and they were tested for differences on hand performance tasks (dot filling, finger tapping, and peg moving). The results revealed that on the hand and foot preference inventories, the right-handers were more strongly lateralized than their left-handed sisters, and that the left-handers had greater variation in their laterality scores. There were substantial correlations between preference and performance scores. The analyses not only revealed the obvious strong main effects of writing hand on performance tasks, but interaction effects of handedness on the peg-moving task. The dot filling task differentiated the writing versus non-writing hand considerably better than either of the other two performance tasks. However, no evidence was found to indicate that twins who wrote with their left hands showed poorer performance than their right-handed twin sisters.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have examined the effect of in utero exposure to smoking and fecundity among the offspring but the findings are contradictory. We therefore studied the waiting time to first pregnancy (TTP) and exposure to smoking in utero and childhood among Danish twins born between 1931 and 1952. Information about TTP, exposure to mothers smoking in pregnancy, exposure to smoking in childhood and current smoking among the male twins and smoking in their own pregnancy among female twins was collected by interview. Fecundability odds ratio (FOR) estimating the odds of conception in a cycle among exposed compared to the unexposed were calculated separately for female and male twins. A total of 1653 female and 1598 male twins reported a TTP. Female twins, exposed in utero, had reduced fecundability after control for confounders (FOR = 0.81; 95% CI 0.67-0.99). A nonsignificant increase in fecundity among male twins exposed to smoking in utero was found (FOR = 1.12; 95% CI 0.89-1.40). Among dizygotic twins of opposite sex sharing the same in utero exposures, the future fecundity of the male twin was unaffected by in utero exposure (FOR = 0.97; 95% CI 0.60-1.55) whereas the female twin had reduced fecundity (FOR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.47-0.91). This study supports that smoking is hazardous to the female fetus not only in the short term but also affects her future ability to conceive and makes it even more important to advise pregnant women to stop smoking.",

Untreated facial areas (eg, nasolabial folds) showed comparable aging in both twins. Neither twin experienced adverse effects.\nLong-term treatment with Botox can prevent the development of imprinted facial lines that are visible at rest. Botox treatment can also reduce crow's feet. Treatment is well tolerated, with no adverse events reported during 13 years of regular treatment in this study.",

    "abstract": "Autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells directed against CNS autoantigens may play a role in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). Identical twins share the same genetic background but not the TCR repertoire that is shaped by the encounter with self or foreign antigens. To gain insights into the interplay between MS and T cell repertoire, peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and their CCR7+/CCR7- subsets from five pairs of identical twins (four discordant and one concordant for MS; none of which had taken disease-modifying therapy) were compared by TCR beta-chain (TCRB) complementary-determining region 3 (CDR3) spectratyping. CD4+ T cells generally showed a Gaussian distribution, whereas CD8+ T cells exhibited subject-specific, widely skewed TCR spectratypes. There was no correlation between CD8+ T cell oligoclonality and disease. Sequencing of predominant spectratype expansions revealed shared TCRB-CDR3 motifs when comparing inter- and/or intrapair twin members. In many cases, these sequences were homologous to published TCRs, specific for viruses implicated in MS pathogenesis, CNS autoantigens, or copaxone [glatiramer acetate (GA)], implying the occurrence of naturally GA-responding CD8+ T cells. It is notable that these expanded T cell clones with putative pathogenic or regulatory properties were present in the affected as well as in the healthy subject, thus suggesting the existence of a \"MS predisposing trait\" shared by co-twins discordant for MS.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of cross-gender behavior during childhood, to estimate the influence of genotype and environment on variation in cross-gender behavior, and to explore the association of cross-gender behavior with maternal ratings of behavior problems as indexed by the Internalizing and Externalizing scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Cross-gender behavior was assessed by two items from the CBCL: \"behaves like opposite sex\" and \"wishes to be of opposite sex.\" As part of an ongoing longitudinal study of the Netherlands Twin Registry, mothers were asked to complete the CBCL for their twins when they were 7 (n approximately 14,000 twins) and 10 years old (n approximately 8,500 twins). The prevalence of cross-gender behavior (as measured by maternal report of behaving like or wishing to be the opposite sex) was 3.2% and 5.2% for 7-year-old boys and girls, respectively, and decreased to 2.4% and 3.3% for 10-year-old boys and girls. Surprisingly, the prevalence rate of cross-gender behavior of girls with a male co-twin was lower than of girls with a female co-twin. At both ages, the similarity for cross-gender behavior was greater in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins pairs. Genetic structural equation modeling showed that 70% of the variance in the liability of cross-gender behavior could be explained by genetic factors, at both ages and for both sexes. Cross-gender behavior was associated with higher scores on Internalizing and Externalizing problems, both in boys and in girls.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic male twins, carrying the same number of trinucleotide repeats in the IT 15 Huntington disease (HD) gene, showed a different clinical course. Patient 1 presented with anxiety and chorea at the age of 40. Patient 2 showed persecution paranoia and motor impersistence at the age of 42. Both patients were monitored for 30 months using currently recommended motor and behaviour scales. No differences were observed in motor scoring besides small interevaluation fluctuations. However, on the cognitive and behaviour scales, patient 1 showed a significant worsening when compared with patient 2. Our cases support the belief that the motor symptoms and signs in HD are highly dependent on the trinucleotide expansion. However, the differences in the evolution of mental status in our patients suggest that other still unknown environmental factors are important in the phenotypic expression of Huntington's disease.",

    "abstract": "Combinations of molecular tags visible in light and electron microscopes become particularly advantageous in the analysis of dynamic cellular components like the Golgi apparatus. This organelle disassembles at the onset of mitosis and, after a sequence of poorly understood events, reassembles after cytokinesis. The precise location of Golgi membranes and resident proteins during mitosis remains unclear, partly due to limitations of molecular markers and the resolution of light microscopy. We generated a fusion consisting of the first 117 residues of alpha-mannosidase II tagged with a fluorescent protein and a tetracysteine motif. The mannosidase component guarantees docking into the Golgi membrane, with the tags exposed in the lumen. The fluorescent protein is optically visible without further treatment, whereas the tetracysteine tag can be reduced acutely with a membrane-permeant phosphine, labeled with ReAsH, monitored in the light microscope, and used to trigger the photoconversion of diaminobenzidine, allowing 4D optical recording on live cells and correlated ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy. These methods reveal that Golgi reassembly is preceded by the formation of four colinear clusters at telophase, two per daughter cell. Within each daughter, the smaller cluster near the midbody gradually migrates to rejoin the major cluster on the far side of the nucleus and asymmetrically reconstitutes a single Golgi apparatus, first in one daughter cell and then in the other. Our studies provide previously undescribed insights into Golgi disassociation and reassembly during mitosis and offer a powerful approach to follow recombinant protein distribution in 4D imaging and correlated high-resolution analysis.",

    "abstract": "Studies investigating the association between cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive decline report discrepant outcomes. The co-twin control method improves on traditional case-control approaches by controlling for within-twin pair similarities of genetic and early environmental influences.\nTo examine the association of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and elevated body mass index (BMI) (>30 kg/m(2)), individually and combined, with cognitive decline over a 12-year period in members of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council Twin Registry of World War II male veterans.\nModified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-m) was administered four times at approximately 4-year intervals from 1990 to 2002 as part of an epidemiologic study of dementia. Self-report medical information was collected from 1996 to 2002. We examined the difference in cognitive decline within twin pairs discordant for the vascular risk factors while controlling for baseline TICS-m, education, smoking, and alcohol history.\nAmong twin pairs discordant for diabetes (n = 177), the diabetic twins declined an average of almost 1 point more than their nondiabetic co-twins (p = 0.018) at the last screening time point. Further analyses showed that this was in large part due to greater decline among older men (age 76 to 84 years). Cognitive change was not significantly different between members of pairs discordant for hypertension (n = 326), hypercholesterolemia (n = 282), or elevated BMI (n = 166).\nBased on this study of twin pairs who share similar genetic and early environmental risks for cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes is associated with greater cognitive decline, particularly among the oldest individuals.",

    "abstract": "Several functional neuroimaging studies have implicated the cerebellar vermis in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but there have been no structural neuroimaging studies of this brain structure in PTSD. We utilized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with manual tracing to quantify the volumes of three divisions of the mid-sagittal vermis, and their total, within an identical, co-twin control design that employed Vietnam veterans discordant for combat exposure in Vietnam. Each structure's volume was significantly correlated between twins, indicating a partial familial determination: for anterior superior vermis, r=0.73; for posterior superior vermis, r=0.47; for inferior posterior vermis, r=0.51; and for total vermis, r=0.57. There were no significant differences between the PTSD and non-PTSD veterans for any vermis volume, and no significant main effects or interactions when their non-combat-exposed co-twins were added to the analyses. Thus, the results do not support the structural abnormality of cerebellar vermis in combat-related PTSD.",

    "abstract": "Neuroticism is widely used as an explanatory concept in etiological research of psychopathology. In order to clarify what neuroticism actually represents, we investigated the genetic association between neuroticism and cardiovascular measures.\nIn 125 female twin pairs (18-30 years), electrocardiogram and continuous finger blood pressure were assessed during two rest and two mental stress conditions. Mean values for baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), heart rate variability (HRV) and inter-beat interval (IBI) were calculated for each condition. Neuroticism was assessed by multiple questionnaires. Multivariate genetic model-fitting analyses were used to investigate the genetic correlation between latent neuroticism and the cardiovascular autonomic nervous system (ANS) measures.\nNeuroticism was negatively correlated to BRS and HRV. Neuroticism was not correlated to IBI. For BRS, this phenotypical relation was entirely determined by shared genetic influences. For HRV, the genetic contribution to the phenotypical correlation was not significant, but the proportions of explained covariance showed a trend of more genetic than environmental influences on the phenotypical relationship.\nHigh neuroticism is associated with a deregulated ANS. Pleiotropic genetic effects may be partly responsible for this effect.",

    "abstract": "Atopic traits often co-occur and this can potentially be caused by common aetiological relationships between traits, i.e. a common genetic or a common environmental background.\nTo estimate to what extent the same genetic and environmental factors influence wheeze, rhinitis, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR), and positive skin prick test (posSPT) in a sample of adult twins.\nWithin a sampling frame of 21,162 twin subjects, 20-49 years of age, from the Danish Twin Registry, a total of 575 subjects (256 intact pairs and 63 single twins), who either themselves and/or their co-twins reported a history of asthma at a nationwide questionnaire survey, were clinically examined. Symptoms of wheeze and rhinitis were obtained by interview; airway responsiveness and skin test reactivity were measured using standard techniques. Correlations in liability between the different traits were estimated and latent factor models of genetic and environmental effects were fitted to the observed data using maximum likelihood methods.\nThe various phenotypic correlations between wheeze, rhinitis, AHR and posSPT were all significant and ranged between 0.50 and 0.86. Traits that showed highest genetic correlations were wheeze-rhinitis (rho(A)=0.95), wheeze-AHR (rho(A)=0.85) and rhinitis-posSPT (rho(A)=0.92), whereas lower genetic correlations were observed for rhinitis-AHR (rho(A)=0.43) and AHR-posSPT (rho(A)=0.59). Traits with a high degree of environmental sharing were rhinitis-posSPT (rho(E)=0.92) and wheeze-posSPT (rho(E)=0.71), whereas a lower environmental correlation was seen for wheeze-rhinitis (rho(E)=0.25). The estimates were corrected for ascertainment and adjusted for age, sex, inhaled corticosteroids and smoking.\nDifferent atopic conditions share, to a large extent, a common genetic background. In particular, upper and lower respiratory symptoms seem to be different phenotypic expressions of a common set of genes. These results add new insight into the origins of clinical heterogeneity within atopy and should stimulate the search for pleiotropic genes of importance for these conditions.",

Molecular genetic analysis excluded mutations in PMP22, connexin32, MPZ, LITAF and MFNZ genes, as well as duplication and deletion of PMP22.\nThe twins were employed in PVC production and developed symptoms after 14 years of massive exposure. We think that the heavy exposure to various neurotoxic compounds caused symptoms that mimic late-onset CMT. However, the twins had distal dysesthesia which is unusual in inherited neuropathies. This illustrates the importance of an occupational history even in the molecular genetic era.",

    "abstract": "Elevated levels of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and airway hyperresponsiveness are intermediate phenotypes of asthma. Using population-based data collected from a sample of twins, the present authors estimated the relative contribution of genes, family environment and nonshared environmental influences to variations in eNO and airway responsiveness (AR). In addition, the genetic and environmental sources of covariation between these two asthma-related phenotypes were investigated. The study population comprised a random sample of 377 adult twins identified through the Norwegian Twin Registry. The main outcome variables were eNO and AR to methacholine. Genetic effects accounted for 60% of the variation in eNO. Family environment accounted for 30% of the variation in AR, while nonshared environmental influences explained the remaining variation for both measures. For both eNO and AR, there were significant regression effects for atopy and smoking. The small, but significant association between eNO and AR was primarily explained by genetic factors. Sub-analyses restricted to atopic and nonsmoking twins strengthened the observation. In conclusion, variations in exhaled nitric oxide and airway responsiveness appear to be explained by different genetic and environmental variance structures. Variation in exhaled nitric oxide is explained by genetic and nonshared environmental effects, whereas an environmental model best explains the variation in airway responsiveness. Common genetic effects explain the small but significant association between exhaled nitric oxide and airway responsiveness.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins represent a rare but fascinating congenital condition, the aetiology of which remains obscure. Over the past four decades, the paediatric surgeons at Red Cross Children's Hospital have been involved in the management of 46 pairs of conjoined twins, of which 33 have been symmetrical and 12 asymmetrical. Seventeen symmetrical twins have undergone separation with 22 children (65%) surviving; all of the live asymmetrical twins survived separation. We describe the important features of this unique cohort, outline our approach to management and present the results of this approach. We consider some of the ethical and moral dilemmas we have confronted, and discuss the prenatal diagnosis, obstetric implications and postnatal care of these children, including the relevant investigations and anaesthetic and surgical management. Specific aspects related to the cardiovascular system, hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal tracts, urogenital tract, central nervous system and musculoskeletal system are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "The use of cannabis and other illicit drugs (OIDs) and their co-morbid misuse are frequently reported in the literature. Correlated vulnerabilities and causal or gateway influences have been implicated in this association. We investigated the source of this co-morbidity between cannabis use (experimentation, early and repeated use, and problems) and OID experimentation and problems using genetic models proposed by Neale and Kendler (American Journal of Human Genetics 1995, 57, 935-953).\nIn a sample of 4152 same-sex male and female adult Australian twin individuals, we fit 13 genetically informative models of co-morbidity to data on experimentation, early use, repeated use of cannabis and co-morbid OID experimentation, and to abuse/dependence (A/D) problems with cannabis and OIDs.\nModel-fitting results suggest that common genetic, shared and unique environmental factors are responsible for the association between cannabis experimentation, early use, repeated use and A/D problems and OID experimentation or problems. The liability causation model, which is a reduced form of the correlated vulnerabilities model, also fit very well. In women, we found evidence for high-risk cannabis experimenters and repeated users to be at increased risk for OID experimentation, despite being below the risk threshold on the liability distribution for OID experimentation (extreme multiformity).\nCo-morbid cannabis and OID use and misuse are due partly to a common predisposition to substance use disorders. Putative causal effects could not be ruled out. These models warrant further research, so that features of the correlated vulnerabilities model and the gateway models can be studied jointly in a single series of adaptive nested models.",

The objectives of this study were: (i) to sort the sperm into X- and Y-enriched populations and (ii) use the sorted sperm for in vitro fertilization (IVF) to produce sex-preselected embryo and offspring. The results revealed that the accuracy of sorted X- and Y-sperm was 94% and 89%, respectively. There was a decrease in blastocyst development rate in IVF with sorted sperm comparing to unsorted sperm, but the percentage of blastocysts on D6-D8 was not statistically different. Transplantation of the presumed X-embryos derived from IVF into a recipient resulted in the birth of female twins. These results indicated the feasibility of sperm sorting by flow cytometry and in vitro production of sex-preselected embryos and offspring in buffalo.",

    "abstract": "Supine weight-bearing exercise within lower body negative pressure (LBNP) alleviates some of the skeletal deconditioning induced by simulated weightlessness in men. We examined this potential beneficial effect in women. Because dietary acid load affected the degree of bone resorption in men during bed rest, we also investigated this variable in women. Subjects were 7 pairs of female identical twins assigned at random to 2 groups, sedentary bed rest (control) or bed rest with supine treadmill exercise within LBNP. Dietary intake was controlled and monitored. Urinary calcium and markers of bone resorption were measured before bed rest and on bed rest days 5/6, 12/13, 19/20, and 26/27. Bone mineral content was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry before and after bed rest. Data were analyzed by repeated-measures two-way analysis of variance. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to define the relationships between diet and markers of bone metabolism and to estimate heritability of markers. During bed rest, all markers of bone resorption and urinary calcium and phosphorus increased (P<0.001); parathyroid hormone (P=0.06), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P=0.06), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (P=0.09) tended to decrease. LBNP exercise tended to mitigate bone density loss. The ratio of dietary animal protein to potassium was positively correlated with urinary calcium excretion for all weeks of bed rest in the control group, but only during weeks 1 and 3 in the exercise group. Pre-bed rest data suggested that many markers of bone metabolism have strong genetic determinants. Treadmill exercise within LBNP had less of a protective effect on bone resorption during bed rest in women than previously published results had shown for its effect in men, but the same trends were observed for both sexes. Dietary acid load of these female subjects was significantly correlated with calcium excretion but not with other bone resorption markers.",

    "abstract": "In an effort to investigate the molecular basis of growth discordance in embryos that experience the same uterine environment, we compared telomerase activity and apoptosis in placental trophoblasts obtained from growth discordant twins. Between January 2003 and February 2005, placental tissue from twenty pairs of twins was obtained within thirty minutes of delivery. Eleven cases were classified as growth discordant, with birth weight discordance greater than 20%. Nine cases comprised the control group, with less than 20% discordance. Telomerase and apoptotic activities in placental trophoblasts were analyzed by ELISA and immunoblot. Statistical significance was analyzed by a paired t-test, chi- squared test, and ANOVA (SPSS ver 11.0). The average growth discordance was 26.8% in the growth discordant group and 14.4% in the control group. There were no significant differences in maternal age, week of gestation at delivery, parity, or chorionisity between the two groups. In the growth discordant group, the larger twin showed significantly higher telomerase activity (p < 0.01), whereas no significant difference was observed in the control group (p = 0.36). In addition, there was no definitive correlation between telomerase activity and the degree of growth discordance in the larger or smaller twins (R = -0.521 and -0.399, p = 0.15 and 0.25, respectively). The apoptosis proteins Bax and Bcl 2 were detected in both the larger and smaller twins in the growth discordant and control groups. There was no statistically significant difference in Bax expression between the larger and smaller twins (p = 0.25 and 0.92, respectively) for either the growth discordant or the control groups. Bcl 2 expression also showed no significant difference between groups. In conclusion, a tendency toward reduced telomerase activity and increased apoptosis was discovered in placental trophoblasts of the smaller growth- discordant twin, possibility resulting in delayed fetal growh.",

    "abstract": "Premature ovarian failure (POF) before 40 years of age from natural causes affects approximately 1% of adult women, with minor variations between ethnic groups. A recent case of ovarian transplantation between young monozygotic (MZ) twins in which one had undergone unexplained POF at 14 years has prompted a study of the prevalence of POF.\nMenopausal ages of 832 Australian and UK female twin-pairs were extracted from volunteer national twin registry databases containing medical, reproductive and lifestyle data surveyed by mail questionnaire. Surgical menopause was an exclusion criterion.\nThe prevalence of POF in both MZ and dizygotic (DZ) twins was similar in both registries and 3- to 5-fold greater than the general population at age thresholds 40 and 45 years. No specific factors were found to account for the higher risk of early menopause. Some twins of both zygosities were highly discordant for menopausal age (>or=10 years). Nevertheless, there was significant intra-twin dependence, especially for MZ twins, and the average age difference at last menses was greater in DZ twin-pairs.\nBoth MZ and DZ twins are at higher risk of POF. Despite some striking differences within MZ twin-pairs, menopausal ages were more concordant than for DZ twin-pairs, confirming that the timing of menopause has a heritable component.",

    "abstract": "To examine the effect of occupational characteristics on cognitive status change in members of the NAS-NRC Twins Registry of World War II veterans.\nParticipants completed the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-m) on three occasions spanning a period of approximately 7 years. Based on factor analysis, occupational characteristics were interpreted as reflecting general intellectual demands (GI), human interaction and communication (HC), physical exertion (PE), and visual attention (VA).\nBased on regression analysis of TICS-m change that was dependent on twin pairing and additionally covarying for education, age at each testing event, medical conditions, and initial TICS-m score, higher GI was associated with a modest longitudinal improvement in TICS-m performance, whereas higher PE and VA were both associated with a modest decline. Subsequent analysis revealed that these significant effects were present among dizygotic twins, but not among monozygotic twins.\nPrevious findings of a relationship between occupational characteristics and cognitive performance in later life may be partially explained by genetic factors; however, until these genes are identified, occupational characteristics may be useful markers.",

    "abstract": "Exposure of the fetus to indomethacin by administration of the drug to the mother may cause many side effects, including premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Hypoxia is a predisposing factor for premature ductal closure and often occurs after maternal indomethacin therapy. We present two sets of monozygotic twins with twin-to-twin transfusion, where in utero ductal closure occurred in the donor twin while the recipient twin appeared unaffected. This selective closure of the ductus arteriosus suggests that the affected twin was predisposed to hypoxia and thus was more susceptible to ductal closure in response to indomethacin exposure.",

    "abstract": "Exercise is considered to be beneficial for free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism, although reports of the effects of increased physical activity on FFA uptake and oxidation in different tissues in vivo in humans have been inconsistent. To investigate the heredity-independent effects of physical activity and fitness on FFA uptake in skeletal muscle, the myocardium, and liver we used positron emission tomography (PET) in nine healthy young male monozygotic twin pairs discordant for physical activity and fitness. The cotwins with higher physical activity constituting the more active group had a similar body mass index but less body fat and 18 +/- 10% higher (P < 0.001) compared to the less active brothers with lower physical activity. Low-intensity knee-extension exercise increased skeletal muscle FFA and oxygen uptake six to 10 times compared to resting values but no differences were observed between the groups at rest or during exercise. At rest the more active group had lower hepatic FFA uptake compared to the less active group (5.5 +/- 4.3 versus 9.0 +/- 6.1 micromol (100 ml)(-1) min(-1), P = 0.04). Hepatic FFA uptake associated significantly with body fat percentage (P = 0.05). Myocardial FFA uptake was similar between the groups. In conclusion, in the absence of the confounding effects of genetic factors, moderately increased physical activity and aerobic fitness decrease body adiposity even in normal-weighted healthy young adult men. Further, increased physical activity together with decreased intra-abdominal adiposity seems to decrease hepatic FFA uptake but has no effects on skeletal muscle or myocardial FFA uptake.",

    "abstract": "Depressive personality disorder (DPD) was introduced in DSM-IV as a new category requiring further study. The aim of this study was to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to DPD in a population-based twin sample, and include data on criteria performance, prevalence and diagnostic overlap.\nAxis I and Axis II diagnoses were obtained by structured interviews in a population-based sample of 2794 young adult twins. Statistical analyses included correlation and factor analysis based on polychoric correlation coefficients, and diagnostic overlap applying adjusted odds ratios. Contributions from additive genetic and common and unique environmental influences to the liability to DPD were computed using structural equation modelling, applying a multiple threshold variable.\nLiability to DPD could best be explained by additive genetic and unique environmental factors, with heritability estimates of 49% (95% CI 0.41-0.57) in females and 25% (95% CI 0.12-0.40) in males. The best-fitting model indicated that some of the genes contributing to DPD differ between men and women. Chronbach's alpha was 0.87. 2.0% of participants fulfilled the criteria for DPD, and overlap was most pronounced for dysthymic disorder and avoidant personality disorder.\nLow prevalence rates and subsequent inclusion of subthreshold criteria could have influenced parameter estimates, especially in males.\nDPD was almost twice as heritable in females as in males, comparable to previous studies on major depression. The proposed criteria showed good measurement properties, and DPD was not completely subsumed within any other disorder.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of the prevalence of tooth grinding in children range considerably, reflecting different methods of recording. The main aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of tooth grinding in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs by assessing wear faceting on the primary canines, and to compare the faceting on the right and left to determine whether children have a side preference for grinding.\nThe sample consisted of 116 MZ twin pairs and 124 dizygous DZ twin pairs, all participants in an ongoing study of dento-facial development at the dental schools in Adelaide and Melbourne. Evidence of wear faceting on primary maxillary and mandibular canine tips was recorded from dental casts, and the side with the larger wear facet recorded. Types of occlusal relationship, handedness, zygosity and gender were also recorded, and associations between variables analysed statistically.\nCanine tip wear facets were found in 100 per cent of the sample, and grinding was lateralized in 59 per cent of children. MZ twin pairs showed a higher discordance for grinding side preference than DZ twin pairs (33.8 per cent compared with 16.8 per cent), providing evidence of a mirror-imaging effect for grinding side preference. There was no strong evidence that individuals had the same preference for grinding side and handedness, although right-handers (RH) showed a preference for a grinding side more often than non-right-handers (NRH) (63.6 per cent compared with 51.2 per cent), consistent with previous findings that RHs display more cerebral lateralization than NRHs.\nTooth grinding appears to be a universal phenomenon in children and is commonly expressed more on one side than the other. The significantly higher discordance for grinding side preference in MZ twin pairs compared with DZ twin pairs may reflect a mirror-imaging effect in the former. However, at present we have no evidence to suggest that handedness and preferred tooth grinding side are associated.",

    "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that the bone metabolism of a growth-restricted foetus is regulated by genetic, placental and/or foetal factors through leptin, we investigated the foetal bone turnover in monochorionic pregnancies complicated with or without twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).\nMaternal and cord bloods were collected from gestational-age-matched monochorionic twins with (n=15) and without (n=15) TTTS. The samples were assayed for leptin, cross-linked carboxyl terminal telo-peptide (ICTP, a marker of bone resorption) and pro-peptide (PICP, a marker of bone formation) of type I collagen by radioimmunoassay (RIA).\nIn the growth-restricted donor twin, the plasma concentration of leptin (P < 0.001), PICP (P < 0.001) was lower, while that of ICTP (P < 0.001) was higher than the recipient twin of the TTTS group. In contrast, leptin, PICP and ICTP were comparable in non-TTTS twins. In the recipient twin of TTTS and non-TTTS twins, leptin was positively associated with PICP (r=0.73; n=45, P < 0.001) and negatively with ICTP (r=-0.68; n=45; P < 0.001). No such association was found between leptin and bone marker in the growth-restricted donor twin of the TTTS group.\nOur data suggest that, in AGA twins, leptin maintains bone metabolism by inhibiting resorption and enhancing bone formation. In contrast, growth-restricted donor twins have high bone turnover and this does not seem to be due to leptin deficiency.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare maternal and neonatal outcome of twin births according to mode of delivery and to isolate the factors predicting a successful vaginal delivery and those predicting a failed trial of labor (TOL) leading to an emergent cesarean section. We reviewed all twin deliveries during the years 1995 to 2004. Parameters studied include maternal age, parity, gestational age, maternal antepartum complications and postpartum complications, fetal presentations, birthweight, mode of delivery of each twin, Apgar scores and cord pH. During the study period there were 40,710 deliveries of which 804 (1.9%) were twin deliveries. Of the 804 twins, 398 (49.5%) had planned cesarean sections (PCS) and 406 (50.5%) entered a TOL. Maternal age and parity were similar among the groups. Neonatal outcomes and postpartum complications did not differ between the groups. Of 406 women who had a TOL, 84.9% eventually delivered both twins vaginally. A significantly higher percentage of antepartum complications were noted among those who failed the TOL compared to those with successful TOL (8.2% vs. 1.7%, p = .01). The number of neonates with pH of less than 7.0 did not differ between the groups although more neonates (2.5% vs. 0.4%, p = .05) among the failed TOL had an Apgar score of less than 7.0 at 5 minutes compared to successful TOL. Vaginal delivery of both twins after TOL occurred in 91% of vertex/vertex compared with 71.8% of vertex/nonvertex presenting twins (p < .01). Neonatal outcomes did not differ between both groups. Our results indicate that both vaginal and PCS are comparable options for vertex presenting first twin regardless of second twin presentation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to present curves of estimated placental growth in twins and to evaluate the relative contribution of gestational age, zygosity, chorionicity, fusion of the placentas, sex of the individual and of the twin pair, site of the umbilical cord insertion, birth order, maternal age, and parity. Perinatal data and placental data were obtained from 6315 live-born twin pairs from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. Of 4318 twin pairs, with no missing values, the placental weights of different gestational ages were analyzed using a nonlinear multivariate Gaussian regression. Two groups were distinguished: (1) twins with two separate placentas, and (2) twins with only one placental mass (one placenta in case of monochorionic twins or two fused placentas in case of dichorionic placentas). Overall, placental weight was influenced by gestational age, fusion of the placentas, and parity. In the case of one placental mass, monozygotic dichorionic twins had the lowest weights. If two separate placentas were present, birth order played a role in favor of the first-born twin. For parity and zygosity, the differences were most pronounced between 27 and 29 weeks, whereas the difference for birth order was most pronounced between 33 and 37 weeks. In conclusion, basic physiological characteristics, routinely examined at birth, influence placental weight. Taking these covariates into account allows a better evaluation of the placental weight given a gestational age, as an indicator of growth.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies are becoming common as a result of increased assisted reproduction. Studies have shown that the smaller twin of a pair is at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. Our aim was to determine if there is a relation between birth-weight discordancy and neonatal morbidity and mortality and to test the occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in discordant twins. For 5 years all twins admitted to our intensive care unit were included in the study. Discordance was calculated as the difference between twins' weights divided by the heavier weight. Diagnosis of RDS was made by typical clinical and radiographic methods. Multiple logistic regression was performed with gender, weight order and birth order as the independent variables and RDS as the dependent variable. Two hundred and sixty-six twin pairs with a mean gestation of 33 weeks and a mean birth-weight of 1890 g were evaluated. Multiple logistic regression revealed that being the heavier twin was a more important risk factor for RDS (odds ratio 4.5; 95% confidence interval 2.2-9.2) than being the male or second-born twin. Based on neonatal outcomes a birth-weight discordance equal or greater than 20% in twin pairs was accepted as the discordance criterion. Discordant and concordant groups were statistically different in neonatal mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, polycytemia and hypoglycemia. Our data demonstrated that being the heavier twin is a risk factor for RDS and a birth-weight difference of 20% or more in twin pairs should be accepted as discordance.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to examine causes of individual differences in height, weight and body mass index (BMI) in 5-year-old children registered with the Netherlands Twin Register. In addition, we examine whether the results of twin studies can be expanded to the singleton population by comparing the data from twins to Dutch reference growth data and by looking at the twins' target height, which was derived from parental height. For 2996 5-year-old twin pairs, information on height and weight and on parental height was available. Univariate and bivariate genetic analyses of height and weight and univariate analyses of BMI were conducted. In order to compare the twins to the singleton population, standard deviation scores (SDS) for height, BMI and target height were calculated based on Dutch reference growth charts for the general population from 1997. Genetic influences were an important source of variation in height, weight and BMI and the main source of covariation between height and weight. Additive genetic factors accounted for 69% and 66% of the individual differences in height in boys and girls, respectively. For weight, heritability estimates were 59% in boys and 78% in girls and for BMI 34% and 74%. The influence of common environment on height was 25% and 27%, on weight 24% and 10% and on BMI 44% and 12% in boys and girls. The bivariate model showed a large overlap between the genes influencing height and weight. Genes explain 78% (in boys) and 76% (in girls) of the covariance between weight and height. At the age of 5 years, female twins were as tall as singleton children, while male twins were shorter than singletons. For both boys and girls, however, mean height SDS was 0.6 standard deviation scores below the mean target height. All twins had lower BMI than singletons. Twins grow fairly well compared to singletons, but they grow below their target height. This may be due to the above average height of twin parents.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has provided strong support for the existence of a familial risk for suicide, and efforts have been made to separate genetic from enviromental risk factors. Twin studies have played a major role in the identification of genetic factors, and the results indicate that the concordance rate for suicide is higher in identical than in fraternal twins (Baldessarini & Hennen, 2004). Moreover, Segal and Roy (1995) reported a significantly higher frequency of nonfatal suicidal attempts by monozygotic (MZ) than by dyzygotic (DZ) twins whose co-twins had committed suicide. However, doubts remain as to whether the increased risk of suicide in MZ twins is a response to the intense grief over the loss of a close relative, or whether a common genotype is associated with suicidal behavior. Sudden loss, which may carry a stigma in the case of a suicide, has been linked to increased persistent emotional stress and physiological changes (Epstein, 1993; Martin & Dean, 1993). A number of researchers have reported greater suicidal ideation among bereaved MZ twins as compared to DZ twins, suggesting that a loss due to suicide may increase the risk of suicidal behavior in the surviving co-twin (Segal & Bouchard, 1993; Segal & Roy, 1995; Segal et al., 1995). The aim of the present article is to address the issue of the intense grief experienced by twins after the co-twin suicide.",

    "abstract": "Hostility has been shown to be a vulnerability marker for various health problems. The present study examined genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences in hostility in South Korean adolescent and young adult twins. Seven hundred and nineteen same- and opposite-sex twin pairs aged from 13 to 23 years completed a hostility scale. The scalar sex-limitation model was applied to the data. The best fitting model indicated that 34% of the total variation of hostility was attributable to genetic factors operating in a nonadditive manner. The remaining 66% of the variance was associated with nonshared environmental influences and measurement error. These findings were largely consistent with results from previous twin studies of personality based on Caucasian twins, rendering support for the pervasive influence of genetic nonadditivity on human personality traits and the generalization of the heritability of personality across human populations.",

    "abstract": "Incomplete intrinsic penetrance is the failure of some genetically susceptible individuals (e.g., monozygotic twins of those who have a trait) to exhibit that trait. For the first time, we examine penetrance of susceptibility genes for multiple MHC gene-determined traits in the same subjects. Serum levels of IgA, IgD, IgG3, but not IgG4, in 50 pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for type 1 diabetes (T1D) correlated more closely in the twins than in random paired controls. The frequencies of subjects deficient in IgA (6%), IgD (33%) and IgG4 (12%), but not in IgG3, were higher in the twins than in controls. We postulate that this was because the MHC haplotypes (and possible non-MHC genes) that predispose to T1D also carry susceptibility genes for certain immunoglobulin deficiencies. Immunoglobulin deficiencies were not associated with T1D. Pairwise concordance for the deficiencies in the twins was 50% for IgA, 57% for IgD and 50% for IgG4. There were no significant associations among the specific immunoglobulin deficiencies except that all IgA-deficient subjects had IgD deficiency. Thus, intrinsic penetrance is a random process independently affecting different MHC susceptibility genes. Because multiple different external triggers would be required to explain the results, differential environmental determinants appear unlikely.",

    "abstract": "While behavioral research shows working memory impairments in schizophrenics and their relatives, functional neuroimaging studies of patients and healthy controls show conflicting findings of hypo- and hyperactivation, possibly indicating different relationships between physiological activity and performance. In a between-subjects regression analysis of fMRI activation and performance, low performance was associated with relatively lower activation in patients than controls, while higher performance was associated with higher activation in patients than controls in DLPFC and parietal cortex, but not occipital cortex, with unaffected twins of schizophrenics being intermediate between the groups. Accordingly, this supports the idea that both hyper and hypoactivation may be possible along a continuum of behavioral performance in a way consistent with a neural inefficiency model. Further, this study offers preliminary evidence that the relationship between behavior and physiology in schizophrenia may be heritable.",

    "abstract": "This article estimates the number of monozygotic twins raised apart (MZA) potentially available to Cyril Burt in his twin studies. It concludes that between 77,000 and 88,000 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs would have been born and survived to the age of ten in the relevant period in England and Wales, and that between 750 and 1,750 surviving pairs are likely to have been separated during childhood. Burt's claim to have collected 53 MZA pairs is therefore not inherently implausible. However, when all the other constraints on Burt's studies are taken into account, his numbers are problematic. There are also serious difficulties with his claim to have studied 12 pairs born to middle-class parents. It is highly improbable that Burt could have located a majority of these cases through personal contacts as he claimed.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to establish a cohort of symptomatic twins with Scheuermann kyphosis to provide estimates of prevalence, concordance, odds ratio, and heritability. These estimates indicate to what extent genetic factors contribute to the etiology of this disease.\nThe Odense-based Danish Twin Registry is unique in that it contains data on all 73,000 twin pairs born in Denmark over the last 130 years. For the present study, all 46,418 twins born from 1931 through 1982 received a seventeen-page questionnaire, in which one question was \"Have you been diagnosed with Scheuermann disease by a doctor\"? The prevalence of self-reported Scheuermann disease was calculated, with the total number of answers used as the general population. Pairwise and probandwise concordance, odds ratio, tetrachoric correlations, and heritability were calculated.\nWe found that the overall prevalence of Scheuermann disease was 2.8%, with a prevalence of 2.1% among women and 3.6% among men (p < 0.0001). The pairwise concordance for monozygotic twins was 0.19 compared with 0.07 for dizygotic twins. The probandwise concordance was 0.31 for monozygotic twins and 0.13 for dizygotic twins. The odds ratios were 32.92 and 6.25 in the monozygotic and dizygotic twins, respectively. These differences were significant (p < 0.01). Heritability was 74%.\nIn a large cohort of twins that included almost 35,000 individuals, the self-reported overall prevalence of Scheuermann disease was 2.8% and the male-to-female ratio was close to 2:1. Because the pairwise and probandwise concordance and the odds ratio were two to three times higher in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins and the heritability was high, we concluded that there is a major genetic contribution to the etiology of Scheuermann disease.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that deficits in higher-order cognitive functions serve as intermediate phenotypic indicators of genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia. The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia postulates that insufficiency of dopamine transmission in the prefrontal cortex contributes to the cognitive deficits observed in patients with the disease, and there is robust empirical evidence for a central role of prefrontal cortex dopamine D(1) receptors in working memory functions.\nThe authors examined the genetic and nongenetic effects on D(1) receptor binding in schizophrenia by studying monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia as well as healthy comparison twins using positron emission tomography (PET) and the D(1) receptor antagonist ligand [(11)C]SCH 23390. Performance on neuropsychological tests sensitive to frontal lobe functioning was evaluated.\nHigh D(1) receptor density in the medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and heteromodal association cortex (angular gyrus) was associated with increasing genetic risk for schizophrenia (comparison twins < unaffected dizygotic co-twins < unaffected monozygotic co-twins). Medicated schizophrenia patients demonstrated a widespread reduction in D(1) receptor binding when compared with the unaffected co-twin, and higher doses of antipsychotics were associated with lower D(1) receptor binding in the frontotemporal regions.\nThis study demonstrated an association between genetic risk for schizophrenia and alterations in cortical D(1) receptor binding, an observation that has implications for future studies of the molecular genetics of schizophrenia. In addition, the data indicate a widespread reduction of D(1) receptor binding in medicated schizophrenia patients, supporting a link between antipsychotic drug action and dopamine D(1) receptor down-regulation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to examine the relationships between genetic susceptibility to obesity, physical activity (PA), dietary fibre, sugar and fat intakes and 4-year changes in body mass index (BMI) and attained waist circumference (WC) in a cohort of 287 monozygotic and 189 dizygotic young adult male twin pairs. Increased knowledge about interactions between genes and environment may provide insight into why some individuals are more prone to obesity than others.\nInformation about PA, BMI, dietary habits, WC and potential confounders was collected by questionnaire in 1998 and 2002. The cohort data were analysed by mixed linear models.\nTwins with low PA attained larger WC than twins with high PA (difference 2.5 cm; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 3.6). The twins with the lowest fibre intake were found to have attained the highest WC and to have increased most in BMI (difference between highest and lowest fibre intakes: 1.6 cm, 95% CI 0.4, 2.9 and 0.45 kg m(-2), 95% CI 0.15, 0.76, respectively). Furthermore, our results suggested the presence of interactions so that twins with genetic susceptibility to obesity were more prone to have larger WC if sedentary than twins without genetic susceptibility.\nPA and a diet rich in fibre may be protective against weight gain among younger adult men. An interaction between PA, genes and attained WC is a novel finding which needs confirmation by other studies.",

    "abstract": "Early analysis into the role of genetics on cardiovascular regulation has been accomplished by comparing blood pressure and heart rate in homozygous twins during unstressed, resting physiological conditions. However, many variables, including cognitive and environmental factors, contribute to the regulation of cardiovascular hemodynamics. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the hemodynamic response of identical twins to an orthostatic stress, ranging from supine rest to presyncope. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, middle cerebral artery blood velocity, an index of cerebrovascular resistance, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and end-tidal carbon dioxide were measured in 16 healthy monozygotic twin pairs. Five minutes of supine resting baseline data were collected, followed by 5 min of 60 degrees head-up tilt. After 5 min of head-up tilt, lower body negative pressure was applied in increments of 10 mmHg every 3 min until the onset of presyncope, at which time the subject was returned to the supine position for a 5-min recovery period. The data indicate that cardiovascular regulation under orthostatic stress demonstrates a significant degree of variance between identical twins, despite similar orthostatic tolerance. As the level of stress increases, so does the difference in the cardiovascular response within a twin pair. The elevated variance with increasing stress may be due to an increase in the role of environmental factors, as the influential role of genetics nears a functional limit. Therefore, although orthostatic tolerance times were very similar between identical twins, the mechanism involved in sustaining cardiovascular function during increasing stress was different.",

    "abstract": "Both environmental and genetic factors may contribute to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Nutrition in fetal life, an early environmental factor, seems to influence the development of chronic diseases later in life, such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, and non-insulin diabetes. This population based twin study evaluated the association between intrauterine growth, measured by weight and gestational age, and IBS. Structural equation analyses were conducted to analyse genetic and environmental sources of variation in liability to IBS.\nA postal questionnaire was sent to 12 700 Norwegian twins born between 1967 and 1979. The questionnaire included a checklist of 31 illnesses and symptoms, including IBS. The influence of birth weight on developing IBS was tested in four weight groups. Disease discordant monozygotic (MZ) pairs were analysed to test the association between intrauterine growth and IBS.\nConcordance for IBS was significantly greater (p = 0.011) in monozygotic (22.4%) than in dizygotic (9.1%) twins. The heritability of IBS was estimated to be 48.4% among females. Birth weight below 1500 g (adjusted odds ratio 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.1, 5.3)) contributed significantly to the development of IBS, which appeared 7.7 years earlier than in higher weight groups. In the MZ group with birth weights lower than 2500 g, twins with IBS were significantly lighter than twins without disease (190.6 g; p = 0.02).\nThe present study demonstrates that restricted fetal growth has a significant influence on the development of IBS later in life. Weight below 1500 g influences age at onset. Genetic contribution appears to be important for IBS among females.",

    "results": "Concordance for IBS was significantly greater (p = 0.011) in monozygotic (22.4%) than in dizygotic (9.1%) twins. The heritability of IBS was estimated to be 48.4% among females. Birth weight below 1500 g (adjusted odds ratio 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.1, 5.3)) contributed significantly to the development of IBS, which appeared 7.7 years earlier than in higher weight groups. In the MZ group with birth weights lower than 2500 g, twins with IBS were significantly lighter than twins without disease (190.6 g; p = 0.02).",

    "abstract": "Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) complicates approximately 15% of monochorionic, diamniotic twin pregnancies and if untreated carries a high perinatal loss rate of between 80% and 100%, depending on the stage. The underlying pathology in TTTS appears to be an imbalanced intertwin perfusion difference, secondary to functional unidirectional arteriovenous anastomoses within a monochorionic placenta. We report two cases of monochorionic twin pregnancy complicated by TTTS, in which the pregnancies were treated by serial aggressive amnioreduction. However, the recipient twin in each pregnancy developed 'ischemic damage' to a lower limb.",

    "abstract": "Increased perinatal mortality in monoamniotic twin pregnancies is attributed to cord accidents in utero and at delivery. We evaluated the following parameters in monoamniotic pregnancies: (1) the incidence of cord entanglement; (2) the effect of sulindac on amniotic fluid volume and stability of fetal lie; and (3) the perinatal outcome with our current management paradigm.\nThis is a retrospective review of monoamniotic pregnancies of >or=20 weeks' gestation managed with serial ultrasound surveillance, medical amnioreduction and elective Cesarean delivery at 32 weeks' gestation. Mean amniotic fluid index (AFI) and change in AFI in monoamniotic pregnancies managed with oral sulindac was compared with 40 gestation-matched monochorionic-diamniotic controls.\nAmong 44 monoamniotic pregnancies, 20 with two live structurally normal twins at 20 weeks' gestation satisfied the inclusion criteria. All fetuses survived to 28 days postnatally despite early prenatal cord entanglement in all but one case. Whereas AFI remained stable throughout gestation in the controls, the AFI fell in those patients on sulindac from a mean value of 21.0 cm (95% CI, 18.5-23.6 cm) at 20 weeks to a mean of 12.4 cm (95% CI, 10.1-14.6 cm) at 32 weeks (ANOVA P across gestation = 0.001) but mainly remained within normal limits. Fetal lie was stabilized in 11/20 cases in the monoamniotic group compared with 13/40 in the control group (P < 0.0001).\nCord entanglement appears unpreventable, as it typically occurs in early pregnancy. Sulindac therapy reduces AFI, leads to more stable fetal lie, and may prevent intrauterine death by diminishing the risk of constricting cords that are already entangled. Perinatal survival in monoamniotic pregnancies managed by a regime of sulindac from 20 weeks' gestation, close ultrasound surveillance and elective abdominal delivery at 32 weeks' gestation seems empirically higher than that in the literature.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to estimate the rate of fetal loss in dichorionic (DC) and monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies stratified according to zygosity and method of conception.\nIn a prospective multicenter observational study women with a twin pregnancy had an ultrasound scan before 14 + 6 weeks' gestation in order to determine chorionicity. The fetal loss rate, the perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality rates and the frequency of very preterm labor were estimated for the different types of twin.\nAmong the 495 pregnancies (421 DC and 74 MC) 229 (46%) were conceived naturally and 266 (54%) by assisted reproduction (AR). Outcome data for 945 liveborn babies were obtained. The spontaneous miscarriage rate before 24 weeks' gestation was 10.9% (7/64) among naturally conceived MC compared to 3.0% (5/165) for naturally conceived DC twins (P < 0.05). For twins conceived by AR the corresponding figures were 0% (0/10) and 0.4% (1/256). The odds ratio (OR) for very preterm birth-before 28 weeks' gestation-was 4.2 for MC twins compared to DC twins. The relative risk of fetal loss or death among DC twins was 20% of the risk for MC twins.\nThe risk of fetal loss, very preterm delivery and neonatal/infant death is significantly higher among twins with MC compared to DC placentation. Twins conceived by AR have a much lower risk of MC placentation. The risk of losing one or both twins seems higher among naturally conceived twins compared to twins conceived by AR, despite the fact that the maternal age was higher among the mothers of the AR twins.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports of genetic influences on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms have suggested moderate heritability. Family history studies of co-morbidity have found familial aggregation with tics, especially for early-onset OCD, and familial aggregation with anxiety disorders.\nHeritability of OCD and familial aggregation of OCD, tics and anxiety disorders were investigated in a community sample of 6-year-old twins using a two-phase design in which 4662 twin pairs were sampled and 854 pairs were assessed in the second phase by maternal-informant diagnostic interview using DSM-IV criteria.\nIn the multivariate model combined additive genetic and common environmental effects were estimated as 47% for sub-threshold OCD, and the model was unable to distinguish these sources of familial aggregation. There were strong familial aggregations between sub-threshold OCD and tics and between sub-threshold OCD and other anxiety disorders (80% and 97% respectively), although again specific sources could not be distinguished.\nThe findings are consistent with the hypothesis of a tic-related early-onset OCD phenotype, but also with the hypothesis of an anxiety-related early-onset OCD phenotype.",

Results from twin studies implicate the role of genetics in the etiology of both ND and AD with substantial, yet incomplete, overlap. To test for specificity of transmission of AD and ND in an offspring of twins sample we analyzed data from a study of adolescent and adult offspring of twin fathers ascertained from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. This sample consists of 1213 twin fathers, 862 biologic or rearing mothers, and 1270 offspring. Offspring were allocated to one of four risk groups for AD based on twin fathers' zygosity and father's and cotwins AD history. Offspring DSM-IV AD and ND were measured by structured diagnostic interview. Paternal AD and ND were significantly associated with offspring AD and ND, respectively. Bivariate probit regression results suggest specificity for transmission of AD and ND. This remained constant after controlling for offspring demographics and psychopathology and maternal AD and ND. Despite the substantial genetic overlap between the two disorders, there is evidence for genetic effects specific for AD and ND.",

    "abstract": "The best practice for the delivery of a term breech in singleton and twin pregnancies is still controversial. We sought the opinions of obstetricians working in Ireland. A questionnaire was used to address the management of the obstetrician's \"own hypothetical pregnancy\" in three different scenarios. We also inquired about factors which might influence the decision on mode of delivery. The response rate was 104/174 (60%). In the scenario of a singleton fetus presenting by the breech in a nulliparous woman, 15/84 (18%) of obstetricians would chose a spontaneous vaginal delivery compared to 40/80 (50%) for a multiparous woman (p < 0.01). In the scenario of a second twin in breech presentation (nulliparous and multiparous), 75/93 (81%) would choose a spontaneous vaginal delivery. When asked about a singleton cephalic presentation, 85/91 (93%) would choose a spontaneous vaginal delivery. These decisions were influenced by concerns about perinatal morbidity [91/100 (91%)], published evidence [73/98 (75%)], the delivery doctor's inexperience [56/94 (60%)], but not by gender. Our study indicates that obstetricians in Ireland consider that there is a role for vaginal breech delivery in selected scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis. Skin abnormalities result from an inability to repair UV-damaged DNA. Clinically, XP presents with early onset cutaneous changes (severe photosensitivity, actinic keratoses, and telangiectasias) and an increase of developing cutaneous malignancies beginning in early childhood, but lentigo maligna and melanomas are relatively rare. Here we report on homozygote twins in whom there was no positive family history. They showed subnormal physical growth. On ophthalmological examination, both had photophobia and decreased visual acuity. Since birth, several excisions had been performed for skin neoplasms. In one of them a pigmented patch developed over the frontal area which proved to be lentigo maligna and she was referred to a dermato-oncology center. They have been given isotretinoin and physical sunscreen since then. The follow-up period was extended to 2 years and no serious complications occurred from the above treatment. This is an interesting report about XP in twins with the presentation of the rare neoplasm lentigo maligna.",

    "abstract": "The expansion of unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat polymorphisms of a number of genes causes several neurodegenerative disorders with decreased cognitive function, the severity of the disorder being related to allele length at the triplet repeat locus. While the effects of repeat length have been well studied in clinical samples, there has been little investigation of the effects of triplet repeat variation in the normal range for these genes. We have, therefore, examined linkage and association for three CAG triplet repeat markers (Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1, SCA1; Machado-Joseph Disease, MJD; Dentatorubro-pallidoluysian Atrophy, DRPLA) to assess their contribution to variation in cognitive ability (IQ, reading ability, processing speed) in a normal, unselected sample of adolescent twins (248 dizygotic (DZ) sibling pairs, aged 16 years). Association tests, performed in Mx and QTDT, showed a consistent positive association of SCA1 with Arithmetic (P = 0.04). While association was supported between SCA1 and Cambridge reading scores and between DRPLA and inspection time, results were inconsistent across software packages. Given the number of statistical tests performed, it is unlikely that trinucleotide repeat variation in the normal range for these genes influences variation in normal cognition.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are very rare congenital malformation. The aim of this study was to summarize our experiences of surgical separation on seven sets of conjoined twins, and improve the treatment of conjoined twins in the future. A retrospective review of surgical separation included data of prenatal diagnosis, associated malformation, timing of separation, intra- and postoperative management, and follow-up of six sets of conjoined twins at Shanghai Xin-Hua Hospital from 1980 to 2005 and one set at Shanghai Children's Hospital in 2002. Surgical separation was performed on seven sets of conjoined twins; six sets of thoracopagus-omphalapagus (including four sets of xipho-omphalopagus) and one set of ischiopagus. All sets presented varying degrees of severity of congenital cardiac malformations. Four sets were diagnosed prenatally by ultrasonography. Two sets of conjoined twins (case 2 and case 3) required emergent separation within 7 days after birth; both members of case 2 died within 2 days post operation, one member of case 3 died during operation while the other member survived. Five sets had scheduled separation undertaken more than 30 days after birth. One member of a set (case 6B) died 13 days after operation due to severe congenital cardiovascular anomalies. All other members of conjoined twins survived. Case 6A had a severe defect of the anterior thoracic cage and prosthesis of titanium alloy scaffold filled with silicone rubber was used to repair the defects successfully. Following up from 1980 to 2005, one member of a set (case 1A) died 4 years after operation due to pneumonia. Contact was lost to the surviving member of case 3 (ischiopagus). Other survivors of the separations had normal development. (1) Timing of operation and separation plan should be given according to the circumstances and the nature of the organ shared in each individual set of twins. (2) Prosthesis of titanium alloy scaffolds filled with silicone rubber may become one of viable methods for repairing severe defects of the thoracic cage.",

    "abstract": "Genes from the ovarian bone morphogenetic signaling pathway (GDF9 and BMP15) are critical for normal human fertility. We previously identified a deletion mutation in GDF9 in sisters with spontaneous dizygotic (DZ) twins, but the prevalence of rare GDF9 variants in twinning families is unknown.\nThe objective was to evaluate the frequency of rare variants in GDF9 in families with a history of DZ twinning.\nWe recruited 3450 individuals from 915 DZ twinning families (1693 mothers of twins) and 1512 controls of Caucasian origin. One mother of DZ twins was selected from 279 of the 915 families, and a DNA sample was screened for rare variants in GDF9 using denaturant HPLC. Variants were confirmed by DNA sequencing and genotyped in the entire sample by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.\nWe found two novel insertion/deletions (c.392-393insT, c.1268-1269delAA) and four missense alterations in the GDF9 sequence in mothers of twins. Two of the missense variants (c.307C > T, p.Pro103Ser and c.362C > T, p.Thr121Leu) were located in the pro-region of GDF9 and two (c.1121C > T, p.Pro374Leu and c.1360C > T, p.Arg454Cys) in the mature protein region. For each variant, the frequencies were higher in cases compared with controls. The proportion of mothers of DZ twins carrying any variant (4.12%) was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than the proportion of carriers in controls (2.29%).\nWe describe new variants in the GDF9 gene that are significantly more common in mothers of DZ twins than controls, suggesting that rare GDF9 variants contribute to the likelihood of DZ twinning.",

To better understand these covarying difficulties, genetic and environmental influences were estimated by using a twin design.\nThree hundred 8-year-old twin pairs reported on their anxiety and depression by completing the Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders and the Children's Depression Inventory. Parents reported on their children's sleep problems by completing the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire.\nChildren reported by their parents to have different types of sleep problems self-reported more depression symptoms than those without. The correlation between total sleep-problem score and depression was moderate. That between sleep problems and anxiety was smaller and was not examined further. The association between sleep problems and depression was mainly explained by genes, and there was substantial overlap between the genes influencing sleep problems and those influencing depression. There was smaller influence from environmental factors making family members alike, and environmental factors making family members different decreased the association between sleep problems and depression.\nA range of sleep difficulties are associated with depression in school-aged children, and the overall association between the 2 difficulties may be largely influenced by genes.",

The correlation between total sleep-problem score and depression was moderate. That between sleep problems and anxiety was smaller and was not examined further. The association between sleep problems and depression was mainly explained by genes, and there was substantial overlap between the genes influencing sleep problems and those influencing depression. There was smaller influence from environmental factors making family members alike, and environmental factors making family members different decreased the association between sleep problems and depression.",

    "abstract": "A large number of articles have been published since neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) started in the 1970s. Surprisingly, little information on false negative results in these screenings has been reported.\nThyroid-stimulating hormone (THS) levels were determined in 360,651 newborn infants in Malaga until March 2005. One hundred and fifty-six CH cases were detected, of which 86 % were permanent and 14 % were transient. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed a group of 13 CH dizygotic twins in which only one of the twins had CH.\nThe first two patients were diagnosed late and data on whether they were included in neonatal screening were lacking. In seven of the 13 patients, TSH values were initially normal: five patients were diagnosed by a second test performed 14 days after birth and were treated before they were 1 month old, and two were diagnosed and treated late because a second test was not performed. In the remaining four patients, TSH values were initially elevated but were lower than confirmation test values.\nIt is now widely accepted that thyroid function could be compensated between two dizygotic twins if only one of the twins has CH, leading to a false negative result. The results of the present study indicate the need to repeat the test for CH 14 days after birth in all dizygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the relationship between IGF-I-IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-1 and leptin levels with type 1 collagen markers of bone turnover in dichorionic twins with or without discordant birth weight of 20% or greater.\nMaternal and cord bloods were collected from gestational age-matched dichorionic twins with (n = 16) or without (n = 16) discordant birth weight. The samples were assayed for cross-linked carboxyl terminal telopeptide (ICTP, a marker of bone resorption) and propeptide (PICP, a marker of bone formation) of type I collagen, leptin, IGF-I, and IGFBP-1 by RIA.\nThe intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) twins of the discordant group had higher fetal ICTP (P < 0.001) and IGFBP-1 (P < 0.001) levels, whereas PICP (P < 0.001), IGF-I (P < 0.001), and leptin (P < 0.001) were lower than the cotwins with normal weight (AGA). In contrast, concentrations of IGF-I, IGFBP-1, ICTP, PICP, and leptin were comparable between concordant twin pairs. Leptin levels were positively correlated with PICP (r = 0.61; P < 0.001) and negatively with ICTP (r = -0.57; P < 0.001) in concordant and AGA twins but not in IUGR twins. In IUGR twins, IGF-I had positive association with PICP (r = 0.76; P < 0.001) and negative association with ICTP (r= -0.76; P < 0.001), whereas IGFBP-1 was negatively correlated with PICP levels (r = -0.65; P < 0.01). No such association was found in concordant and AGA twins.\nThese data suggest that IUGR twins had high bone turnover, which is independent of maternal factors and perhaps may be due to altered IGF axis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess treatment responses to dental flossing in twins.\nThe study was a two-treatment, examiner-blind, randomized parallel group, controlled study. Fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of 1) tongue brushing and toothbrushing (TB) and 2) TB + flossing (TB + Fl). Clinical endpoints were gingival bleeding (papillary bleeding score [PBS]) and oral malodor (levels of volatile sulfur compounds [VSC]). Analysis of variance and covariance methodologies were employed to analyze the data.\nBaseline average PBS values were 1.352 and 1.345 for the TB + Fl and TB groups, respectively (P=0.937). After 2 weeks of treatment, the TB + Fl group had a statistically significant decrease in PBS values of 0.558 (41.5% versus baseline), whereas the TB group showed no improvement from baseline. The change from baseline for the TB + Fl group was superior to that for the TB group (P<0.001). Similar findings were observed for the number of baseline papillary bleeding sites. Baseline average intraoral halimeter values were 45.91 and 41.75 for the TB+Fl and TB groups, respectively (P=0.504). Both treatment regimens demonstrated highly statistically significant reductions in intraoral halimeter values versus baseline (all P<0.001) and the difference between treatment groups was not statistically significant (P=0.339). Similar findings were found for expired air.\nIn a well-matched twin cohort, tongue and toothbrushing plus flossing significantly decreased gingival bleeding after 2 weeks.",

    "abstract": "Many studies of quantitative and disease traits in human genetics rely upon self-reported measures. Such measures are based on questionnaires or interviews and are often cheaper and more readily available than alternatives. However, the precision and potential bias cannot usually be assessed. Here we report a detailed quantitative genetic analysis of stature. We characterise the degree of measurement error by utilising a large sample of Australian twin pairs (857 MZ, 815 DZ) with both clinical and self-reported measures of height. Self-report height measurements are shown to be more variable than clinical measures. This has led to lowered estimates of heritability in many previous studies of stature. In our twin sample the heritability estimate for clinical height exceeded 90%. Repeated measures analysis shows that 2-3 times as many self-report measures are required to recover heritability estimates similar to those obtained from clinical measures. Bivariate genetic repeated measures analysis of self-report and clinical height measures showed an additive genetic correlation >0.98. We show that the accuracy of self-report height is upwardly biased in older individuals and in individuals of short stature. By comparing clinical and self-report measures we also showed that there was a genetic component to females systematically reporting their height incorrectly; this phenomenon appeared to not be present in males. The results from the measurement error analysis were subsequently used to assess the effects of error on the power to detect linkage in a genome scan. Moderate reduction in error (through the use of accurate clinical or multiple self-report measures) increased the effective sample size by 22%; elimination of measurement error led to increases in effective sample size of 41%.",

    "abstract": "The objective was to determine whether the pattern of environmental and genetic influences on deviant personality scores differs from that observed for the normative range of personality, comparing results in adolescent and adult female twins.\nA sample of 2,796 female adolescent twins ascertained from birth records provided Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire data. The average age of the sample was 17.0 years (S.D. 2.3). Genetic analyses of continuous and extreme personality scores were conducted. Results were compared for 3,178 adult female twins.\nGenetic analysis of continuous traits in adolescent female twins were similar to findings in adult female twins, with genetic influences accounting for between 37% and 44% of the variance in Extraversion (Ex), Neuroticism (N), and Social Non-Conformity (SNC), with significant evidence of shared environmental influences (19%) found only for SNC in the adult female twins. Analyses of extreme personality characteristics, defined categorically, in the adolescent data and replicated in the adult female data, yielded estimates for high N and high SNC that deviated substantially (p < .05) from those obtained in the continuous trait analyses, and provided suggestive evidence that shared family environment may play a more important role in determining personality deviance than has been previously found when personality is viewed continuously. However, multiple-threshold models that assumed the same genetic and environmental determinants of both normative range variation and extreme scores gave acceptable fits for each personality dimension.\nThe hypothesis of differences in genetic or environmental factors responsible for N and SNC among female twins with scores in the extreme versus normative ranges was partially supported, but not for Ex.",

    "results": "Genetic analysis of continuous traits in adolescent female twins were similar to findings in adult female twins, with genetic influences accounting for between 37% and 44% of the variance in Extraversion (Ex), Neuroticism (N), and Social Non-Conformity (SNC), with significant evidence of shared environmental influences (19%) found only for SNC in the adult female twins. Analyses of extreme personality characteristics, defined categorically, in the adolescent data and replicated in the adult female data, yielded estimates for high N and high SNC that deviated substantially (p < .05) from those obtained in the continuous trait analyses, and provided suggestive evidence that shared family environment may play a more important role in determining personality deviance than has been previously found when personality is viewed continuously. However, multiple-threshold models that assumed the same genetic and environmental determinants of both normative range variation and extreme scores gave acceptable fits for each personality dimension.",

    "abstract": "An algorithm is presented to derive the twin laws in non-merohedric twins through the systematic search for quasi-perpendicular lattice planes/directions. The twin lattice, i.e. the sublattice common to the whole crystalline edifice built by the twinned individuals, is based on a supercell of the individual defined by a pair of quasi-perpendicular lattice elements (hkl)/[uvw]. Starting from a (real or supposed) twin element, (hkl) or [uvw], the set of quasi-perpendicular lattice elements with user-defined limits on the twin index and obliquity is explored. The degree of lattice quasi-restoration is commonly measured by the classical twin index but in some cases, especially for large supercells, this index represents only a first approximation of the degree of lattice quasi-restoration, because more than one pair (hkl)/[uvw] may exist, and more than one concurrent sublattices of nodes, based on the same twin element, may be quasi-restored, although within different obliquities. These twins, whose existence has been recently recognized, are termed hybrid twins. In hybrid twins, the degree of lattice quasi-restoration is measured by the effective twin index n(E), a generalization of the classical twin index: in the limiting case of only one (quasi-)restored sublattice, the effective twin index and the classical twin index coincide. A number of examples previously reported simply as 'non-Friedelian' twins (with a twin index higher than the empirical limit of 6 established by Friedel) are analysed and reinterpreted as hybrid twins. A Fortran program is made available, which derives the possible twin laws according to this algorithm and analyses the pseudosymmetry of the concurrent sublattices defined by each pair (hkl)/[uvw]. The occurrence of hybrid concurrent components in twinning does not affect the normal procedures of dealing with diffraction patterns of twinned crystals.",

    "abstract": "It remains controversial whether there is a significant genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of idiopathic giant retinal tears or retinal dialysis. In contrast, the underlying molecular genetic basis of several inherited vitreoretinal dystrophies is now well established, with also an increasing recognition of genetic factors in the development of myopia. We describe asymptomatic female monozygotic twins who were identified as having identical retinal holes. These cases represent the first evidence to our knowledge of a potential role of inherited factors in the causation of idiopathic peripheral retinal holes. This observation raises the need to examine the twin of any patient presenting with a retinal break(s).",

The fetuses were of the thoraco-omphalopagus type and were sharing the liver, as confirmed by color Doppler. There was a reversed flow in the single ductus venosus of the twins. Umbilical arterial and venous blood flow waveform did not show any abnormality for this gestational age. This case demonstrated the possibility of making an accurate diagnosis of conjoined twins in the first trimester by transvaginal two-dimensional ultrasound and color Doppler examination. Although conjoined twins were described at first trimester before, fetoplacental Doppler waveform findings at this gestational age have been described very rarely. This case demonstrated the possibility of making an accurate diagnosis of conjoined twins and delineating the extent of organ sharing in the first trimester, and early diagnosis can help the parents with the option for pregnancy termination. The importance of expert early vaginal sonography and color Doppler findings is emphasized.",

Questionnaires were mailed to Finnish twins born 1975-1979 at ages 16, 17, 18 1/2 and, on average, 25 years of age (N=2465 complete twin pairs). The data were analyzed using quantitative genetic methods for twin data by the Mx statistical package. Heritability of self-rated health was greatest at age 16 (63%, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 56-67%, men and women together) and declined steadily to age 25 (33%, 95% CI 25-41%). The residual variation was due to unshared environments. Health ratings at different ages were modestly correlated (r=0.33-0.61). These correlations were mainly due to genetic factors, but unshared environment also contributed to them. An important challenge for further research is to identify environmental influences contributing to self-rated health independently of, or in interaction with, genetic factors.",

Therefore, we performed an open prospective study in 108 monozygotic (MZ) and 60 same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs to analyse the genetic and environmental contributions to plasma CRP and IL-6 levels. Heritability of IL-6 was 0.61, indicating that plasma IL-6 levels are to a major part influenced by genetic determinants; however, for CRP, heritability was only 0.22, pointing to a moderate genetic influence. Plasma CRP levels were strongly influenced by female gender, older age and especially the body mass index. Our data underline the central role of IL-6 in low-grade inflammation contributing to atherosclerosis and CVD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to estimate the heritability of variation in testosterone levels in 12-year-old children, and to explore the overlap in genetic and environmental influences on circulating testosterone levels and androgen-dependent pubertal development. Midday salivary testosterone samples were collected on 2 consecutive days in a sample of 183 unselected twin pairs. Androgen-induced pubertal development was assessed using self-report Tanner scales of pubic hair development (boys and girls) and genital development (boys). A significant contribution of genetic effects to the variance in testosterone levels was found. Heritability was approximately 50% in both boys and girls. The remaining proportion of the variance in testosterone levels could be explained by nonshared environmental influences. The relatively high correlation between testosterone levels of opposite-sex dizygotic twins suggests that sex differences in genes influencing variation in testosterone levels have not yet developed in pre- and early puberty. Variance in pubertal development was explained by a large genetic component, moderate shared environmental influences, and a small nonshared environmental effect. Testosterone levels correlated moderately (r = .31) with pubertal development; the covariance between testosterone levels and pubertal development was entirely accounted for by genetic influences.",

    "abstract": "Twin designs, comparing correlations in monozygotic (MZ) versus dizygotic (DZ) twins, have an extensive history. One major confounder in such studies is that MZ twins may share postnatal environmental influences more so than do DZ twins. To avoid such confounding, twins separated at or soon after birth have been studied, but their scarcity often makes this approach impractical. Another method has been to measure the degree of contact twins have maintained over time, and adjust the observed correlations. Here, we remove confounding by utilizing the discrepancy between biological and self-perceived zygosity to separate environmental from genetic sources of twin similarity. We analyzed dietary patterns and physiologic traits in 350 female twin pairs of the 1988 Kaiser Permanente Twin Registry. Among twin pairs, 175 were MZ by self-report and genetic testing (MZC), 136 were DZ by self-report and genetic testing (DZC), 30 were MZ by genetic testing but not by self-report (MZW), and 9 were DZ by genetic testing but not by self-report (DZW) but were excluded due to small sample size. For healthy food patterns, MZC and MZW intraclass correlations were similar and greater than for DZC, yielding positive and significant heritability estimates. For unhealthy food patterns, the MZC, MZW and DZC correlations were similar with no significant heritability. For physiologic traits, MZC and MZW correlations were similar and higher than those for DZC, indicating significant heritability, except for insulin for which MZW and DZC were similar and which showed modest heritability. Twins of mistaken zygosity (TOMZ) provides a useful approach to robust determination of heritability.",

    "abstract": "Few long-term studies have yet described neuropsychological outcome in preterm twins. Our aim was to assess, by long-term evaluation, neuropsychological outcome in preterm twins in order to define a correct follow-up program. Our study was a cohort one, with an index and a comparison group. Neonatal medical records of all preterm newborns admitted to our centre between 1991 and 1997 were reviewed and selected patients were recalled. The sample population included two matched groups of children aged 6-12 years, 86 twins and 86 singletons, submitted to paediatric, neurological, psychological, and ophthalmological examinations. Inclusion criteria were twin pregnancy and gestational age 27-36 weeks for index group; same gestational age, but single pregnancy, for the comparison group. All children underwent paediatric and neuropsychiatric examinations, cognitive assessment, and psychological evaluation by standardized tests for screening of learning specific disorders and language difficulties, and finally, ophthalmological examination. In order to study their role in predicting neuropsychological outcome, we examined some perinatal prognostic factors by statistical analysis. Unfavourable neuropsychological outcome was observed in 55/172 (32%) children, with different prevalence in the two groups, 42/172 (24%) in twins and 13/172 (8%) in singletons. Statistical analysis performed for examined prognostic factors showed significant differences in neuropsychological outcome with regard only to gestational age < 32 weeks, low birth weight, intraventricular haemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia. The incidence of neuropsychological diseases in the two groups showed significant difference about language and learning difficulties. Our data suggest that preterm twins represent a particular high-risk category of premature babies, mostly regarding the risk of so-called \"minimal brain dysfunction\", so a careful follow-up is recommended.",

    "abstract": "A biological abnormality found to be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be, among other things, a pretrauma vulnerability factor, that is, it may have been present prior to the event's occurrence and increased the individual's likelihood of developing PTSD upon traumatic exposure. Alternately, it may be an acquired PTSD sign, that is, it may have developed after the traumatic exposure, along with the PTSD. We have studied pairs of Vietnam combat veterans and their noncombat-exposed, identical twins in an effort to resolve these competing origins. Combat veterans were diagnosed as current PTSD or non-PTSD (i.e., never had). Average heart rate responses (HRRs) to a series of sudden, loud-tone presentations were larger in Vietnam combat veteran twins with PTSD, but these larger responses were not shared by their noncombat-exposed cotwins, whose responses were similar to those of the non-PTSD combat veterans and their noncombat-exposed cotwins. These results suggest that larger HRRs to sudden, loud tones represent an acquired sign of PTSD. In contrast, increased neurological soft signs (NSSs), diminished hippocampal volume, and presence of abnormal cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) were found in Vietnam combat veteran twins with PTSD and their \"high-risk,\" unexposed cotwins compared to Vietnam combat veteran twins without PTSD and their \"low-risk,\" unexposed cotwins. These results support the conclusion that the latter abnormalities represent antecedent, familial vulnerability factors for developing chronic PTSD upon exposure to a traumatic event.",

    "abstract": "To describe the occurrence and heritability of astigmatism in a population-based sample of Norwegian twins.\nSelf-reported history of astigmatism based on questionnaire responses was used to estimate the prevalence and incidence rates of astigmatism from birth through 31 years in 8,045 twins. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-binomial regression were used to study the conditional and relative risk of astigmatism in twin pairs by sex and zygosity. Tetrachoric correlations and structural equation models were applied to estimate the genetic and environmental sources of variations in liability for astigmatism.\nAltogether 21.1% of males and 29.3% of females (p < 0.001) reported a positive history of astigmatism. Estimated incidence rates peaked in both sexes in the group aged 16-19 years and then decreased. Both conditional and relative risks of developing astigmatism were considerably higher in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins if a cotwin reported a positive history of astigmatism. The best-fitting biometrical model suggested that additive genetic, dominant genetic, and individual environmental effects explained 9% (95% CI: 0-40), 54% (95% CI: 20-69), and 38% (95% CI: 31-45) of the variation in the liability to astigmatism, respectively. No differences in heritability of astigmatism between the genders were found.\nThe prevalence of self-reported astigmatism in twins is comparable with previous findings from Norway. Our results suggest considerable genetic contribution to the development of astigmatism in young adult Norwegian twins mainly due to dominant genetic effects, which are similar in both males and females.",

    "abstract": "Drawing upon qualitative interviews with monozygotic (identical) twins sharing 100% of their genes, and with dizygotic (fraternal) twins and singletons as control groups, this paper explores what it means to be genetically identical. (The twins interviewed were from the TwinsUK register in London.) In the context of the ongoing debate on human reproductive cloning, it examines questions such as: To what extent do identical twins perceive their emotional and physical bond to be a result of their genetic makeup? What would they think if they had been deliberately created genetically identical? How would they feel about being genetically identical to a person who was born a few years earlier or later? First, our respondents ascribed no great significance to the role of genes in their understanding of what it means to be identical twins. Second, the opinion that human reproductive cloning would \"interfere with nature\", or \"contradict God's will\", was expressed by our respondents exclusively on the abstract level. The more our respondents were able to relate a particular invented cloning scenario to their own life-worlds, the lower the prevalence of the argument. Third, for all three groups of respondents, the scenario of having been born in one of the other groups was perceived as strange. Fourth, the aspect that our respondents disliked about cloning scenarios was the potential motives of the cloners. Without equating monozygotic twins directly with \"clones\", these results from \"naturally\" genetically identical individuals add a new dimension to what a future cloning situation could entail: The cloned person might possibly (a) perceive a close physical and emotional connection to the progenitor as a blessing; (b) suffer from preconceptions of people who regard physical likeness as a sign of incomplete individuality; and (c) perceive the idea of not having been born a clone of a particular person as unpleasant.",

    "abstract": "HbA(1c) (A1C) is substantially determined by genetic factors not shared in common with glucose. Fractions of the variance in A1C, the glycation gap (GG; previously called the glycosylation gap) and the hemoglobin glycosylation index, correlate with diabetes complications. We therefore tested whether GG (measured A1C - A1C predicted from glycated serum proteins [GSPs]) was genetically determined and whether it accounted for the heritability of A1C.\nWe conducted a classic twin study on A1C and GSP collected in 40 and 46 pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic healthy female twins, respectively. The predicted A1C was based on the regression line between A1C and GSP in a separate population spanning the pathophysiologic range.\nGG was more strongly correlated between monozygotic (r = 0.65) than dizygotic (r = 0.48) twins, adjusted for age and BMI. The best-fitting quantitative genetic model adjusted for age and BMI showed that 69% of population variance in GG is heritable, while the remaining 31% is due to unique environmental influences. In contrast, GSP was similarly correlated between monozygotic (r = 0.55) and dizygotic (r = 0.49) twins, hence not genetically determined. GG was strongly correlated to A1C (r = 0.48), attributable mostly to genetic factors. About one-third of the heritability of A1C is shared with GG; the remainder is specific to A1C.\nHeritability of the GG accounts for about one-third of the heritability of A1C. By implication, there are gene(s) that preferentially affect erythrocyte lifespan or glucose and/or nonenzymatic glycation or deglycation in the intracellular, rather than extracellular, compartment.",

This twin pair were full term and had a similar birth weight: 2.27 kg and 1.81 kg in twin 1 and twin 2, respectively. There was no report of any other childhood medical conditions in either twin. Both twins had an equal amount of restriction in right and left abduction. Narrowing of the palpebral fissures and globe retraction in right and left adduction was also observed in both twins. To our knowledge this is the first case to report concordant bilateral DRS (type 1) in female MZ twins. The concordance for the presence of DRS and associated clinical signs observed in this MZ twin pair supports a genetic origin to DRS.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychological deficits have been reported among trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is often assumed that these cognitive difficulties are toxic consequences of trauma exposure. Alternatively, they may reflect preexisting characteristics that contribute to the likelihood of developing PTSD. To address this possibility, the authors evaluated cognitive performance in monozygotic twin pairs who were discordant for combat exposure. Pairs were grouped according to whether the combat-exposed brother developed PTSD. The combat-unexposed cotwins of combat veterans with PTSD largely displayed the same performance as their brothers, which was significantly lower than that of non-PTSD combat veterans and their brothers. The results support the notion that specific domains of cognitive function may serve as premorbid risk or protective factors in PTSD.",

    "abstract": "To help develop an evidence-based approach to the best management of twin pregnancies discordant for anencephaly.\nWe retrospectively examined the management and outcome of 18 pregnancies discordant for anencephaly diagnosed at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks of gestation in our center. We combined these data with those from other publications. In total, there were 44 dichorionic pregnancies that were managed expectantly (n = 35) or by selective feticide (n = 9) and 19 monochorionic pregnancies that were managed expectantly. We also reviewed the literature to ascertain the outcome of monochorionic twin pregnancies undergoing cord occlusion.\nIn the 35 dichorionic pregnancies that were managed expectantly, 20 (57.1%) developed polyhydramnios at 25-31 weeks; 13 were managed expectantly, five had amniodrainage and two had selective feticide. In 34 of the 35 cases the non-anencephalic twin was liveborn at a median gestation of 36 (range, 28-39) weeks and in six (17.6%) of these it was born before 33 weeks. In the dichorionic pregnancies that had selective feticide, there was one miscarriage and eight (88.9%) live births at a median gestation of 37 (range, 30-40) weeks and in one (12.5%) of these it was born before 33 weeks. In the monochorionic pregnancies, four (21.1%) anencephalic fetuses died at 20-32 weeks and in three of these the normal co-twin also died. In the 16 (84.2%) cases resulting in the live birth of the normal twin, delivery occurred at a median gestation of 33 (range, 27-39) weeks and in six (37.5%) of these it was before 33 weeks. Ultrasound-guided bipolar cord coagulation in 92 pregnancies, mostly complicated by twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence or severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, was associated with a survival rate of 77.2% and early preterm delivery rate of 31.0%.\nDichorionic twins discordant for anencephaly are best managed with serial ultrasound examinations for early diagnosis of polyhydramnios, which can then be treated either by amniodrainage or selective feticide. In monochorionic twins it is uncertain whether the best management is expectant or by cord occlusion.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether acquired obesity or accompanying metabolic changes such as adiponectin deficiency, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, or visceral fat are associated, independent of genetic influences, with endothelial dysfunction by studying young adult monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for obesity.\nNine obesity-discordant (intra-pair difference in BMI, 3.8 to 10.1 kg/m(2)) and nine concordant (0 to 2.3 kg/m(2)) 24- to 27-year-old MZ twin pairs were identified from a population-based FinnTwin16-sample. Endothelial function was measured by blood flow responses to intrabrachial infusions of an endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and an endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside) vasodilator. Whole body insulin sensitivity was measured using the euglycemic insulin clamp technique, and forearm and body composition were measured with magnetic resonance imaging and DXA. In addition, serum levels of adiponectin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and lipids were determined.\nThe heavier co-twins of the discordant pairs had significantly lower whole body insulin sensitivity than the leaner co-twins. Blood flows/muscle volume during infusions of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were not altered by obesity. However, intra-pair differences in serum adiponectin, intra-abdominal fat, and C-reactive protein were significantly correlated with those in endothelial function. Only the relationship between intra-pair differences in adiponectin and endothelial function persisted in multiple linear regression analysis. Obesity-concordant co-twins had comparable insulin sensitivity and endothelial function.\nIn young adult MZ twins discordant for obesity, acquired adiponectin deficiency rather than obesity per se is an independent correlate of endothelial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Using an offspring-of-twins design, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to paternal alcoholism during the child's first 12 years will increase offspring risk for subsequent alcohol-use disorders (AUD).\nStructured psychiatric interviews assessed history of psychiatric and substance-use disorders in Vietnam Era Twin Registry fathers (n = 512), their offspring (n = 877), and mothers of the offspring (n = 507). Exposure was defined as the fathers' endorsement of any Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fourth Edition, AUD symptom, according to the Lifetime Drinking History assessment (administered in 1999), at any time between off- spring ages 0-12 years; all fathers had satisfied DSM, Third Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R), criteria for alcohol dependence in a 1992 diagnostic interview. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to predict time to first symptom of abuse/dependence in offspring.\nOff- spring exposed to paternal alcoholism were significantly more likely to develop an AUD when compared with offspring of nonalcoholic fathers (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-2.07). Although offspring unexposed to paternal alcoholism did not significantly differ from control offspring (HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 0.93-2.41), the magnitude of association was similar to that in the exposed offspring. There were no significant differences in AUD between offspring of alcoholics who were exposed and those who were not exposed to paternal alcoholism, as long as fathers had satisfied DSM-III-R criteria for alcohol dependence at some point in their lives.\nThere does not appear to be a relationship between exposure to paternal alcoholism during childhood and development of an AUD in offspring. Genetic and high-risk environmental factors that are correlated with lifetime paternal alcoholism may be stronger predictors of offspring AUD than fathers' problem drinking. Future research should be encouraged, using more comprehensive analyses, to examine the role of family genetic influences and other family environmental influences on offspring alcohol outcomes.",

    "abstract": "China has the world's largest concentration of smokers (350 million) and rising alcohol consumption, yet little is known about tobacco and alcohol use aetiology. In 2000, the Chinese National Twin Registry was established to provide a genetically informative resource for investigation of health behaviour including tobacco and alcohol use.\nUsing standard twin methodology, this study aimed to examine the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences on cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking in a sample of adult Chinese twins (n = 1010 individual twins). More than half of the male twins were smokers (58%), and 32.5% reported alcohol consumption. Among male smokers, 46.4% smoked 20 or more cigarettes per day (heavy smokers) and among drinkers, 32.8% consumed one or more drinks per day. Nearly all female twins were non-smokers (99.2%) and non-drinkers (98.7%); therefore, genetic analysis was limited to male data.\nIn men, current smoking was significantly heritable [75.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 56.7-87.5] with no evidence for a significant contribution of shared environmental effects. Heavy smoking was more strongly influenced by genes (66.2%, 95% CI 0-88.4) than shared environment (8.7%, 95% CI 0-71.0). Similarly, current drinking was more strongly influenced by genetic effects (59.5%, 95% CI 0-87.8) than by shared environmental effects (15.3%, 95% CI 0-72.1). Amount of alcohol consumed was influenced to a similar degree by genetic (42.4%, 95% CI 0-91.8) and shared environmental factors (39.2%, 95% CI 0-82.7).\nThese results support findings from twins of Western origin on the aetiology of tobacco and alcohol use and encourage further work in Chinese twins.",

    "abstract": "To determine treatment patterns for youth attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in a general population sample of 1,610 twins.\nTwin pairs ages 7 to 17 years and parents ascertained from birth records in the state of Missouri were interviewed using the Missouri Assessment of Genetics Interview for Children between 1996 and 2001. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine which factors were significant in answering three questions about treatment for ADHD.\nOf 302 boys, 177 (58.6%) and 26 of 57 girls (45.6%) who met full DSM-IV criteria for ADHD received stimulant medication in this sample. Of 314 youths, 111 (35.4%) who received stimulant medication did not meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD.

    "abstract": "The Bamana and Maninka of Mali greatly value twins, and have elaborated a range of cultural beliefs and practices to assure their survival. Rates of twinning among these two ethnic groups average from 15.2/1000 to 17.9/1000 births compared to 10.5/1000 births (without assisted reproduction) in the United States and Great Britain. Twins (flaniw) are regarded as extraordinary beings with unusual powers, and as a gift from the supreme deity. A small altar (sinzin) is maintained in the home of twins, and periodic sacrifices of chicken blood, kola nuts, millet paste and millet beer regularly made to assure their protection. Albinos (y\u00e9fegu\u00e9w) and true and pseudo-hermaphrodites (ty\u00e9t\u00e9nousot\u00e9w) are also considered twin beings. However, they are believed to be the result of aberrant parental social behavior. The Bamana and Maninka believe that all four groups (twins, albinos, hermaphrodites, and pseudo-harmaphrodites) are closely linked to Faro, an androgynous supernatural being who provides equilibrium in the world. Faro is the original albino and hermaphrodite who gave birth to the first pair of twins after self-impregnation. Whenever a twin dies, a small wooden statue is sculpted called a flanitok\u00e9l\u00e9 (twin that remains). This commemorative figure is kept close to the surviving twin, reflecting a belief in the inseparability of twins. Eventually, the surviving twin takes responsibility for the figure. When a surviving twin marries, another figure is often sculpted in the opposite sex from the deceased twin, and placed with the original sculpture. Such commemorative sculptures are not created upon the death of those who are albinos, hermaphrodites, or pseudo-hermaphrodites. In recent years, transformational belief patterns have evolved as increasing numbers of Bamana and Maninka embrace Islam. Traditional beliefs are often given Islamic myths of origin. However, even in this Islamic context, many practices that assure twin survival are maintained.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate genetic analysis was used to examine the genetic and environmental aetiology of the interrelationships of diverse linguistic skills. This study used data from a large sample of 4 1/2-year-old twins who were tested on measures assessing articulation, phonology, grammar, vocabulary, and verbal memory. Phenotypic analysis suggested two latent factors: articulation (2 measures) and general language (the remaining 7), and a genetic model incorporating these factors provided a good fit to the data. Almost all genetic and shared environmental influences on the 9 measures acted through the two latent factors. There was also substantial aetiological overlap between the two latent factors, with a genetic correlation of 0.64 and shared environment correlation of 1.00. We conclude that to a large extent, the same genetic and environmental factors underlie the development of individual differences in a wide range of linguistic skills.",

    "abstract": "Twin gestations are associated with disturbed fetal growth. The aim of this study was to compare body composition measurements of twins to those of singletons.\nAnthropometric and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements were performed in twins and in matched singleton neonates. There were 48 pairs of twins in which 76 infants were appropriate for gestational age (AGA) with birth weights between the 10th and 90th percentile and 20 were small for gestational age (SGA) with birth weights <10th percentiles. Each AGA twin was matched as closely as possible for birth weight to an AGA singleton. Each SGA twin was matched with two cohorts of AGA singletons: one with similar birth weight and one with similar gestation.\nFor AGA twins and their singleton cohort matched for birth weights, profile analysis using repeated measure analysis of variance showed that there were no significant differences in bone, fat and lean mass either as absolute values or as percentage of total weight. This was also the case for body composition of SGA twins compared to singletons matched for birth weight. In contrast, SGA twins have significantly lower absolute amounts of lean with tendency to lower fat and bone mass.\nFor clinically normally grown neonates, with comparable weight, the body composition with respect to bone, fat and lean mass components are similar regardless whether they are products of singleton or twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis is a physiological form of cell death important in normal processes such as morphogenesis and the functioning of the immune system. In addition, defects in the apoptotic process play a major role in a number of important areas of disease, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer. DNA-damage-induced apoptosis plays a vital role in the maintenance of genomic stability by the removal of damaged cells. Previous studies of the apoptotic response (AR) to radiation-induced DNA damage of lymphoid cells from individuals carrying germline TP53 mutations have demonstrated a defective AR compared with normal controls. We have also previously demonstrated that AR is reduced as individuals age. Results from the current study on 108 twins aged 18-80 years confirm these earlier findings that the AR of lymphoid cells to DNA damage is significantly reduced with increasing age. In addition this twin study shows, for the first time, that DNA-damage-induced AR has a strong degree of heritability of 81% (95% confidence interval 67-89%). The vital role of DNA-damage-induced apoptosis in maintaining genetic stability, its relationship with age and its strong heritability underline the importance of this area of biology and suggest areas for further study.",

    "abstract": "Though behavioral genetic studies of aggression have implicated heritable and environmental factors, there is limited understanding of how these factors influence aggression across different settings and over time. Ratings for 732 twins were collected from parents and teachers during middle childhood and early adolescence. Total aggression scores on the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher Report Form (TRF) were examined at each age, across both settings, and developmentally. In this sample, aggressive behavior was moderately to largely heritable at each age within the home (.76-.84) and school (.42-.61). Across each age, ratings by parents and teachers were moderately correlated (.19-.36). Genetic and environmental effects that were limited to a particular setting were important etiological factors for aggressive behavior consistently within each setting, while only genetic factors influenced levels of aggression across both settings. Stability during these ages was due to genetic effects common to each age and the persistence of child-specific environmental experiences within each setting. These results suggest that genetic and environmental influences on children's aggressive behavior are largely setting specific. Levels of aggression seen consistently across both settings are due to genetic influences. Developmentally stable levels of aggressive behavior result from genetic influences common to all ages and individual environmental influences whose effects persist across ages.",

In this study, the International Classification of Diseases- 9th edition code searches and medical record review were used to identify all children with arterial ischemic stroke examined in a pediatric stroke clinic over a 2-year period. Four of the 35 children (11.4%) with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke were twins; none had co-twin demise. No co-twin had any clinical evidence of perinatal stroke. The most common findings on prothrombotic evaluation were elevated antiphospholipid antibodies (2), elevated lipoprotein a (2), and elevated Factor VIIIc (2). Twin gestation without co-twin demise may be a risk factor for perinatal stroke, and might help explain the higher incidence of cerebral palsy in twins.",

The development of TTTS, VGM, and TGA in a single monochorionic pregnancy could be pure coincidence, but there might also be a causative link.

    "abstract": "To identify disease-specific gene expression profiles in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), using complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray analyses on lymphoblastoid B cell lines (LCLs) derived from RA-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins.\nThe cDNA was prepared from LCLs derived from the peripheral blood of 11 pairs of RA-discordant MZ twins. The RA twin cDNA was labeled with cy5 fluorescent dye, and the cDNA of the healthy co-twin was labeled with cy3. To determine relative expression profiles, cDNA from each twin pair was combined and hybridized on 20,000-element microarray chips. Immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the expression of selected gene products in synovial tissue from patients with RA compared with patients with osteoarthritis and normal healthy controls.\nIn RA twin LCLs compared with healthy co-twin LCLs, 1,163 transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. Of these, 747 were overexpressed and 416 were underexpressed. Gene ontology analysis revealed many genes known to play a role in apoptosis, angiogenesis, proteolysis, and signaling. The 3 most significantly overexpressed genes were laeverin (a novel enzyme with sequence homology to CD13), 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (a steroid pathway enzyme), and cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer 61 (a known angiogenic factor). The products of these genes, heretofore uncharacterized in RA, were all abundantly expressed in RA synovial tissues.\nMicroarray cDNA analysis of peripheral blood-derived LCLs from well-controlled patient populations is a useful tool to detect RA-relevant genes and could help in identifying novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Insecure mental representations of attachment, a nearly invariant feature of cluster B personality disorders, have never previously been studied in twins. We conducted the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) on 33 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) female twins reared together as an initial exploration of causal influences on mental representations of attachment. As predicted by attachment theory, we observed substantial twin-twin concordance for attachment security (odds ratio 13.8; P = 0.001), a similar level of concordance between twins and their non-twin siblings, and an inverse relationship between attachment security and current level of aggression (P = 0.01). These data indicate that there are minimal effects of non-shared environmental influences (or measurement error) on attachment classifications derived from the AAI. In this sample of twins with and without histories of Conduct Disorder, mental representations of attachment appear to be highly familial, i.e., strongly influenced by either shared environmental factors, genetic factors, or both.",

    "abstract": "Results of twin studies clearly demonstrate that genetic factors play an important role in the rate of language acquisition and linguistic proficiency attained by normal and impaired children and adults [see Stromswold, K. (2001). The heritability of language: A review and meta-analysis of twin, adoption and linkage studies. Language, 77, 647-723.]. That said, twin-based heritability estimates for language rarely exceed .6 and monozygotic (MZ) twins (who are usually assumed to have identical genetic and environmental endowments) sometimes have very different linguistic profiles. In addition, twins are more likely to suffer linguistic delays and impairments than singletons. Postnatal factors, such as differences in linguistic input twins receive, are usually assumed to be the major reason for these findings. This paper discusses how genetic, epigenetic, and perinatal environmental factors can lower heritability estimates for language, cause MZ twins to be linguistically discordant, and increase the risk of language impairments in twins. We present results from our ongoing Perinatal Environment and Genetic Interaction (PEGI) study that suggest that perinatal environmental factors affect linguistic development more than postnatal factors, and that postnatal factors affect cognitive development more than perinatal factors. Because perinatal factors are overwhelming biological, whereas postnatal factors tend to be psychosocial (e.g., how and how much parents speak to their children), these results support nativist/biological theories of language and language development and call into question empiricist/emergentist theories. These results are also consistent with modularist theories of language. We end by suggesting new methods that can be used to tease apart the effects of prenatal and postnatal environment and to investigate how these factors interact with genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Accurate transmission of chromosomes from parent to progeny cell requires assembly of a bipolar spindle. Centrosomes (spindle pole body in yeast) are critical for the biogenesis of this complex mitotic apparatus since they confer bipolarity on the spindle and serve as the site of microtubule polymerization. In each division cycle, the centrosome is duplicated and the sister-centrosomes move away from each other, forming the two poles of the spindle. While the structure and the duplication of centrosomes have been investigated extensively, the understanding of the control of their segregation remains scant. Recent findings are beginning to yield insights into the regulation of centrosome segregation in yeast and its link to the mitotic kinase.",

    "abstract": "Population-based studies in twins have been of insufficient size to explore the relationship between risk of cerebral palsy and intrauterine growth. Earlier studies in singletons have suggested an optimum size at birth for minimum cerebral palsy risk between the 75th and 90th percentiles of weight for gestational age. We aggregated data from nine European cerebral palsy registers for 1976 to 1990. Using sex-specific fetal growth standards for twins, a z score of weight-for-gestation was derived for each of the 373 twin cases. The rates of cerebral palsy in each z-score band were compared to the rate in the a priori reference band of 0.67 to less than 1.28 (equivalent to the 75th to less than 90th percentiles). In twins born at 32 weeks' gestation or more (92% of all twins), cerebral palsy rates were higher for both light and heavy-for-gestation babies compared to an optimum (i.e., minimum risk) in the reference band. However, the rate ratio for heavy babies (90th percentile or greater) did not reach conventional (95% confidence intervals [CI]) statistical significance (rate ratios = 1.76; 90% CI 1.02-3.03). For twins born at less than 32 weeks, the significantly higher risk for cerebral palsy was observed consistently in all z-score bands less than average compared to the reference band. This multi-center study demonstrates that for twins born at 32 weeks' gestation or more, an increased risk of cerebral palsy is associated with deviations from optimal intrauterine growth at about 1 standard deviation above mean weight, as was earlier reported for singletons. For twins born at less than 32 weeks' gestation, this pattern is only demonstrable for babies weighing below the optimum weight-for-gestation.",

For England and Wales, presence of limiting long-term illnesses and self-rated health status was also investigated. Overall similar health and mortality was found for twin parents and the whole population although both life table methods and survival analysis suggested a slight excess mortality among older cohorts of twin mothers in England and Wales.",

    "abstract": "Marfan's syndrome is a hereditary connective tissue disease, in which cardiovascular abnormalities (especially aortic root dilatation) are the most important cause of morbidity and mortality. In this report, we describe two 24-year-old twins, with a history of surgery for lens subluxation and severe cardiovascular manifestations secondary to Marfan's syndrome. One of the twins suffered a type A aortic dissection, which required replacement of the ascending aorta, and the other twin had an aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta (46mm) and was prescribed medical treatment with atenolol and periodic controls to detect the presence of a critical diameter (50mm) that would indicate the need for prophylactic surgery.",

    "abstract": "We report monozygotic twins with congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis, whose lesions initially presented as hemorrhagic bullae at birth with rapid progression into crusted papules the following day. Physical examination disclosed crusted papules on the right side of the neck of twin 1 and a similar solitary lesion on the lateral side of the right thumb of twin 2. Excisional biopsy specimen findings of the neck and thumb lesions were consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which was further confirmed by positive CD1a staining. The lesions resolved completely by 2 months with no evidence of recurrence or systemic involvement. Congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis is a rare, self-limited form of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Although familial clustering in Langerhans cell histiocytosis was previously reported, to the best of our knowledge there is no report suggesting familial clustering in congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis. Our patients are interesting in terms of raising the question of whether the presence of congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis in monozygotic twins is implicative of a genetic role in its pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "To determine the effects of genetic versus environmental influences on smoking initiation (SI) and smoking persistence (SP).\nNative California twins (32,359 pairs), who completed a questionnaire in 1992 or 1998 to 2001, were studied. Standard epidemiologic and genetic analyses were conducted using multiple logistic regression and biometric models to determine factors related to smoking phenotype.\nThe strongest influence on SI was having a co-twin who ever smoked; the adjusted odds ratio was 9.7 [95% confidence limits (CL), 8.8-10.6] among monozygotic twins and 5.7 (95% CL, 5.2-6.2) among dizygotic like-sex pairs. The risk of SP was also increased if the co-twin currently smoked [adjusted odds ratios, 3.5 (95% CL, 3.0-4.1) for monozygotic twins and 2.3 (95% CL, 2.0-2.7) for like-sex dizygotic pairs]. The proportions of variance due to genetic effects, shared environment, and individual environment for SI were 31.6% (24.2-39.1), 47.5% (41.1-53.7), and 20.9% (18.8-23.1) for females, and 71.2% (66.7-75.4), 12.0% (8.7-15.7), and 16.7% (15.0-18.7) for males. For SP, estimates were identical by gender: 54.6% (43.6-65.5), 8.6% (0-17.1), and 36.8% (32.9-40.9). Modification of SI by closeness between twins was found, but little difference was seen for SP by closeness, birth cohort, or age.\nGender differences in the pattern of genetic and environmental determinants of SI indicate that gender-specific approaches may be needed for smoking prevention efforts. Modification of genetic effects by closeness between twins and birth cohort suggests that environmental interventions could reduce a heritable propensity to smoke. However, the apparently heritable tendency to continue smoking is unaffected by gender, age, birth cohort, or closeness between twins.",

Multivariate genetic model fitting revealed that common additive genetic effects comprised 12.8% of the phenotypic correlation between insomnia and sleepiness (p < .01) and 10% of the phenotypic correlation between insomnia and obesity (p < .01). The phenotypic correlation between sleepiness and obesity was not due to common additive genetic effects.\nInsomnia, sleepiness, and obesity are under strong genetic influence.

    "abstract": "The goal of the present study is to examine genetic and environmental influences on maternal and teacher ratings of Attention Problems (AP) in 7-year-old children. Teachers completed the Teacher Report Form (N=2259 pairs), and mothers the Child Behavior Checklist (N=2057 pairs). Higher correlations were found in twins rated by the same teacher than in twins rated by different teachers. This can be explained by rater bias or by a greater environmental sharing in twins, who are in the same classroom. We further found that 41% of the variation in maternal and teacher ratings is explained by a common factor. The heritability of this common factor is 78%. The heritabilities of the rater specific factors of mothers and teachers are 76% and 39%, respectively. Because Attention Problems that are persistent over situations may indicate more serious behavior problems than context dependent Attention Problems, we believe that gene finding strategies should focus on this common phenotype.",

    "abstract": "The super-sensitivity of the neurohormone melatonin to light in patients with bipolar disorder provides evidence of the circadian nature of the disorder. This response has been proposed as an endophenotype for identifying people at risk of the disorder and guiding investigations of molecular genetic targets. However, before this response is used as an endophenotypic marker, the heritable nature of melatonin sensitivity in the normal population must be established. The aim of this study was to investigate the heritability of nocturnal melatonin secretion and sensitivity to light in monozygotic and dizygotic twins with no psychiatric history. This study investigated overall melatonin levels (between 2000 and 2400 h) and suppression by 500 lx of light (between 2400 and 0100 h) in 20 pairs of twins (nine monozygotic, 11 dizygotic). The results indicate that melatonin secretion is highly heritable with secretion in one twin being a significant predictor of secretion in their twin in both monozygotic and dizygotic pairs. In relation to light sensitivity, genetic loading appears to play a significant role with the greatest concordance between monozygotic twins, followed by dizygotic twins and finally low concordance in unrelated individuals. This provides additional support for the usefulness of melatonin sensitivity to light as a potential endophenotypic marker of bipolar affective disorder.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to compare uterine contraction frequency in twins versus singletons and to determine if contraction frequency can be an efficient predictor of spontaneous preterm birth in twin gestations.\nFifty-nine twin and 306 singleton gestations were enrolled between 22 and 24 weeks at 11 centers. Contraction frequency was recorded with a home uterine activity monitor (HUAM) 2 or more times per day on 2 or more days per week until delivery or 36-6/7 weeks. Masked HUAM data were interpreted according to standard protocol. Repeated measures analyses were used to determine whether mean or maximum uterine contraction frequency per hour differed between singleton and twin gestations across gestational age, by time of day, and by delivery before 35 weeks or beyond. Uterine contraction frequency was also evaluated by logistic regression and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves as tests to predict spontaneous preterm birth.\nThere were 34,908 hours of HUAM data recorded by the 306 singleton gestations and 5,427 hours by the 59 women with twins. Uterine contraction frequency was significantly greater in twins (P = .002) compared with singletons, regardless of gestational age. Contraction frequency in twins increased significantly with gestational age and time of day (1600-0359 hours); but was not associated with spontaneous preterm birth. Maximum uterine contraction frequency was associated with preterm birth less than 35 weeks but only in the morning (am) recording (0400-1559) and at the 29- to 30-week gestational age interval. This relationship was modest (odds ratio 1-2) and not consistent across gestational age or between the am and afternoon/evening (pm) monitoring sessions. ROC analysis revealed no contraction frequency that efficiently identified twins who delivered prematurely at any 2-week gestational age interval.\nMean uterine contraction frequency was significantly higher for twin gestations than singletons throughout the latter half of pregnancy and between 1600 and 0359 hours but was not higher among twins who delivered less than 35 weeks' gestation. Neither maximum am or pm contraction frequency predicted spontaneous preterm birth less than 35 weeks' gestation in twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Girls who grow up in households with an unrelated adult male reach menarche earlier than peers, a finding hypothesized to be an evolutionary strategy for families under stress. The authors tested the alternative hypothesis that nonrandom selection into stepfathering due to shared environmental and/or genetic predispositions creates a spurious relation between stepfathering and early menarche. Using the unique controls for genetic and shared environmental experiences offered by the children-of-twins design, the authors found that cousins discordant for stepfathering did not differ in age of menarche. Moreover, controlling for mother's age of menarche eliminated differences in menarcheal age associated with stepfathering in unrelated girls. These findings strongly suggest selection, and not causation, accounts for the relationship between stepfathering and early menarche.",

    "abstract": "To compare the differences in growth and physiologic regulation in cobedded preterm twins versus individually bedded preterm twins while in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\nInfants born between 28 to 34 weeks gestation in a Level III NICU were eligible for enrollment into the study. Forty-nine sets of twins were enrolled in the study and 41 sets were ultimately analyzed. There were 21 twin sets (42 infants) in the experimental group and 20 sets (40 infants) in the control group.\nA prospective randomized design was used.\nParents of twins in a level III NICU were approached for consent to participate in the study. Twins were randomized using sealed envelopes that designated placement in either the control or experimental group. Twin sets who were randomized to the control group received routine care in separate beds. Twin sets in the experimental group received routine care in the same bed. Guidelines for positioning of cobedded twins were utilized. Treatment and data collection started when infants met the inclusion criteria for the study.\nMeasurements of weekly weight gain and episodes of apnea/bradycardia/desaturation (A/B/D) were collected for each group.\nAfter adjusting for baseline weight in an analysis of covariance model, the cobedded group demonstrated a significantly higher mean weight compared to the control group at week 1 (1,644 vs. 1,572 grams, respectively, F = 11.6, P = 0.001) and at week 2 (1,755 vs. 1,693 grams, respectively, F = 5.7, P = 0.02). There was no difference in the median number of total combined A/B/D episodes between the 2 groups.\nA greater increase in mean weight gain was noted in the cobedded group compared to the control group.",

    "abstract": "We examined whether there are genetic influences on nicotine withdrawal, and whether there are genetic factors specific to nicotine withdrawal, after controlling for factors responsible for risk of progression beyond experimentation with cigarettes and for quantity smoked (average number of cigarettes per day at peak lifetime use).\nEpidemiologic and genetic analyses were conducted using telephone diagnostic interview data from young adult Australian twins reporting any cigarette use (3026 women, 2553 men; mean age 30 years).\nGenetic analysis of the eight symptoms of DSM-IV nicotine withdrawal suggests heritability is intermediate for most symptoms (26-43%), and similar in men and women. The exceptions were depressed mood upon withdrawal, which had stronger additive genetic influences in men (53%) compared to women (29%), and decreased heart rate, which had low heritability (9%). Although prevalence rates were substantially lower for DSM-IV nicotine withdrawal syndrome (15.9%), which requires impairment, than for the DSM-IV nicotine dependence withdrawal criterion (43.6%), heritability was similar for both measures: as high as 47%. Genetic modeling of smoking more than 1 or 2 cigarettes lifetime ('progression'), quantity smoked and nicotine withdrawal found significant genetic overlap across all three components of nicotine use/dependence (genetic correlations = 0.53-0.76). Controlling for factors associated with risk of cigarette smoking beyond experimentation and quantity smoked, evidence for genetic influences specific to nicotine withdrawal (up to 23% of total variance) remained.\nOur results suggest that at least some individuals become 'hooked' or progress in the smoking habit, in part, because of a vulnerability to nicotine withdrawal.",

To determine the genetic contribution, concordance rates in a subset of 252 monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs were compared.\nThe study population had a mean gestational age of 29 weeks and birth weight of 1286 g. After controlling for effects of covariates, the twin data showed that 41.3%, 51.9%, and 65.2%, respectively, of the variances in liability for intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia could be accounted for by genetic and shared environmental factors. Among the 63 monozygotic twin pairs, the observed concordance for bronchopulmonary dysplasia was significantly higher than the expected concordance; 12 of 18 monozygotic twin pairs with > or =1 affected member had both members affected versus 3.69 expected. After controlling for covariates, genetic factors accounted for 53% of the variance in liability for bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\nTwin analyses show that intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia are familial in origin.

    "abstract": "Sex differences in the etiology of normal cognitive functioning in aging remain largely unexplored. We conducted an investigation of genetic and environmental contributions to sex differences in level of cognitive performance and rate of decline in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) (Finkel & Pedersen, 2004) data set. Behavioral genetic parameterizations of a latent growth curve model were fit to longitudinal data on 11 cognitive measures. Seven hundred and ninety-eight non-demented individuals had cognitive data across four waves of measurement covering 13 years. Participants ranged in age from 44 to 88 at first testing wave; 60% were female. Results indicated sex differences in mean performance for five cognitive measures and in rates of decline for Information and Card Rotations. Only Synonyms demonstrated sex differences in genetic and environmental contributions to mean performance: heritability was higher in men than women. Despite differential longevity and susceptibility to disease, there are no consistent indications that men and women show different patterns of cognitive aging.",

    "abstract": "There is a dose-response positive relationship between type A behavior (TABP) and cardiovascular disease-related symptoms. Estimates of heritability for TABP from previous studies vary; this might be explained by limitations in the sizes and compositions of the samples.\nThis study combines a large sample size, twin and parental, data from males and females, two generations of young adults and older adults, and the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) and full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation. To assess TABP, the Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS) was collected from MZ and DZ twins and their parents (n = 1670 twin families). Structural equation modeling is used to evaluate and estimate the effects of additive and nonadditive genetic effects, nonshared environmental effects, and competitive sibling interaction.\nForty-five percent of the variance in TABP was the result of genetic factors (28% were additive and 17% were nonadditive). The remaining 55% of the variance was explained by environmental factors not shared by the members of the same family. Competitive sibling interaction effects were not significant. There was no evidence of sex differences either in variances or means.\nUnderstanding the sources of variance on TABP is important for therapy and prevention. According to the present results, the relevant environmental factors for the development of TABP are not shared by the members of the same family. The genetic portion of the variance is also worth considering for therapeutic purposes. Although the genetic code cannot be altered, its effects on behavior may be modifiable through the treatment of the biological mediators.",

The purpose of this study is to assess the developmental stability of the CBCL-JBD phenotype across ages 7, 10, and 12 years in a large population-based twin sample and to examine its genetic architecture.\nLongitudinal data on Dutch mono- and dizygotic twin pairs (N = 8013 pairs) are analyzed to decompose the stability of the CBCL-JBD phenotype into genetic and environmental contributions.\nHeritability of the CBCL-JBD increases with age (from 63% to 75%), whereas the effects of shared environment decrease (from 20% to 8%). The stability of the CBCL-JBD phenotype is high, with correlations between .66 and .77 across ages 7, 10, and 12 years. Genetic factors account for the majority of the stability of this phenotype. There were no sex differences in genetic architecture.\nRoughly 80% of the stability in childhood CBCL-JBD is a result of additive genetic effects.",

    "abstract": "Patients may present with cognitive impairment in the euthymic phase of affective disorder, but it is unclear whether the impairment is prevalent before onset of the illness. The aim of the present study was to examine the hypothesis that genetic liability to affective disorder is associated with cognitive impairment.\nIn a cross-sectional high-risk case-control study, healthy monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins with (High-Risk twins) and without (the control group/Low-Risk twins) a co-twin history of affective disorder were identified through nationwide registers. Cognitive performance of 203 High-Risk and Low-Risk twins was compared.\nHealthy twins discordant for unipolar disorder showed lower performance on almost all measures of cognitive function: selective and sustained attention, executive function, language processing and working and declarative memory, and also after adjustment for demographic variables, subclinical symptoms and minor psychopathology. Healthy twins discordant for bipolar disorder showed lower performance on tests measuring episodic and working memory, also after adjustment for the above-mentioned covariables. The discrete cognitive impairment found seemed to be related to genetic liability, as the MZ High-Risk twins showed significant impairment on selective and sustained attention, executive function, language processing and working and declarative memory, whereas the DZ High-Risk twins presented with significantly lower scores only on language processing and episodic memory.\nThe hypothesis that discrete cognitive impairment is present before the onset of the affective disorder and is genetically transmitted was supported. Thus, cognitive function may be a candidate endophenotype for affective disorders.",

    "abstract": "Children of alcoholics are significantly more likely to experience high-risk environmental exposures, including prenatal substance exposure, and are more likely to exhibit externalizing problems [e.g. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)]. While there is evidence that genetic influences and prenatal nicotine and/or alcohol exposure play separate roles in determining risk of ADHD, little has been done on determining the joint roles that genetic risk associated with maternal alcohol use disorder (AUD) and prenatal risk factors play in determining risk of ADHD.\nUsing a children-of-twins design, diagnostic telephone interview data from high-risk families (female monozygotic and dizygotic twins concordant or discordant for AUD as parents) and control families targeted from a large Australian twin cohort were analyzed using logistic regression models.\nOffspring of twins with a history of AUD, as well as offspring of non-AUD monozygotic twins whose co-twin had AUD, were significantly more likely to exhibit ADHD than offspring of controls. This pattern is consistent with a genetic explanation for the association between maternal AUD and increased offspring risk of ADHD. Adjustment for prenatal smoking, which remained significantly predictive, did not remove the significant genetic association between maternal AUD and offspring ADHD.\nWhile maternal smoking during pregnancy probably contributes to the association between maternal AUD and offspring ADHD risk, the evidence for a significant genetic correlation suggests: (i) pleiotropic genetic effects, with some genes that influence risk of AUD also influencing vulnerability to ADHD; or (ii) ADHD is a direct risk-factor for AUD.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies are used extensively to decompose the variance of a trait, mainly to estimate the heritability of the trait. A second purpose of such studies is to estimate to what extent the non-genetic variance is shared or specific to individuals. To a lesser extent the twin studies have been used in bivariate or multivariate analysis to elucidate common genetic factors to two or more traits.\nIn the present study the variances of traits related to lipid metabolism is decomposed in a relatively large Danish twin population, including bivariate analysis to detect possible common genetic factors of the traits.\nThe heritabilities of apolipoprotein B and E, cholesterol, LDL, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) were significant in the general population, although gender-specific levels and significance were detected. Heritabilities of apolipoprotein A1, triglycerides, and very low density protein (VLDL) were only significant when the population was stratified according to gender.",

    "abstract": "Asplenia syndrome is one of the heterotaxy syndromes, which many familial and animal studies suggest are caused by the loss of adequate genetic control of normal left-right asymmetry development. Moreover, there has not been any environmental factor documented to cause these syndromes. Asplenia syndrome occurring in a pair of monozygotic twins is reported. In view of the negative family history, a new germline mutant gene might be the aetiology of our patients. Both twins are associated with some degree of discordant complex heart defects within the context of a high degree of \"mirror-image\" of the unpaired thoracoabdominal organs.\nThis report implies that sporadic asplenia syndrome might associate with new mutations and further genetic study may be indicated.

    "abstract": "Head injury is an inconsistently reported risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Many related variables might confound this association, such as differences in childhood and adolescent lifestyles or genetically determined risk-taking behaviors. Twin studies circumvent some of these problems, because twins are genetically and environmentally much more similar than typical cases and control subjects.\nWe conducted a case-control study in 93 twin pairs discordant for PD ascertained from the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council World War II Veteran Twins Cohort.\nA prior head injury with amnesia or loss of consciousness was associated with an increased risk for PD (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-11; p = 0.014). Truncating observations 10 years before PD onset enhanced the association. Though less precise, the association was somewhat stronger in monozygotic than in dizygotic pairs. Risk increased further with a subsequent head injury (p trend = 0.022) and with head injuries requiring hospitalization. Duration of unconsciousness was not associated. In a subanalysis of 18 pairs concordant for PD, the twin with younger onset PD was more likely to have sustained a head injury, although numbers were small.\nOur results suggest that mild-to-moderate closed head injury may increase PD risk decades later.",

In the present study, we reanalyze DSM-III-R diagnostic data on middle-aged male twin pairs from the VETR study using latent class methods. We identify four subtypes based on 15 diagnostic categories. We then show that these subtypes are strongly associated with differential rates of transitions in drug use histories, with increased risks in relatives for depression, alcohol, drug and ASPD, as well as with a variety of non-normative and deviant behaviors in youth and in adulthood. We use the result of these analyses to show how the use of a particular drug disorder phenotype for selecting cases could impact final sample composition.",

    "abstract": "Non-random mating affects population variation for substance use and dependence. Developmentally, mate selection leading to positive spousal correlations for genetic similarity may result in increased risk for substance use and misuse in offspring. Mate selection varies by cohort and thus, assortative mating in one generation may produce marked changes in rates of substance use in the next. We aim to clarify the mechanisms contributing to spousal similarity for cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption.\nUsing data from female twins and their male spouses, we fit univariate and bivariate twin models to examine the contribution of primary assortative mating and reciprocal marital interaction to spousal resemblance for regular cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence, and for regular alcohol use and alcohol dependence.\nWe found that assortative mating significantly influenced regular smoking, regular alcohol use, nicotine dependence and alcohol dependence. The bivariate models for cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption also highlighted the importance of primary assortative mating on all stages of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, with additional evidence for assortative mating across the two stages of alcohol consumption.\nWomen who regularly used, and subsequently were dependent on cigarettes or alcohol were more likely to marry men with similar behaviors. After mate selection had occurred, one partner's cigarette or alcohol involvement did not significantly modify the other partner's involvement with these psychoactive substances.",

    "abstract": "The autism spectrum encompasses a set of complex multigenic developmental disorders that severely impact the development of language, non-verbal communication, and social skills, and are associated with odd, stereotyped, repetitive behavior and restricted interests. To date, diagnosis of these neurologically based disorders relies predominantly upon behavioral observations often prompted by delayed speech or aberrant behavior, and there are no known genes that can serve as definitive biomarkers for the disorders.\nHere we demonstrate, for the first time, that lymphoblastoid cell lines from monozygotic twins discordant with respect to severity of autism and/or language impairment exhibit differential gene expression patterns on DNA microarrays. Furthermore, we show that genes important to the development, structure, and/or function of the nervous system are among the most differentially expressed genes, and that many of these genes map closely in silico to chromosomal regions containing previously reported autism candidate genes or quantitative trait loci.\nOur results provide evidence that novel candidate genes for autism may be differentially expressed in lymphoid cell lines from individuals with autism spectrum disorders. This finding further suggests the possibility of developing a molecular screen for autism based on expressed biomarkers in peripheral blood lymphocytes, an easily accessible tissue. In addition, gene networks are identified that may play a role in the pathophysiology of autism.",

    "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that not only genetic but also environmental factors contribute to the onset of schizophrenia. We therefore conducted psychophysiological studies on a pair of identical twins discordant for schizophrenia, to differentiate non-genetic from genetic indexes possibly associated with this disease. The affected and unaffected twins were 28 year-old females. The affected twin was diagnosed as having schizophrenia based on the Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition revised (DMS-III-R), whereas the unaffected twin had no psychiatric disorders. The brain potentials evoked by visual stimulation (visual event-related potential [visual ERP]) were recorded. The components of the visual ERP, which are believed to reflect pattern cognition, semantic processing and the failure to use preceding word information, were compared with normal subjects. Both twins showed abnormal semantic processing and similar failure to use preceding word information. Abnormality of semantic processing was marked in the affected twin. These results indicate that failure to use preceding word information might reflect only genetic factors, whereas abnormal semantic processing might reflect both genetic and non-genetic factors because the affected twin was considered to show accelerated deterioration after the disease onset. However, only the affected twin showed abnormal pattern cognition, which might be attributable to non-genetic factors such as an acquired vulnerability to schizophrenia. We suggest that the impairment of pattern cognition evaluated by visual ERP may be a critical index for the onset of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the accuracy of our previously published and prospectively validated institution-specific singleton transcerebellar diameter (TCD) nomogram in the prediction of gestational age (GA) in twin pregnancies. We further evaluated whether the prediction of GA in twin gestations using the singleton TCD nomogram differs between monochorionic and dichorionic twins.\nIn our previously published studies, we retrospectively constructed a cross-sectional nomogram using TCD measurements in 24,026 well-dated, singleton fetuses, and prospectively validated the nomogram using 2,597 singleton fetuses. The current study comprised of 1,278 well-dated twins (19.6% monochorionic) seen in our ultrasound unit between August 1994 and May 2003, and the singleton TCD nomogram was validated in these twin gestations. The actual GA was subtracted from the GA predicted by the TCD nomogram and the concordance between actual and predicted GAs was assessed on the basis of the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). This was performed separately for monochorionic and dichorionic twins.\nConcordance between the actual and predicted twin TCD measurements based on our previously published singleton TCD nomogram was high (Pearson's correlation, r = 0.95, P < .0001). Between 16 and 23 weeks' gestation, the predicted mean GA was within 6 days of actual GA. Between 24 and 30 weeks, the predicted mean GA was within 3 days, and at 32 weeks or more, the predicted mean GA was within 5 days of the actual GA. Prediction of GA based on the singleton TCD nomogram was equally accurate in both monochorionic and dichorionic twin gestations (P = .686).\nThis study demonstrates that our previously validated singleton TCD nomogram is reliable and accurate in twins irrespective of placental chorionicity.",

    "abstract": "The differences in incidence rates of Haemophilus influenzae type b disease and the variation in Hib conjugate vaccine efficacy achieved among different ethnic groups suggest genetic influences on the immune response to Hib vaccine. The serum anti-PRP antibody concentration of 43 monozygotic (MZ) and 147 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs in the Gambia was measured using a standardised Hib ELISA. Intrapair correlations for MZ and DZ twin pairs were compared and heritability in antibody responses to Hib conjugate vaccine was estimated to be 51% (95% CI: 32-66%), indicating a significant genetic contribution in the response. We conclude that genetic factors may be involved in the variation in immune response to Hib vaccine observed in different populations and may contribute to cases of vaccine failure.",

    "abstract": "Lower urinary tract symptoms, which are common in older men, are thought to be determined genetically and by modifiable environmental risk factors. We examined the contribution of these 2 etiologic components in a cohort of U.S. twins.\nIn 1998, a questionnaire that assessed lower urinary tract symptoms, weight, height, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and physical activity was sent out to members of the National Academy of Science-National Research Council Twins Registry. We analyzed 1,723 complete twin pairs with information on lower urinary tract symptoms and zygosity and who did not have a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer. We calculated concordance rates of categories of the International Prostate Symptom Score in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. Generalized estimating equations were used to calculate the odds ratio of having high-moderate/severe lower urinary tract symptoms.\nConcordance rates were higher in MZ than in DZ twins with concordance rate ratios of 2.2 and 6.9 depending on the specificity of definition of symptoms. Genetic factors contributed 72% to the risk of high-moderate/severe lower urinary tract symptoms. Taking into account correlated individuals, we observed high odds of lower urinary tract symptoms in obese men compared with lean men (odds ratio = 1.91; 95% confidence interval = 1.16-3.15 comparing first versus fourth quartile). Cigarette smoking was not associated with lower urinary tract symptoms, but alcohol consumption was positively associated. Men who were more physically active tended to have lower odds of lower urinary tract symptoms compared with less active men (0.62; 0.36-1.08).\nThe findings indicate a strong genetic component of lower urinary tract symptoms, but also support previous studies that modifiable environmental risk factors are associated with this condition.",

    "abstract": "Twin birth weight discordance is associated with poor perinatal outcome. Three cases of severe discordant twins were serially assessed by ultrasound biometry and the Doppler ultrasonography of both the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and umbilical artery (UA) to measure pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), and the systolic and diastolic ratio (S/D ratio). The birth weight discrepancies in three cases are 38%, 69% and 68%, respectively. Doppler velocimetry revealed a discrepancy in the S/D ratio of MCA and UA more than 15%. Absent end-diastolic flow, or the brain sparing effect, was noted in three small twins. Cerebral-umbilical S/D ratio (CUR) (MCA/UA) of the twins was above 1 in large ones and below 1 in small ones. The small twin in case 3 expired after delivery. In conclusion, if the CUR of the S/D ratio of the fetus is below 1, the prognosis might be poor and fetal weight discordancy might be progressively larger.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative measurements of urinary parameters are valuable clinical tools for predicting the risk of nephrolithiasis. To our knowledge no previous studies have evaluated the heritability of urinary stone risk in identical twins. Because these individuals share identical genetics, the R defined by their phenotypic data are theoretically equal to the entire population H2.\nA total of 12 sets of healthy homozygous twins, including 4 males and 8 females for a total of 24 individuals, with a mean age of 25.9 years (range 21 to 36) volunteered for this study. All subjects provided informed written consent before assessment. Urinary stone risk profiles were done elsewhere on 2 consecutive days after 5 days of a standardized diet (170 mEq Na and 2500 kcal). Linear regression was performed on the data to determine R. Because identical twins were used, R was theoretically an estimate of H2.\nCertain urinary stone risk markers were highly heritable, including urinary calcium (94%), oxalate (94%), citrate (95%), uric acid (96%) and brushite supersaturation (90%), as determined by genotype (H2 90% or greater). Uric acid supersaturation (58%) and urinary sodium (64%) had low degrees of heritability.\nH2 is a measure of how much of the total variance in phenotype results from differences in genotype, as opposed to environmental differences. For example, an H2 of 95% for citrate suggests that genetic differences account for 95% of the variation in urinary citrate and environmental differences account for the remaining 5%. Therefore urinary calcium, oxalate and citrate are primarily determined by genotype, while environmental factors, particularly those that impact urine pH and urinary volume, may be increasingly important for determining uric acid supersaturation.",

Transcripts provided the data for discourse analysis of the use of two interpretative repertoires.\nOntario, Canada.\n19 women pregnant with twins.\nThe first interpretative repertoire represented caring for twins as fundamentally distinct from caring for singly born babies, and therefore emphasised the commonality of mothers of twins regardless of their background or situation. The second highlighted the uniqueness and individuality of each person. These repertoires intersect with discourses of baby feeding and good mothering, resulting in a complex discursive interplay of similarity and difference, commonality and individuality, information seeking, baby feeding and good mothering. Participants used the two interpretative repertoires to (1) frame information needs; (2) construct complex accounts of the biomedical, experiential and personalised authority of information sources; (3) describe the helpfulness of information sources independent of their authority; and (4) describe the barriers encountered in the finding appropriate sources of baby-feeding information in pregnancy.\nUnderstanding and respecting the discursive constructions of pregnancy and mothering can help practitioners understand the complex discursive interplay underlying participants' baby-feeding decisions, and may facilitate more sensitive support for women's individual needs and understandings.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies have had a key role in the evaluation of heritability, a population-based estimate of the genetic contribution to phenotypic variation. These studies have led to the revelation that most normal and disease phenotypes are to some extent heritable. Recently, interest has shifted from phenomenological heritability to the identification of trait-specific genes. The era of twin studies, however, is not over: recent epigenetic and global gene expression studies suggest that the most interesting findings in twin-based research are still to come. The increasing realization of the influence of epigenetics in phenotypic outcomes means that the molecular mechanisms behind phenotypic differences in genetically identical organisms can be explored. Analyses of epigenetic twin differences and similarities might yet challenge the fundamental principles of complex biology, primarily the dogma that complex phenotypes result from DNA sequence variants interacting with the environment.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of assisted reproduction has resulted in a growing number of multiple births. These infants and their parents experience increased, and sometimes unique, medical and psychological risks when compared to singletons. Rates of maternal morbidity, fetal and infant mortality are increased in multiple pregnancies. Twins have a death rate four times higher than singletons and this figure is six times higher for triplets. The main reason is preterm and very preterm birth in multiples, resulting in low and very low birth weight children. Perinatal mortality and morbidity are also more elevated in monozygotic (MZ) twins as compared to dizygotic (DZ) twins. In addition to an increased risk of mortality, multiples have higher rates of morbidity, specifically cerebral palsy and mental subnormality. Language and speech delays are more pronounced in multiples, as are cognitive delays, motor development, behavioural problems and difficulties in parent-child interactions. Depression among parents of multiples is reported to be higher than those of singletons. This paper aims to critically appraise the literature regarding the aforementioned topics, including a comparison between the outcomes for iatrogenic and spontaneously conceived twins and to suggest areas for further research.",

    "abstract": "Selective mutism is a rare social anxiety disorder characterized by a total lack of speech in certain specific situations despite the ability to speak in others. Both genetic and psychosocial factors are thought to be involved in its presentation, persistence, and response to treatment. This case report describes a case of young female monozygotic twins who presented with selective mutism and their treatment spanning a 2-year period. It highlights the strong genetic association along with environmental factors such as social isolation and consequences of maternal social phobia, all contributing to treatment resistance, despite an intensive multimodal biopsychosocial approach. General issues related to the difficulties in treating monozygotic twins are also addressed.",

    "abstract": "As part of a longitudinal observational prospective study (Dundee University Scottish Keratoconus Study, DUSKS) a caucasian female subject was identified with keratoconus affecting both corneas. Of interest was that the subject's mother was a monozygotic twin, however, the mother was reportedly unaffected by keratoconus, although her sister (the subject's aunt) had been diagnosed with keratoconus.\nComputer video-keratoscopy (CVK) was undertaken was on this family to clarify this apparent discordance.\nCVK demonstrated the variable expression of the keratoconic phenotype, by identifying evidence of subclinical keratoconus in the 'unaffected' twin.\nSo far only one set of monozygotic twins with keratoconus have been reported within the UK, this paper reports a second. Since CVK has been available the majority agree on concordance of keratoconus expression but not all, including this study. If monozygotic twin studies demonstrate heterogeneity of keratoconus this may at least explain the contradictory data that exists within the literature and why the inheritance pattern of keratoconus is still unclear in 2005.",

A definite diagnosis was made by genetic analysis. Our cases are unique in being the first identical twins with NS diagnosed by a novel mutation in the SPINK5 gene. NS should be considered in differential diagnosis in children who have generalized erythema with intractable eczematous lesions and elevated levels of IgE.",
