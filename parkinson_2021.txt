    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the cognitive degenerative disorders of the central nervous system that affects the motor system. Gait dysfunction represents the pathology of motor symptom while gait analysis provides clinicians with subclinical information reflecting subtle differences between PD patients and healthy controls (HCs). Currently neurologists usually assess several clinical manifestations of the PD patients and rate the severity level according to some established criteria. This is highly dependent on clinician's expertise which is subjective and ineffective. In the present study we address these issues by proposing a hybrid signal processing and machine learning based gait classification system for gait anomaly detection and severity rating of PD patients. Time series of vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) data are utilized to represent discriminant gait information. First, phase space of the VGRF is reconstructed, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear gait system dynamics are preserved. Then Shannon energy is used to extract the characteristic envelope of the phase space signal. Third, Shannon energy envelope is decomposed into high and low resonance components using dual ",

    "abstract": "During the caudo-rostral progression of Lewy pathology, the amygdala is involved relatively early in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, lesser is known about the volumetric differences at the amygdala subdivisions, although the evidence mainly implicates the olfactory amygdala. We aimed to investigate the volumetric differences between the amygdala's nuclear and sectoral subdivisions in the PD cognitive impairment continuum compared to healthy controls (HC). The volumes of nine nuclei of the amygdala were estimated with FreeSurfer (nuclear parcellation-NP) from T1-weighted images of PD patients with normal cognition (PD-CN), PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), PD with dementia (PD-D), and HC. The appropriate nuclei were then merged to obtain three sectors of the amygdala (sectoral parcellation-SP). The nuclear and sectoral volumes were compared among the four groups and between the hyposmic and normosmic PD patients. There was a significant difference in the total amygdala volume among the four groups. In terms of nuclei, the bilateral cortico-amygdaloid transition area (CAT) and sectors superficial cortex-like region (sCLR) volumes of PD-MCI and PD-D were less than those of the PD-CN and HC. A linear discriminant analysis revealed that left CAT and left sCLR volumes classified the PD-CN and cognitively impaired PD (PD-CI: PD-MCI plus PD-D) with 90.7% accuracy according to NP and 85.2% accuracy to SP. Similarly, left CAT and sCLR volumes correctly identified the hyposmic and normosmic PD with 64.8% and 61.1% accuracies. Notably, the left olfactory amygdala volume successfully discriminated cognitive impairment in PD and could be used as neuroimaging-based support for PD-CI diagnosis.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11571-022-09887-y.",

In this demo, we demonstrate that our preliminary analysis and results show the potential of measuring kinetic tremors effectively using these methods.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common and complex neurodegenerative disorder with five stages on the Hoehn and Yahr scaling. Characterizing brain function alterations with progression of early stage disease would support accurate disease staging, development of new therapies, and objective monitoring of disease progression or treatment response. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising tool in revealing functional connectivity (FC) differences and developing biomarkers in PD. While fMRI and FC data have been utilized for diagnosis of PD through application of machine learning approaches such as support vector machine and logistic regression, the characterization of FC changes in early-stage PD has not been investigated. Given the complexity and non-linearity of fMRI data, we propose the use of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to distinguish the early stages of PD and understand related functional brain changes. The study included 84 subjects (56 in stage 2 and 28 in stage 1) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), the largest-available public PD dataset. Under a repeated 10-fold stratified cross-validation, the LSTM model reached an accuracy of 71.63%, 13.52% higher than the best traditional machine learning method and 11.56% higher than a CNN model, indicating significantly better robustness and accuracy compared with other machine learning classifiers. Finally, we used the learned LSTM model weights to select the top brain regions that contributed to model prediction and performed FC analyses to characterize functional changes with disease stage and motor impairment to gain better insight into the brain mechanisms of PD.",

    "abstract": "The ecological validity of performance-based cognitive screeners needs to be tested in order for them to be fully recommended for use within clinical practice and research.\nThe objective of this study was to examine, within an Italian cohort of non-demented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, the ecological validity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) by assessing its association with (1) functional independence (FI), (2) quality of life (QoL), and (3) behavioural-psychological (BP) outcomes.\nSeventy-four non-demented PD patients were administered the MoCA and underwent motor functional - i.e., Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Modified Hoehn-Yahr Scale (HY), and Schwab and England Scale (SES) -, behavioural and psychological - i.e., State- and Trait-Anxiety Inventory-Form Y (STAI-Y1/-Y2), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) - and QoL evaluations - i.e., MOS 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Associations of interest against FI, QoL, and BP outcomes were tested via Bonferroni-corrected Pearson's/Spearman's correlations while covarying for demographics, disease duration as well as UPDRS-III, UPDRS-IV, and HY scores. Intake of psychotropic drugs was also covaried when assessing the association between the MoCA and BP/QoL measures.\nMoCA scores were significantly associated with the SES (rs(73) = 0.34; p = 0.005) and the DAS-Executive (r(67) = -0.47; p &lt; 0.001), while not to other FI/BP outcomes and QoL measures.\nThe MoCA is a valid estimate of daily life functional autonomy in non-demented PD patients, also reflecting apathetic features of a dysexecutive nature.",

    "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites regulate various biological processes, such as mitochondrial dynamics, calcium homeostasis, autophagy and lipid metabolism. Notably, dysfunctions in these contact sites are closely related to neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, details about the role of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites in neurodegenerative diseases remain unknown. In Parkinson's disease, interactions between \u03b1-synuclein in the contact sites and components of tether complexes that connect organelles can lead to various dysfunctions, especially with regards to calcium homeostasis. This review will summarize the main tether complexes present in endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites, and their roles in calcium homeostasis and trafficking. We will discuss the impact of \u03b1-synuclein accumulation, its interaction with tethering complex components and the implications in Parkinson's disease pathology.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that mainly affects the aged population. Transcranial magnetic field (MF) stimulation has shown to provide temporary motor recovery in neurological disorders.\nThe aim of this study was to understand the cellular and molecular mechanism of low-intensity MF stimulation (17.96 \u00b5T; 50Hz; 2 h/day, four weeks) in a rat model of severe PD.\nA clinically relevant, bilateral striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rat model of severe PD was employed to test the efficacy of low-intensity MF stimulation in the management of motor symptoms. The mechanism of action of MF was dissected by assessing the microglial activation, tissue ultrastructure, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolomics using microdialysis.\nWe observed a significant improvement in the postural balance and gait after MF exposure with a significant reduction in the number of activated microglia. There was an improvement in striatal dopaminergic innervation and glutamate levels but it did not reach a level of statistical significance.\nMF stimulation helped ameliorate the motor deficits and reduced inflammation but was unable to provide a significant change in terms of dopaminergic innervation and metabolic profile in the severe 6-OHDA PD rat model.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) results from the destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of natural antioxidants such as caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) to maintain these neurons.\nCAPE is one of the main ingredients of propolis. Intranasal administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-2;3;4;6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was used to generate a PD model in rats. A total of 2\u00d7bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) were injected from the tail vein. Behavioral tests, immunohistochemistry, DiI, cresyl fast violet, and TUNEL staining were used to evaluate the rats 2 weeks after treatment.\nIn all treatment groups with stem cells, the DiI staining method revealed that the cells migrated to the substantia nigra pars compacta after injection. Treatment with CAPE significantly protects dopaminergic neurons from MPTP. The highest number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neurons was seen in the pre-CAPE+PD+stem cell (administration of CAPE, then the creation of PD, finally injection of stem cells) group. The number of TH+cells in all groups that received CAPE was significant compared to groups that received the stem cells only (P<0.001). Intranasal administration of MPTP significantly increases the number of apoptotic cells. The lowest number of apoptotic cells was in the CAPE+PD+stem cell group.\nThe results showed that the use of CAPE and stem cells in Parkinson rats caused a significant reduction in the apoptotic cells.",

    "results": "In all treatment groups with stem cells, the DiI staining method revealed that the cells migrated to the substantia nigra pars compacta after injection. Treatment with CAPE significantly protects dopaminergic neurons from MPTP. The highest number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neurons was seen in the pre-CAPE+PD+stem cell (administration of CAPE, then the creation of PD, finally injection of stem cells) group. The number of TH+cells in all groups that received CAPE was significant compared to groups that received the stem cells only (P<0.001). Intranasal administration of MPTP significantly increases the number of apoptotic cells. The lowest number of apoptotic cells was in the CAPE+PD+stem cell group.",

    "abstract": "Appropriate information about the ability of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) to perform cognitive instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) is necessary. The present study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Penn Parkinson daily activities questionnaire-15 (PDAQ-15).\nA total of 165 knowledgeable informants of PD patients completed the PDAQ-15. The clinical dementia rating scale, Hoehn and Yahr staging, hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and Lawton IADL scale were used in the study. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were evaluated by the Cronbach \u03b1 coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), respectively. To examine the dimensionality of the questionnaire, exploratory factor analysis was used. The construct validity was assessed using the Spearman rank correlation test. To assess the discriminative validity, PDAQ-15 scores were compared across cognitive stages.\nThe PDAQ-15 showed strong internal consistency (the Cronbach \u03b1=0.99) and test-retest reliability (ICC= 0.99). Only one dimension was identified for the PDAQ-15 in the factor analysis. There was a strong correlation between PDAQ-15 with the depression domain of the HADS scale and the Lawton IADL scale (rs=|0.71-0.95|). The correlation of PDAQ-15 with the anxiety domain of the HADS scale was moderate (rs=0.66). Discriminative validity analysis showed that the PDAQ-15 has significant power to discriminate between PD patients across cognitive stages.\nThese results suggest that the PDAQ-15 is a valid and reliable PD-specific instrument and can be useful in clinical and research settings.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor efficiency which is also required for voice production. Voice is part of the identity of a person, any abnormality in voice quality hampers the quality of communication, and quality of life. This study aimed to analyse the voice of individuals with Parkinson's disease objectively through acoustic analysis, and subjectively through perceptual analysis. Quasi-experimental study conducted in a tertiary health care centre. The study comprised two groups: 12 individuals with Parkinson's disease (11 males and 1 female, mean age: 72.41\u00a0years), and 12 healthy controls (10 males and 2 females, mean age: 53.83\u00a0years). The voice samples of all the participants were recorded and analyzed using the MDVP software of CSL 4500. The voice samples were analyzed for eleven acoustical parameters, and the perceptual analysis was carried out using the GRBAS scale by two experienced Speech Language Pathologists. Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare the two groups of participants, and Cronbach's alpha test was performed to find the inter-judge reliability between the perceptual ratings of two listeners. Acoustical comparison showed significant variations in seven parameters (jitter, shimmer, PPQ, APQ, Fatr Hz, Fftr, ATRI), and the perceptual analysis between two listeners showed a fair amount of reliability.",

    "abstract": "How mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is instantiated in dynamically interacting and spatially distributed functional brain networks remains an unexplored mystery in early Parkinson's disease (PD). We applied a machine-learning technology based on personalized sliding-window algorithm to track continuously time-varying and overlapping subnetworks under the functional brain networks calculated form resting state electroencephalogram data within a sample of 33 early PD patients (13 early PD patients with MCI and 20 early PD patients without MCI). We decoded a set of subnetworks that captured surprisingly dynamically varying and integrated interactions among certain brain lobes. We observed that the master expressed subnetworks were particularly transient, and flexibly switching between high and low expression during integration into a dynamic brain network. This transience was particularly salient in a subnetwork predominantly linking temporal-parietal-occipital lobes, which decreases in both expression and flexibility in early PD patients with MCI and expresses their degree of cognitive impairment. Moreover, MCI induced a regularly interrupted, slow evolution of subnetworks in functional brain network dynamics in early PD at the individual level, and the dynamic expression characteristics of subnetworks also reflected the degree of cognitive impairment in patients with early PD. Collectively, these results provide novel and deeper insights regarding MCI-induced abnormal dynamical interaction and large-scale changes in functional brain network of early PD.",

    "abstract": "The innate immune response mounts a defense against foreign invaders and declines with age. An inappropriate induction of this response can cause diseases. Previous studies showed that mitochondria can be repurposed to promote inflammatory signaling. Damaged mitochondria can also trigger inflammation and promote diseases. Mutations in pink1, a gene required for mitochondrial health, cause Parkinson's disease, and Drosophila melanogaster pink1 mutants accumulate damaged mitochondria. Here, we show that defective mitochondria in pink1 mutants activate Relish targets and demonstrate that inflammatory signaling causes age-dependent intestinal dysfunction in pink1-mutant flies. These effects result in the death of intestinal cells, metabolic reprogramming and neurotoxicity. We found that Relish signaling is activated downstream of a pathway stimulated by cytosolic DNA. Suppression of Relish in the intestinal midgut of pink1-mutant flies restores mitochondrial function and is neuroprotective. We thus conclude that gut-brain communication modulates neurotoxicity in a fly model of Parkinson's disease through a mechanism involving mitochondrial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Today, Parkinson's disease (PD) is the foremost neurological disorder all across the globe. In the quest for a novel therapeutic agent for PD with a multimodal mechanism of action and relatively better safety profile, natural flavonoids are now receiving greater attention as a potential source of neuroprotection. Vitexin have been shown to exhibit diverse biological benefits in various disease conditions, including PD. It exerts its anti-oxidative property in PD patients by either directly scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) or by upregulating the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Also, vitexin activates the ERK1/1 and phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pro-survival signalling pathway, which upregulates the release of anti-apoptotic proteins and downregulates the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins. It could be antagonistic to protein misfolding and aggregation. Studies have shown that it can also act as an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) enzyme, thereby increasing striatal dopamine levels, and hence, restoring the behavioural deficit in experimental PD models. Such promising pharmacological potential of vitexin could be a game-changer in devising novel therapeutic strategies against PD. This review discusses the chemistry, properties, sources, bioavailability and safety profile of vitexin. The possible molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective action of vitexin in the pathogenesis of PD alongside its therapeutic potential is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Long-term use of dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with reduction in efficacy and disabling dyskinesias. The current medical or surgical treatment modalities are ineffective for atypical parkinsonism syndromes. Hence, there is a need for holistic and cost-effective non-pharmacological interventions that act via multiple mechanisms to improve motor as well as non-motor symptoms among PD patients. Rehabilitation strategies focusing on multiple mechanisms can lead to improvement in certain symptoms among PD patients, which may be refractory to medical and surgical therapy. However, there is scanty literature available on the role of various rehabilitation strategies in patients with atypical parkinsonism patients. Multiple rehabilitation strategies such physiotherapy, aerobic exercises, strength/resistance exercises, treadmill training, cueing, dance and music, speech language therapy, occupational therapy, hydrotherapy, and martial arts have been found to improve motor as well as non-motor symptoms among PD patients. Newer modalities such as virtual-reality-based devices, exergaming, wearable sensors, and robotic prosthetic devices may be exciting future prospects in rehabilitation among patients with PD and atypical parkinsonian syndromes. This narrative review assessed and summarized the current evidence regarding the role of various rehabilitation strategies in PD and atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Furthermore, evidence regarding recent advancements in rehabilitation for patients with parkinsonism was highlighted. Despite the beneficial effect of rehabilitation in PD, there is still scanty literature available from India on rehabilitation strategies among PD patients. Larger prospective randomized control trials from India and other low- and middle-income countries, focusing on various rehabilitation strategies among PD patients, are an unmet need.",

    "abstract": "Gait training may lead to functional brain changes in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, there is a lack of studies investigating structural brain changes after gait training in PD.\nTo investigate structural brain changes induced by 4 weeks of gait training in individuals with PD.\nDiffusion tensor imaging and structural T1 images were acquired in PD group before and after robot-assisted gait training or treadmill training, and in healthy control group. Tract-based spatial statistics and tensor-based morphometry were conducted to analyze the data. The outcome of gait training was assessed by gait speed and dual-task interference of cognitive or physical tests of the 10-meter walking test representing gait automaticity. The associations between structural brain changes and these outcomes were investigated using correlation analysis.\nA total of 31 individuals with PD (68.5\u00b18.7 years, the Hoehn & Yahr stage of 2.5 or 3) and 28 healthy controls (66.6\u00b18.8 years) participated in this study. Compared to the controls, PD group at baseline showed a significant increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right forceps minor and bilateral brainstem and reduced radial diffusivity (RD) in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus, as well as the expanded structural volumes in the several brain areas. After gait training, FA increased in the left internal capsule and it decreased in the left cerebellum Crus I, while the structural volume did not change. The increased FA in the left internal capsule positively correlated with the baseline gait speed and negatively correlated with gait speed improvement; moreover, the decreased FA in the left cerebellum Crus I negatively correlated with the baseline gait speed during the cognitive task.\nGait training induces white matter changes in the brain of individuals with PD, which suggests the improvement of brain structural pathology to mitigate the impact of neurodegenerative consequences.",

    "abstract": "Natural history and disease progression in patients with Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD) is quite heterogeneous. Autonomic dysfunction occurs commonly among Idiopathic PD patients. Heart rate variability and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring are used to assess cardiac autonomic dysfunction. The prevalence and magnitude of supine hypertension in Indian PD patients has not been studied to date. The present study aimed to record cardiovascular autonomic functions and supine hypertension in PD patients and to correlate them with the age of onset, duration and severity of the disease, and non-motor symptom burden.\nThe cross-sectional study involved 60 PD patients. Webster rating scale was used to determine the disease severity. Non-motor symptom burden was assessed using the Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS). Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and heart rate variability parameters determined cardiac autonomic function. Supine hypertension was defined as Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) \u2265150 mmHg and/or DBP \u226590 mmHg. Less than 10% decrease or even increase in blood pressure during the night were classified as non-dippers. Pearson coefficient was used appropriately to establish correlation. \nAge of onset was 61.2 \u00b1 8.7 years and duration of disease was 1.7 \u00b1 1.1 years. Mean Webster and non-motor symptom scores were 12.7 \u00b1 4.4 and 15.5 \u00b1 8.0, respectively. About 50 patients (83%) were non-dipper, while 32 (53%) had supine hypertension. Low Frequency oscillations (LF) (r = 0.28), High Frequency oscillations (HF) (r = 0.29), Standard Deviation NN intervals (SDNN) (0.26), and Root Mean Squared Successive Differences of NN intervals (RMSSD) (r = 0.28) correlated significantly with non-motor symptoms scale. LF (r = -0.39), HF (r = -0.43), SDNN (-0.40), RMSSD (r = -0.41), NN50 (r = -0.38), PNN50 (r = -0.42), mean SBP (r = 0.26), and mean DBP (r = 0.33) correlated significantly with disease duration. PNN50 (r = -0.255), mean SBP (r = -0.29), and mean DBP (r = -0.27) correlated significantly with age at onset.\nAwareness regarding neurogenic supine hypertension is needed as it occurs commonly among Indian PD patients. Heart rate variability (HRV) parameters and ambulatory blood pressure are of significant help in the detection of early cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and correlate significantly with disease duration and non-motor symptom burden among PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) are often overlooked and thus can impede clinical management and significantly reduce the patient's quality of life.\nThe study aimed to determine the burden of NMS in the early stages of PD.\nA 1-year observational cross-sectional study was conducted at Mayo Hospital, Lahore, in 2019. The MDS-PD criteria were used to diagnose PD patients. The study included patients with Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stages 1-3. The frequency of NMSs was assessed using a non-motor symptom questionnaire (NMSQ), and the non-motor symptom scale (NMSS) score was derived using the NMSS.\nA total of 100 PD patients were enrolled in the study. Sixty-three (63%) were males and 37 (37%) were females. Their age ranged between 45 and 75 years with a mean \u00b1 SD of 57.46 \u00b1 8.46. At least one NMS was reported by 84% of patients, with neuropsychiatric symptoms (68%) preponderant, followed by a change in taste and smell (64%).

    "abstract": "Freezing of Gait (FOG) is among the most debilitating symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD), characterized by a sudden inability to generate effective stepping. In preparation for the development of a real-time FOG prediction and intervention device, this work presents a novel FOG prediction algorithm based on detection of altered interlimb coordination of the legs, as measured using two inertial movement sensors and analyzed using a wavelet coherence algorithm.\nFourteen participants with PD (in OFF state) were asked to walk in challenging conditions (e.g. with turning, dual-task walking, etc.) while wearing inertial motion sensors (waist, 2 shanks) and being videotaped. Occasionally, participants were asked to voluntarily stop (VOL). FOG and VOL events were identified by trained researchers based on videos. Wavelet analysis was performed on shank sagittal velocity signals and a synchronization loss threshold (SLT) was defined and compared between FOG and VOL. A proof-of-concept analysis was performed for a subset of the data to obtain preliminary classification characteristics of the novel measure.\n128 FOG and 42 VOL episodes were analyzed. SLT occurred earlier for FOG (MED=1.81 sec prior to stop, IQR=1.57) than for VOL events (MED=0.22 sec, IQR=0.76) (Z=-4.3, p<0.001, ES=1.15). These time differences were not related with measures of disease severity. Preliminary results demonstrate sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 42% (mostly due to 'turns' detection) and balanced accuracy of 70% for SLT-based prediction, with good differentiation between FOG and VOL.\nWavelet analysis provides a relatively simple, promising approach for prediction of FOG in people with PD.",

    "abstract": "Variations in brain activity patterns reveal impairments of motor and cognitive functions in the human brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG) microstates embody brain activity patterns at a microscopic time scale. However, current microstate analysis method can only recognize less than 90% of EEG signals per subject, which severely limits the characterization of dynamic brain activity. As an application to early Parkinson's disease (PD), we propose an enhanced EEG microstate recognition framework based on deep neural networks, which yields recognition rates from 90% to 99%, as accompanied by a strong anti-artifact property. Additionally, gradient-weighted class activation mapping, as a visualization technique, is employed to locate the activated functional brain regions of each microstate class. We find that each microstate class corresponds to a particular activated brain region. Finally, based on the improved identification of microstate sequences, we explore the EEG microstate characteristics and their clinical associations. We show that the decreased occurrences of a particular microstate class reflect the degree of cognitive decline in early PD, and reduced transitions between certain microstates suggest injury in motor-related brain regions. The novel EEG microstate recognition framework paves the way to revealing more effective biomarkers for early PD.",

    "abstract": "The E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin plays neuroprotective functions in the brain and the deficits of parkin's ligase function in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with reduced survival of dopaminergic neurons. Thus, compounds enhancing parkin expression have been developed as potential neuroprotective agents that prevent ongoing neurodegeneration in PD environments. Besides, iron chelators have been shown to have neuroprotective effects in diverse neurological disorders including PD. Although repression of iron accumulation and oxidative stress in brains has been implicated in their marked neuroprotective potential, molecular mechanisms of iron chelator's neuroprotective function are largely unexplored. Here, we show that the iron chelator deferasirox provides cytoprotection against oxidative stress through enhancing parkin expression under basal conditions. Parkin expression is required for cytoprotection against oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells with deferasirox treatment as confirmed by abolished deferasirox's cytoprotective effect after parkin knockdown by shRNA. Similar to the previously reported parkin inducing compound diaminodiphenyl sulfone, deferasirox-mediated parkin expression was induced by activation of the PERK-ATF4 pathway, which is associated with and stimulated by mild endoplasmic reticulum stress. The translational potential of deferasirox for PD treatment was further evaluated in cultured mouse dopaminergic neurons. There was a robust ATF4 activation and parkin expression in response to deferasirox treatment in dopaminergic neurons under basal conditions. Consequently, the enhanced parkin expression by deferasirox provided substantial neuroprotection against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced oxidative stress. Taken together, our study results revealed a novel mechanism through which an iron chelator, deferasirox induces neuroprotection. Since parkin function in the brain is compromised in PD and during aging, maintenance of parkin expression through the iron chelator treatment could be beneficial by increasing dopaminergic neuronal survival.",

    "abstract": "Differential diagnosis between idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) associated with parkinsonism (iNPH-P) and Parkinson's disease (PD) may prove difficult when evaluating patients with early parkinsonism. The objective of this study was to evaluate differences in mobility during standardized tasks between iNPH-P and PD.\nWe selected 21 iNPH-P and 21 pharmacologically untreated PD patients. They all performed the instrumented Timed Up and Go test at the time of diagnosis.\nTurning tasks showed longer duration and lower speed in iNPH-P than in PD. Vertical variation in acceleration during the sit-to-stand phase was lower in iNPH-P patients, whereas the duration of the stand-to-sit phase was longer. On walking, iNPH-P showed smaller stride length and a longer gait cycle duration. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age and cognitive status as potential confounders, average angular speed on turning before sitting was the discriminating parameter between the two groups.\nPatients with iNPH-P showed specific abnormal mobility performances with respect to untreated PD, specifically during the turning-to-sitting transition.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in technology, clinical phenotyping of Parkinson's disease (PD) has remained relatively limited as current assessments are mainly based on empirical observation and subjective categorical judgment at the clinic. A lack of comprehensive, objective, and quantifiable clinical phenotyping data has hindered our capacity to diagnose, assess patients' conditions, discover pathogenesis, identify preclinical stages and clinical subtypes, and evaluate new therapies. Therefore, deep clinical phenotyping of PD patients is a necessary step towards understanding PD pathology and improving clinical care. In this review, we present a growing community consensus and perspective on how to clinically phenotype this disease, that is, to phenotype the entire course of disease progression by integrating capacity, performance, and perception approaches with state-of-the-art technology. We also explore the most studied aspects of PD deep clinical phenotypes, namely, bradykinesia, tremor, dyskinesia and motor fluctuation, gait impairment, speech impairment, and non-motor phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multi-systemic neurodegenerative brain disorder. Motor symptoms of PD are linked to the significant dopamine (DA) loss in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) followed by basal ganglia (BG) circuit dysfunction. Increasing experimental and computational evidence indicates that (synaptic) plasticity plays a key role in the emergence of PD-related pathological changes following DA loss. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mediated by DA provides a mechanistic model for synaptic plasticity to modify synaptic connections within the BG according to the neuronal activity. To shed light on how DA-mediated STDP can shape neuronal activity and synaptic connectivity in the PD condition, we reviewed experimental and computational findings addressing the modulatory effect of DA on STDP as well as other plasticity mechanisms and discussed their potential role in PD pathophysiology and related network dynamics and connectivity. In particular, reshaping of STDP profiles together with other plasticity-mediated processes following DA loss may abnormally modify synaptic connections in competing pathways of the BG. The cascade of plasticity-induced maladaptive or compensatory changes can impair the excitation-inhibition balance towards the BG output nuclei, leading to the emergence of pathological activity-connectivity patterns in PD. Pre-clinical, clinical as well as computational studies reviewed here provide an understanding of the impact of synaptic plasticity and other plasticity mechanisms on PD pathophysiology, especially PD-related network activity and connectivity, after DA loss. This review may provide further insights into the abnormal structure-function relationship within the BG contributing to the emergence of pathological states in PD. Specifically, this review is intended to provide detailed information for the development of computational network models for PD, serving as testbeds for the development and optimization of invasive and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques. Computationally derived hypotheses may accelerate the development of therapeutic stimulation techniques and potentially reduce the number of related animal experiments.",

    "abstract": "Circulating zinc (Zn) concentrations are lower than normal in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). It is unknown whether Zn deficiency increases the susceptibility to PD.\nThe study aimed to investigate the effect of dietary Zn deficiency on behaviors and dopaminergic neurons in a mouse model of PD and to explore potential mechanisms.\nMale C57BL/6J mice aged 8-10 wk were fed Zn adequate (ZnA; 30 \u03bcg/g) or Zn deficient (ZnD; <5 \u03bcg/g) diet throughout the experiments. Six weeks later 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was injected to generate the PD model. Controls were injected with saline. Thus, 4 groups (Saline-ZnA, Saline-ZnD, MPTP-ZnA, and MPTP-ZnD) were formed. The experiment lasted 13 wk. Open field test, rotarod test, immunohistochemistry, and RNA sequencing were performed. Data were analyzed with t-test, 2-factor ANOVA, or Kruskal-Wallis test.\nBoth MPTP and ZnD diet treatments led to a significant reduction in blood Zn concentrations (P\nZn deficiency aggravates movement disorders in PD mice. Our results support previous clinical observations and suggest that appropriate Zn supplementation may be beneficial for PD.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Sialorrhea Clinical Scale for Parkinson's disease (SCS-PD) for use in clinical settings.\nThe original English version of SCS-PD has been adapted to Turkish (SCS-TR) in accordance with international guidelines. Forty-one patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and 31 healthy people were included in our study. SCS-TR, Movement Disorders Society United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part II (functional subscale 2.2 Saliva and drooling), Drooling Frequency and Severity Scale (DFSS) and The Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQ) (1st question evaluating saliva) were applied to both groups. The adapted scale was re-tested in PD patients 2 weeks later.\nA statistically significant relationship was determined between the SCS-TR scale score and all similar scale scores (NMSQ, MDS-UPDRS, DFSS) (p<0.001). The correlation between SCS-TR and similar scales scores was high, linear and positive (84.8% for MDS-UPDRS, 72.3% for DFSS and 70.1% for NMSQ). The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the evaluation of the reliability of the sialorrhea clinical scale questionnaire was found to be 0.881 which indicates a very good internal consistency. Spearman's correlation test evaluating the relationship between the scores of the preliminary test and re-test of SCS-TR showed a high level, linear and positive relationship.\nSCS-TR is consistent with the original version of SCS-PD. As its validity and reliability in Turkey have been shown by our study, it can be used for the evaluation of sialorrhea in Turkish PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) lacks a definitive diagnosis due to a lack of pathological validation of patients at antemortem. The risk of misdiagnosis is high in the early stages of PD, often eluded by atypical parkinsonian symptoms. Neuroimaging and laboratory biomarkers are being sought to aid in the clinical diagnosis of PD. Nigrosome imaging and neuromelanin (NM)-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the new emerging tools, both technically simple plus cost-effective for studying nigral pathology, and have shown potential for authenticating the clinical diagnosis of PD. Visual assessment of the nigrosome-1 appearance, at 3 or 7 Tesla, yields excellent diagnostic accuracy for differentiating idiopathic PD from healthy controls. Moreover, midbrain atrophy and putaminal hypointensity in nigrosome-1 imaging are valid pointers in distinguishing PD from allied parkinsonian disorders. The majority of studies employed T2 and susceptibility-weighted imaging MRI sequences to visualize nigrosome abnormalities, whereas T1-weighted fast-spin echo sequences were used for NM imaging. The diagnostic performance of NM-sensitive MRI in discriminating PD from normal HC can be improved further. Longitudinal studies with adequate sampling of varied uncertain PD cases should be designed to accurately evaluate the sensitivity and diagnostic potential of nigrosome and NM imaging techniques. Equal weightage is to be given to uniformity and standardization of protocols, data analysis, and interpretation of results. There is tremendous scope for identifying disease-specific structural changes in varied forms of parkinsonism with these low-cost imaging tools. Nigrosome-1 and midbrain NM imaging may not only provide an accurate diagnosis of PD but could mature into tools for personally tailored treatment and prognosis.",

    "abstract": "There is a dearth of studies on non-motor symptoms of Wilson's disease (WD) which is primarily because of the non-availability of a suitable scale.\nTo assess the suitability of the Parkinson's Disease non motor symptoms questionnaire (PD-NMS Quest) in the assessment of non-motor symptoms of WD patients.\nIn this case-control study, patients of WD above \u226512 years of age diagnosed by Leipzig's criteria and age and gender-matched control subjects were recruited. Critically ill patients, patients with severe hepatic impairment, or with pure hepatic WD were excluded. PD-NMS Quest was applied and relevant statistical analyses were performed.\nA total of 18 cases and 25 controls were studied. Patients had a mean age of 22.6 years and a median disease duration of 8 years. WD patients had higher frequencies of all NMS than controls.

    "abstract": "A lesser studied aspect of Parkinson's disease (PD) is its associated peripheral sensory-motor neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy is an intriguing aspect of PD, a problem not given sufficient attention and which if tackled properly could make a difference to the multifaceted sufferings of the PD patient. Studies regarding the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy and its risk factors in patients with PD are scarce from the Indian subcontinent.\nThis prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital in South India. Patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) were screened and enrolled. All the patients underwent detailed evaluation of symptoms, signs, and electrophysiology (Nerve conduction study, Sympathetic skin response), stimulated skin wrinkling with Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics. Patients found to have large/small fiber neuropathy underwent additional tests to exclude other causes of neuropathy.\nA total of 154 patients with IPD were enrolled in the study (mean age: 61.96 \u00b1 9.15 years, mean duration of disease was 4.08 \u00b1 3.16 years). The mean Hoehn and Yahr (H and Y) score was 2.3 \u00b1 0.825 and the mean Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-3 score in the ON state was 23.07 \u00b1 11.14. The mean cumulative levodopa dose was 482.68 \u00b1 651.76 (median: 292; range: 4728.57) grams. Peripheral neuropathy was found in 49 patients (31.8%), large fiber in 28 (18.2%) and small fiber in 47 (30.5%); an overlap of large and small fiber neuropathy was seen in 26 patients (16.9%). Around 34% of patients had serum homocysteine levels >20 mg/dl. In univariate analysis, duration of disease, levodopa cumulative dose, serum homocysteine level, H and Y score, UPDRS-3 ON score, Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score (\nIn our cohort, majority of the patients were in early-stage PD and around one-fifth and one-third of patients suffer from large and small fiber polyneuropathy, respectively. Large and small fiber neuropathy in PD is mainly associated with duration of disease, levodopa cumulative dose, and H and Y score.",

The current study aims at recognizing its neuropsychiatric symptoms, its impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the patients, and the caregiver burden in a middle- to-low-income country.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional survey of 73 idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients and their caregivers from January 2021 to June 2021. Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-12) and Parkinson's disease questionnaire (PDQ-39) were used to assess patients' symptoms and HRQOL, respectively. We used the Zarit caregiver burden interview (ZBI) and Hamilton depression scale (Ham-D) for the caregiver's burden assessment.\nOf the 73 patients, 43 (59%) were men, and 30 (41%) were women. Their mean age was 60.25 years (\u00b1 11.1), and the mean duration of PD was 6.4 years (\u00b1 3.4). Eighty-six percent of the patients reported having one or more neuropsychiatric symptoms.

    "abstract": "Epidemiological and animal studies indicate that pre-existing diabetes increases the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. In the present study, we found that high glucose (HG) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of diabetic rats might enhance the effect of a subthreshold dose of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) on the development of motor disorders, and the damage to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal pathway. In vitro, HG promoted the 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis in PC12\u00a0cells differentiated to neurons with nerve growth factor (NGF) (NGF-PC12). Metabolomics showed that HG promoted hyperglycolysis in neurons and impaired tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) activity, which was closely related to abnormal mitochondrial fusion, thus resulting in mitochondrial loss. Interestingly, HG-induced upregulation of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) combined with 6-OHDA exposure not only mediated glycolysis but also promoted abnormal mitochondrial fusion by upregulating the expression of MFN2 in NGF-PC12\u00a0cells. In addition, we found that PKM2 knockdown rescued the abnormal mitochondrial fusion and cell apoptosis induced by HG+6-OHDA. Furthermore, we found that shikonin (SK), an inhibitor of PKM2, restored the mitochondrial number, promoted TCA cycle activity, reversed hyperglycolysis, enhanced the tolerance of cultured neurons to 6-OHDA, and reduced the risk of PD in diabetic rats. Overall, our results indicate that diabetes promotes hyperglycolysis and abnormal mitochondrial fusion in neurons through the upregulation of PKM2, leading to an increase in the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to 6-OHDA. Thus, the inhibition of PKM2 and restoration of mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis/pathways may prevent the occurrence and development of diabetic PD.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson disease (PD) are at high risk for developing melanoma, although current literature lacks details on the associated clinicopathologic characteristics. Our retrospective case-control study aimed to guide skin cancer surveillance recommendations for patients with PD, focusing on tumor sites. Our study included 70 adults with concurrent diagnoses of PD and melanoma from January 1, 2007 to January 1, 2020 at Duke University and 102 age-, sex-, and race-matched controls. The head/neck region accounted for 39.5% of invasive melanomas in the case group compared with 25.3% in the control group as well as 48.7% of noninvasive melanomas in the case group compared with 39.1% in the control group. Of note, 50% of metastatic melanomas in patients with PD originated on the head and neck (n\u00a0= 3). Logistic regression showed 2.09 times higher odds of having a head/neck melanoma in our case group compared with that in the control group (OR\u00a0= 2.09, 95% confidence interval\u00a0= 1.13\u20123.86; ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex disorder that leads to alterations in multiple neurotransmitter systems, notably glutamate. As such, several drugs acting at glutamatergic receptors have been assessed to alleviate the manifestation of PD and treatment-related complications, culminating with the approval of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist amantadine for l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia. Glutamate elicits its actions through several ionotropic and metabotropic (mGlu) receptors. There are 8 sub-types of mGlu receptors, with sub-types 4 (mGlu",

T2* gradient echo (T2* GRE), susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) are susceptibility MR imaging sequences that provide more information about brain iron levels than other conventional MR imaging.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic power of putaminal hypointensity on T2* GRE, SWI, and QSM in distinguishing PSP from IPD.\nEligible studies were identified via systematic searches of PubMed and Clarivate Analytics\u00ae Web of Science\u00ae Core Collection. Studies that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed. A meta-analysis was conducted using the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve approach.\nOur literature search of the two databases yielded 562 primary articles, 10 of which were deemed relevant and only six were eligible for further analyses. We performed a meta-analysis of putaminal hypointensity measurements: 438 patients with IPD and 109 patients with PSP were enrolled in the quantitative synthesis. The meta-analysis of six studies with 547 patients revealed a sensitivity of 69% (95% confidence interval (CI): 33%-90%) and specificity of 91% (95% CI: 80%-96%) for putaminal hypointensity on T2* GRE, SWI, or QSM distinguishing PSP from IPD.\nPutaminal hypointensity on T2* GRE, SWI, or QSM is able to distinguish patients with PSP from those with IPD with high specificity.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with substantial costs which increase with progression state. However, few studies have investigated the association between costs and health related quality of life.\nTo estimate the relationship between costs and health related quality of life, measured by the Parkinson's disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ)-8 from a societal perspective, partial societal perspective (excluding productivity loss), and a health care perspective.\nThe Swedish Parkinson's Disease registry was linked to health care data registries to estimate annual costs. A generalized linear model was used to assess the relationship between instrument items and costs.\nThe results suggest that PDQ-8 captures the increase of costs by PD severity, particularly for costs within the broader societal perspective. From the best to worst PDQ-8 quartile, we observed approximately 7-fold increases within the societal perspective (39,400 to 274,300 SEK) and the partial societal perspective (31,800 to 219,400 SEK), and the increase within the health care perspective more than doubled (21,900 to 49,700 SEK). The PDQ-8 dimensions \"mobility,\" \"activities of daily living\" and \"social support\" were associated with high costs in all perspectives.\nUsing a disease-specific measure reflecting the patient's perspective, we found an increase of costs with worsening severity of PD, particularly for costs within the broader societal perspective. High costs were associated with not only motor symptoms, but also the dimension \"Social support.\"",

Via digital video analysis software, we previously found reduced facial movement (entropy) and slower time to reach peak entropy in individuals with Parkinson's disease compared to controls.\nWe aimed to determine whether levodopa medications improved parameters of dynamic facial expressions (amplitude, speed).\nA total of 34 individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were videotaped making voluntary facial expressions (happy, fear, anger, disgust) when \"on\" and \"off\" levodopa. Participants were 52 to 80\u2009years old, early to mid-stage disease, non-demented, and included more men (65%). Expressions were digitized and analyzed using software that extracted three variables: two indices of movement change (total entropy, percent entropy change) and time to reach peak expression.\nIndices of facial movement (total entropy, peak entropy) and timing were significantly improved when patients were \"on\" vs \"off\" medication (all \nThe effects of levodopa on Parkinson's disease voluntary facial movement and on timing were robust and consistent with those of levodopa on other intentional movements in Parkinson's disease.

    "abstract": "Behaviors interfering with medication adherence (MA) are common and often complex in Parkinson's disease (PD), negatively affecting quality of life and undermining the value of clinical trials. The Clinical Outcome Assessments (COA) Scientific Evaluation Committee of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) commissioned the assessment of MA rating scales to recommend the use in PD.\nCritically review the measurement properties of rating scales used to assess MA in PD and to issue recommendations.\nWe conducted systematic review across seven databases to identify structured scales to assess MA in PD. Eligible studies were critically appraised for methodological quality using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) Risk of Bias checklist. Standards for good measurement properties of the selected scales were summarized narratively using the COSMIN, the MDS-COA Committee methodology, the World Health Organization concepts, and the Ascertaining Barriers to Compliance taxonomy. The certainty of the evidence was determined using the modified Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach with final assessments (highest to lowest) of \"Recommended,\" \"Suggested\" and \"Listed\".\nOf the nine reviewed scales, none met the designation \"Recommended\". The Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8); Beliefs Related to Medications Adherence questionnaire, Beliefs about Medication Questionnaire, Medication Adherence Rating Scale, and Satisfaction with Information on Medicines Scale were rated \"Suggested\".\nWe suggest further work focusing on resolving the problems of the suggested scales or developing a new scale meeting all required criteria.",

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Circumstances and consequences of falls presented by single and recurrent fallers were compared.\nA total of 805 falls were analyzed, 107 (13%) were falls with injuries. Multivariate logistic regression model revealed that greater PD duration and higher balance confidence were protective factors; better balance during gait, outdoor falls, and falls related to extrinsic factors were risk factors for falls with injuries, when compared to falls with no injuries. Multivariate multinomial regression model revealed that, when compared to zero fall, past falls and daily levodopa equivalent dose were predictors of falls with injuries; these predictors together with disability were predictors of falls with no injuries. Single falls (n\u00a0=\u00a027; 3%) were more common outdoors because of extrinsic factors, whereas recurrent falls (n\u00a0=\u00a0778; 97%) were more common indoors because of intrinsic factors. Single falls led to more injuries than recurrent falls (\nDifferent predictors of falls with injuries were obtained when different outcomes were compared.

    "abstract": "Although proven very efficacious as treatment for Parkinson's disease by Schwab as far back as the 1950s, and later confirmed by Cotzias and colleagues in the early 1970s, use of intermittent subcutaneous injections of the dopamine agonist apomorphine remains limited worldwide.\nTo review evidence regarding use of intermittent, on-demand apomorphine as a treatment for off-period disability in Parkinson's disease.\nA PRISMA-compliant structured literature search was carried out with a focus on clinical effect (motor improvement, daily off time decrease; latency, duration), antiemetic prophylaxis, and adverse events.\nFifty-eight studies were evaluated. Apomorphine administration route was subcutaneous in 29 (50%), sublingual in 14 (24.1%), intranasal in 6 (10.3%), inhaled in 5 (8.6%), rectal in 3 (5.2%) and transdermal in 1 (1.7%). Irrespective of the route, motor disability improved 19% to 74% and daily off time decreased 3% to 68%, with subcutaneous having the fastest onset of action ranging from 6 to 24\u00a0minutes and lasting 28 to 96\u00a0minutes. Antiemetic prophylaxis was used in almost all studies. Systemic side effects like nausea and yawning were mild and well tolerated, but sedation led to discontinuation of subcutaneous apomorphine in 5.5%. Local side effects to subcutaneous administration did not result in discontinuation. Stomatitis with the early sublingual formulations led to discontinuation in nearly half of patients and was reduced to 16.7% with novel film strips.\nIntermittent subcutaneous injections remain the most reliable and safest route of apomorphine administration, with an efficacy for off period treatment supported by nearly four decades of clinical experience.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and presents a complex etiology with genomic and environmental factors and no recognized cures. Genotype data, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), could be used as a prodromal factor for early detection of PD. However, the polygenic nature of PD presents a challenge as the complex relationships between SNPs towards disease development are difficult to model. Traditional assessment methods such as polygenic risk scores and machine learning approaches struggle to capture the complex interactions present in the genotype data, thus limiting their discriminative capabilities in diagnosis. On the other hand, deep learning models are better suited for this task. Nevertheless, they encounter difficulties of their own such as a lack of interpretability. To overcome these limitations, in this work, a novel transformer encoder-based model is introduced to classify PD patients from healthy controls based on their genotype. This method is designed to effectively model complex global feature interactions and enable increased interpretability through the learned attention scores. The proposed framework outperformed traditional machine learning models and multilayer perceptron (MLP) baseline models. Moreover, visualization of the learned SNP-SNP associations provides not only interpretability to the model but also valuable insights into the biochemical pathways underlying PD development, which are corroborated by pathway enrichment analysis. Our results suggest novel SNP interactions to be further studied in wet lab and clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is generally considered as a primary movement disorder, but the majority of patients also suffer from non-motor oral, salivary symptoms. The most common salivary symptoms, sialorrhea and xerostomia, have a considerable negative impact on the quality of life. Although these symptoms are completely opposite ones, both significantly impair oral health of patients. Sialorrhea is defined as an increased amount of the retaining saliva. It is related to salivary overproduction, or it may be associated with impaired clearance of saliva. Opposed to sialorrhea, xerostomia is subjectively defined as dryness of mouth and it is related to insufficient salivary secretion. Xerostomia promotes imbalance of oral microflora and oral pathology that often leads to malnutrition in PD patients. It is mostly related to autonomic dysfunction, or it might be considered as a side effect of dopaminergic or anticholinergic medication. In PD, different assessments are used for evaluation of sialorrhea and xerostomia, including validated scales for non-motor symptoms and standardized questionnaires on oral health. Consequently, treatment of salivary symptoms includes pharmacological and nonpharmacological approach, and surgical interventions. A multidisciplinary approach in clinical neurology and dental medicine, which includes accurate evaluation of salivary symptoms and effective treatment, indicates successful management of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. In different studies, it has been investigated that boric acid has positive effects on different mechanisms that are important in PD. The aim of our study was to investigate the pharmacological, behavioral and biochemical effects of boric acid on rats with experimental PD with Rotenone. For this purpose, Wistar-albino rats were divided into 6 groups. Only normal saline was applied subcutaneously (s.c) to the first control and sunflower oil to the second control group. Rotenone was administered (s.c) to 4 groups (groups 3-6) at a dose of 2 mg/kg for 21 days. Only rotenone (2mg/kg, s.c) was administered to the third group. Boric acid was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg to groups 4, 5, and 6, respectively. During the study, behavioral tests were applied to the rats, and then histopathological and biochemical analyzes were performed from the sacrificed tissues. According to the data obtained, a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) was observed between the Parkinson's group and the other groups in motor behavior tests, excluding the catalepsy test. Boric acid exhibited dose-dependent antioxidant activity. As a result of the histopathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) examination, a decrease in neuronal degeneration was observed at the increasing doses of boric acid, while gliosis and focal encephalomalacia were rarely encountered. There was a significant increase in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity, especially in group 6, with a dose of 20 mg/kg of boric acid. From these results, we conclude that the dose-dependent effect of boric acid may protect the dopaminergic system with antioxidant activity in the pathogenesis of PD. However, the effectiveness of boric acid on PD needs further investigation in a larger, more detailed study using different methods.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Qihuang Needle (QHN) in treating Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe trial was an 8-week randomized clinical trial (4 weeks of treatment followed by 4 weeks of follow-up) conducted from January 2021 to July 2022 in outpatient settings at three clinical sites in Guangzhou, China. Thirty-four participants with PD were diagnosed based on the diagnostic criteria formulated by the brain bank of the British Parkinson's Disease Society in 1992.\nPatients in the treatment and control groups received six sessions within 4 weeks of the QHN therapy or the sham acupuncture therapy (two times per week for the first two consecutive weeks and one time per week for the following two consecutive weeks).\nThe primary outcome measure was the change in the Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Part III Motor Examination (UPDRS III) between baseline and 8 weeks after treatments. Secondary outcome measures were the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale for Parkinson's Disease (NMSS) and Parkinson's Disease Daily Quality of Life-39 (PDQ-39). Real-time shear wave elastography (SWE) was assessed for each patient at baseline and during the 4-week period as the third outcome measure.\nA more significant reduction of UPDRS III score, PDQ-39, NMSS, and SWE was observed in the QHN group than in the sham acupuncture group.\nThe QHN therapy consistently demonstrated superiority and produced clinically meaningful benefits in reducing motor and non-motor symptoms, as well as significantly improving muscle stiffness, in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), as a common neurodegenerative disease, currently has no effective therapeutic approaches to delay or stop its progression. There is an urgent need to further define its pathogenesis and develop new therapeutic targets. An increasing number of studies have shown that members of the sirtuin (SIRT) family are differentially involved in neurodegenerative diseases, indicating their potential to serve as targets in therapeutic strategies. Mitochondrial SIRT4 possesses multiple enzymatic activities, such as deacetylase, ADP ribosyltransferase, lipoamidase, and deacylase activities, and exhibits different enzymatic activities and target substrates in different tissues and cells; thus, mitochondrial SIRT4 plays an integral role in regulating metabolism. However, the role and mechanism of SIRT4 in PD are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism and possible regulatory targets of SIRT4 in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice.\nThe expression of the SIRT4 protein in the MPTP-induced PD mouse mice or key familial Parkinson disease protein 7 knockout (DJ-1 KO) rat was compared against the control group by western blot assay. Afterwards, quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify altered proteins in the vitro model and reveal the possible functional role of SIRT4. The most promising molecular target of SIRT4 were screened and validated by viral transfection, western blot assay and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays.\nThe expression of the SIRT4 protein was found to be altered both in the MPTP-induced PD mouse mice and DJ-1KO rats. Following the viral transfection of SIRT4, a quantitative proteomics analysis identified 5,094 altered proteins in the vitro model, including 213 significantly upregulated proteins and 222 significantly downregulated proteins. The results from bioinformatics analyses indicated that SIRT4 mainly affected the ribosomal pathway, propionate metabolism pathway, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway and peroxisome pathway in cells, and we screened 25 potential molecular targets. Finally, only fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) in the PPAR signaling pathway was regulated by SIRT4 among the 25 molecules. Importantly, the alterations in FABP4 and PPAR\u03b3 were verified in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model.\nOur results indicated that FABP4 in the PPAR signaling pathway is the most promising molecular target of SIRT4 in an MPTP-induced mouse model and revealed the possible functional role of SIRT4. This study provides a reference for future drug development and mechanism research with SIRT4 as a target or biomarker.",

    "results": "The expression of the SIRT4 protein was found to be altered both in the MPTP-induced PD mouse mice and DJ-1KO rats. Following the viral transfection of SIRT4, a quantitative proteomics analysis identified 5,094 altered proteins in the vitro model, including 213 significantly upregulated proteins and 222 significantly downregulated proteins. The results from bioinformatics analyses indicated that SIRT4 mainly affected the ribosomal pathway, propionate metabolism pathway, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway and peroxisome pathway in cells, and we screened 25 potential molecular targets. Finally, only fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) in the PPAR signaling pathway was regulated by SIRT4 among the 25 molecules. Importantly, the alterations in FABP4 and PPAR\u03b3 were verified in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are compulsory clinical features for the clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA), some of which precede motor symptoms onset. To date, few studies have systematically investigated NMS in MSA and the timing of presenting NMS as the disease progresses. Clinically, MSA is difficult to be differentiated from Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and the differences in NMS between MSA and PD/PSP remain unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the burden of NMS between MSA and PD/PSP and to delineate the timing of NMS presentation relative to the onset of motor symptoms in MSA.\nA total of 61, 87, and 30 patients with MSA, PD, and PSP, respectively, were enrolled in this study. NMS was systematically assessed in all patients using the NMS scale (NMSS), and the onset of NMS relative to the onset of motor symptoms in MSA was investigated.\nMSA group had higher total NMSS scores (82.15 \u00b1 46.10) than the PD (36.14 \u00b1 30.78) and PSP (50.30 \u00b1 55.05) groups (\nThe NMS spectrum in MSA differs from that of PD and PSP. Patients with MSA have a higher NMS burden than patients with PD or PSP. RBD, constipation, problems having sex, and loss of sexual interest may become early diagnostic clinical markers of MSA.",

    "abstract": "In healthy people, motor resonance mechanisms are flexible to negative emotional contextual clues with greater motor resonance during the observation of a reach to grasp movement performed in an environment eliciting disgust. The link between emotion and motor control has become an interesting topic in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we aimed to study the response of the mirror neuron system, specifically motor resonance, to an emotion-enriched context in people with PD. Corticospinal excitability was recorded in a total of 44 participants, divided into two groups (23 PD patients and 21 healthy subjects). We recorded motor-evoked potentials from a muscle involved in the grasping movement while participants were watching the same reach-to-grasp movement embedded in surrounds with negative emotional valence, but different levels of arousal: sadness (low arousal) and disgust (high arousal). Basic motor resonance mechanisms were less efficient in PD than controls. Responsiveness to emotional contextual clues eliciting sadness was similar between PD and controls, whereas responsiveness to emotional contextual clues eliciting disgust was impaired in PD patients. Our findings show reduced motor resonance flexibility to the disgusting context, supporting the hypothesis that PD patients may have a deficit in \"translating\" an aversive motivational state into a physiologic response. The amygdala, which is implicated in the appraisal of fearful stimuli and response to threatening situations, might be implicated in this process.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) are chronic neurological diseases characterized by loss and/or damage to neurons along with the myelin sheath, and patients are at higher risk of severe infection with the SARS\u2011CoV\u20112. A comprehensive literature search was performed using relevant terms and inclusion\u2011exclusion criteria. Recent articles, subjects older than 50 years, and articles written in the English language were included, whereas letters to the editor and articles related to pregnant women were excluded from the review study. COVID\u201119 appears to damage angiotensin\u2011II receptors which cause natural killer cells to lose the ability to clear virus\u2011infected cells, owing to worse outcomes in patients with NDD. COVID\u201119 can worsen the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, COVID\u201119 worsens drug\u2011responsive motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other symptoms like fatigue and urinary complaints. Vitamin D is essential in decreasing pro\u2011inflammatory and increasing anti\u2011inflammatory cytokines in ongoing COVID\u201119 infections and reducing angiotensin receptors and, hence, decreasing COVID\u201119 infection severity. Telemedicine shows promise for patients with NDD but is yet to overcome legal issues and personal barriers. COVID\u201119 has a significant effect on neurodegenerative conditions, which appears partly to the nature of the NDD and the neuro\u2011invasive capabilities of the SARS\u2011CoV\u20112. The protective role of vitamin D in patients with NDD further supports this hypothesis. Modifications in current health care, like the telemedicine platform, are required to address the increased risk of serious infection in this population. Further studies will be required to clarify conflicting reports in many fields.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic medications can trigger impulsive-compulsive behaviors (ICBs) in pre-disposed patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but what this implies on a neurocognitive level is unclear. Previous findings highlighted potentially exacerbated incentive motivation (willingness to work for rewards) and choice impulsivity (preferring smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed rewards) in PD patients with ICBs (PD + ICBs).\nTo deeply understand this evidence, we studied 24 PD + ICBs and 28 PD patients without ICBs (PD-ICBs). First of all, patients underwent the assessment of impulsivity traits, mood, anxiety, and addiction condition. We further administered robust objective and subjective measures of specific aspects of motivation. Finally, we explored whether these processes might link to any heightened antisocial behavior (aggression and risky driving) in PD + ICBs.\nHigh levels of positive urgency trait characterized PD + ICBs. They choose to exert more effort for rewards under the conditions of low and medium reward probability and as reward magnitude increases. Findings on choice impulsivity show a great tendency to delay discounting in PD + ICBs, other than a high correlation between delay and probability discounting. In addition, we found what appears to be the first evidence of heightened reactive aggression in PD patients with ICBs. Exacerbated incentive motivation and delay discounting trended toward positively predicting reactive aggression in PD + ICBs.\nOur promising results suggest that there might be immense value in future large-scale studies adopting a transdiagnostic neurocognitive endophenotype approach to understanding and predicting the addictive and aggressive behaviors that can arise from dopaminergic medication in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Although dopaminergic drugs are the mainstay for improving PD symptoms, there are still few effective disease-modifying therapies. With the increasing prevalence of PD and the rapid transition to an aging society, more emphasis needs to be placed on rehabilitation that could slow the disease progression combined with pharmacological therapy. In this review, we present an update on evidence related to rehabilitation programs for motor function, swallowing difficulty, and speech disorders in PD. Aerobic exercise, music therapy, dance, virtual reality, and non-invasive brain stimulation have been shown to improve motor function, and telerehabilitation could also be feasibly applied in PD. Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of expiratory muscle strengthening exercises and Lee Silverman Voice Treatment for swallowing difficulty and speech disorders, respectively. Although many rehabilitation programs have been tried, the evidence is still limited. Well-designed future randomized controlled trials with large numbers of participants are needed to establish evidence for rehabilitation in PD.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of studies in recent years have focused on the role that the gut may play in Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathogenesis, suggesting that the maintenance of a healthy gut may lead to potential treatments of the disease. The health of microbiota has been shown to be directly associated with parameters that play a potential role in PD including gut barrier integrity, immunity, function, metabolism and the correct functioning of the gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota (GM) may therefore be employed as valuable indicators for early diagnosis of PD and potential targets for preventing or treating PD symptoms. Preserving the gut homeostasis using probiotics may therefore lead to a promising treatment strategy due to their known benefits in improving constipation, motor impairments, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of probiotics in PD are yet to be clarified. In this project, we have tested the efficacy of an oral probiotic suspension, Symprove\u2122, on an established animal model of PD. Symprove\u2122, unlike many commercially available probiotics, has been shown to be resistant to gastric acidity, improve symptoms in gastrointestinal diseases and improve gut integrity in an ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with characteristic pathological abnormalities, including the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, a dopamine-depleted striatum, and microglial activation. Lipid accumulation exhibits a close relationship with these pathologies in PD.\nHere, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was used to construct a rat model of PD, and the lipid profile in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from model rats was analyzed using lipidomic approaches.\nEstablishment of this PD model was confirmed by apomorphine-induced rotation behaviors, loss of DA neurons, depletion of dopamine in the striatum, and microglial activation after 6-OHDA-induced lesion generation. Unsupervised and supervised methods were employed for lipid analysis. A total of 172 lipid species were identified in CSF and subsequently classified into 18 lipid families. Lipid families, including eicosanoids, triglyceride (TG), cholesterol ester (CE), and free fatty acid (FFA), and 11 lipid species exhibited significantly altered profiles 2 weeks after 6-OHDA administration, and significant changes in eicosanoids, TG, CE, CAR, and three lipid species were noted 5 weeks after 6-OHDA administration. During the period of 6-OHDA-induced lesion formation, the lipid families and species showed concentration fluctuations related to the recovery of behavior and nigrostriatal abnormalities. Correlation analysis showed that the levels of eicosanoids, CE, TG families, and TG (16:0_20:0_18:1) exhibited positive relationships with apomorphine-induced rotation behaviors and negative relationships with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the midbrain.\nThese results revealed that non-progressive nigrostriatal degeneration induced by 6-OHDA promotes the expression of an impairment-related lipidomic signature in CSF, and the level of eicosanoids, CE, TG families, and TG (16:0_20:0_18:1) in CSF may reveal pathological changes in the midbrain after 6-OHDA insult.",

    "results": "Establishment of this PD model was confirmed by apomorphine-induced rotation behaviors, loss of DA neurons, depletion of dopamine in the striatum, and microglial activation after 6-OHDA-induced lesion generation. Unsupervised and supervised methods were employed for lipid analysis. A total of 172 lipid species were identified in CSF and subsequently classified into 18 lipid families. Lipid families, including eicosanoids, triglyceride (TG), cholesterol ester (CE), and free fatty acid (FFA), and 11 lipid species exhibited significantly altered profiles 2 weeks after 6-OHDA administration, and significant changes in eicosanoids, TG, CE, CAR, and three lipid species were noted 5 weeks after 6-OHDA administration. During the period of 6-OHDA-induced lesion formation, the lipid families and species showed concentration fluctuations related to the recovery of behavior and nigrostriatal abnormalities. Correlation analysis showed that the levels of eicosanoids, CE, TG families, and TG (16:0_20:0_18:1) exhibited positive relationships with apomorphine-induced rotation behaviors and negative relationships with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the midbrain.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by dopaminergic neuronal damage. In this study, three tea extracts from Hadong, Korea, were evaluated in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity damage model (C57BL/6 mice) for their therapeutic effects against PD: green tea (GT), semi-fermented tea (SFT), and fermented tea (FT). Theaflavin content in the teas increased but catechin content decreased with the degree of fermentation. In addition, SFT showed the highest theanine and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid contents. SFT at a concentration of 25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL showed the highest activity in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay among all samples. Furthermore, the 2,2'-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical scavenging activity of 25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL SFT was higher than that of l-ascorbic acid. Fermented tea suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and macrophage-1, as well as inhibited overexpression of apoptotic signals, including p-53, cleaved caspase-3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. Moreover, GT, SFT, and FT regulated the MPTP-induced oxidative stress-related factors, including superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4. Fermented tea also alleviated MPTP-induced behavioral impairment and dopaminergic neuronal damage and reduced \u03b1-synuclein levels. These results indicate that fermented tea is effective for the treatment of neuro-inflammatory, neuro-apoptotic, and neuro-oxidative disorders.",

    "abstract": "The enteric nervous system (ENS) plays a central role in developing Parkinson's disease (PD) constipation, and the regulation of the ENS may be a key component in treating PD constipation. Electroacupuncture (EA) can effectively treat constipation symptoms in PD, but research on its specific mechanisms, especially in terms of ENS, is relatively lacking. Therefore, we investigated whether EA at ST25 promotes the restoration of ENS structure and colonic motor function in the rotenone-induced PD constipation rat model.\nIn this study, we evaluated constipation symptoms by stool characteristics, excretion and water volume, and whole gut transit time and observed colonic motility regulation through colonic motion detection and pathological changes in the colonic myenteric nervous plexus by transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence staining.\nEA significantly improved the constipation symptoms and positively adjusted the colonic motility in rotenone-induced PD constipation rats. At the same time, EA reversed the rotenone-induced colonic myenteric nervous plexus injury and regulated the ratio of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters.\nOur results indicate that EA treatment of PD constipation may be mediated through the adjustment of ENS.",

    "abstract": "Physical exercise is considered an effective intervention for maintaining or improving quality of life (QoL) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), but there is no evidence showing which type of physical exercise intervention has more positive effects. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the evidence regarding the effectiveness of exercise interventions on improving QoL in patients with PD, comparing different types of exercise interventions.\nA literature search was conducted through January 2022. The methodological quality of the trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool RoB2. For the meta-analysis, physical exercise interventions were classified into 5 training categories: resistance, endurance, alternative exercises, dance, and sensorimotor interventions. A standard meta-analysis and network meta-analysis were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of the different types of physical exercise interventions.\nThe search retrieved 2451 studies, 48 of which were included in this network meta-analysis with a total of 2977 patients with PD. The indirect effects of the network meta-analysis showed positive results for alternative exercises (-0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.76, -0.16), dance (-0.63; 95% CI: -1.08, -0.17), and sensorimotor interventions (-0.23; 95% CI: -0.40, -0.07) versus control comparisons.\nMore research is needed to determine the types of physical exercise interventions that are most beneficial and for which conditions of the disease they have the most positive effects.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A398 ).",

    "abstract": "The cost-effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is more favorable than best medical treatment (BMT) for advanced Parkinson disease (PD) in developed countries. However, it remains unclear in developing countries, where the cost of DBS may not be reimbursed by health care system.\nTo model and evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of DBS for advanced PD in China from a patient payer perspective.\nWe developed a Markov model representing the clinical progress of PD to predict the disease progression and related medical costs in a 15-year time horizon. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and net benefit were used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DBS vs BMT.\nDBS treatment led to discounted total costs of \u00a5370\u2009768 ($56\u2009515.20) (95% CI, \u00a5369\u2009621.53-371\u2009914.88), compared with \u00a548\u2009808 ($7439.68) (95% CI, \u00a548\u2009502.63-49\u2009114.21) for BMT, with an additional 1.51 quality-adjusted life years gained, resulting in an ICER of \u00a5213\u2009544 ($32\u2009549.96)/quality-adjusted life years (95% CI, \u00a5208\u2009177.35-218\u2009910.10). Sensitivity analysis showed that DBS-related cost has the most substantial impact on ICER. Nation-wide net benefit of BMT and DBS were \u00a533\u2009819 ($5154.94) (95% CI, \u00a530\u2009211.24-37\u2009426) and \u00a530\u2009361 ($4627.85) (95% CI, \u00a525\u2009587.03-39\u2009433.66), respectively. Patient demographic analysis showed that more favorable DBS cost-effectiveness was associated with younger age and less severe disease stage.\nDBS is cost-effective for patients with advanced PD over a 15-year time horizon in China. However, compared with developed countries, DBS remains a substantial economic burden for patients when no reimbursement is provided. Our findings may help inform cost-effectiveness-based decision making for clinical care of PD in developing countries.",

This study aimed to investigate mortality associated with bilateral STN DBS in patients with PD and to assess the factors associated with mortality and causes of death after DBS.\nWe reviewed the medical records of 257 patients with PD who underwent bilateral STN DBS at the Movement Disorder Center at Seoul National University Hospital between March 2005 and November 2018. Patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery and annually thereafter. The cause and date of death were obtained from interviews with caregivers or from medical certificates at the last follow-up.\nOf the 257 patients with PD, 48 patients (18.7%) died, with a median time of death of 11.2 years after surgery. Pneumonia was the most common cause of death. Older age of disease onset, preoperative falling score while on medication, and higher preoperative total levodopa equivalent daily dose were associated with a higher risk of mortality in time-dependent Cox regression analysis.\nThese results confirm the mortality outcome of STN DBS in patients with advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with the death of mid-brain dopaminergic neurons. Unfortunately, no effective cure or diagnostic biomarkers for PD are available yet. To address this, the present study focuses on brain-enriched small non-coding regulatory RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs) that are released into the circulation packaged inside small extracellular vesicles called exosomes. We collected blood samples from PD patients and isolated exosomes from the plasma. qPCR-based detection revealed a particular neuron-enriched miR-128 to be significantly decreased in the patient-derived exosomes. Interestingly, a concomitant decreased expression of miR-128 was observed in the cellular models of PD. Fluorescent live cell imaging and flow-cytometry revealed that over-expression of miR-128 can prevent 6-OHDA-mediated mitochondrial superoxide production and induction of neuronal death respectively. This neuroprotective effect was found to be induced by miR-128-mediated inhibition of FoxO3a activation, a transcription factor involved in apoptosis. miR-128 over-expression also resulted in down-regulation of pro-apoptotic FoxO3a targets- FasL and PUMA, at both transcript and protein levels. Further downstream, miR-128 over-expression inhibited activation of caspases-8, -9 and -3, preventing both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Additionally, over expression of miR-128 prevented down-regulation of synaptic proteins- Synaptophysin and PSD-95 and attenuated neurite shortening, thereby maintaining overall neuronal integrity. Thus, our study depicts the intracellular role of miR-128 in neuronal apoptosis and neurodegeneration and its implications as a biomarker being detectable in the circulating exosomes of PD patient blood. Thus, characterization of such exosomal brain-enriched miRNAs hold promise for effective detection and diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). To maximize therapeutic outcome, optimal DBS settings must be carefully selected for each patient. Unfortunately, this is not always achieved because of: (1) increased technological complexity of DBS devices, (2) time restraints, or lack of expertise, and (3) delayed therapeutic response of some symptoms. Biomarkers to accurately predict the most effective stimulation settings for each patient could streamline this process and improve DBS outcomes.\nTo investigate the use of evoked potentials (EPs) to predict clinical outcomes in PD patients with DBS.\nIn ten patients (12 hemispheres), a monopolar review was performed by systematically stimulating on each DBS contact and measuring the therapeutic window. Standard imaging data were collected. EEG-based EPs were then recorded in response to stimulation at 10 Hz for 50 s on each DBS-contact. Linear mixed models were used to assess how well both EPs and image-derived information predicted the clinical data.\nEvoked potential peaks at 3 ms (P3) and at 10 ms (P10) were observed in nine and eleven hemispheres, respectively. Clinical data were well predicted using either P3 or P10. A separate model showed that the image-derived information also predicted clinical data with similar accuracy. Combining both EPs and image-derived information in one model yielded the highest predictive value.\nEvoked potentials can accurately predict clinical DBS responses. Combining EPs with imaging data further improves this prediction. Future refinement of this approach may streamline DBS programming, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes.\nClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT04658641.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by gradual and selective loss of neurons in the central nervous system. They affect more than 50 million people worldwide, and their incidence increases with age. Although most cases of AD and PD are sporadic, some are caused by genetic mutations that are inherited. Both sporadic and familial cases display complex neuropathology and represent the most perplexing neurological disorders. Because of the undefined pathogenesis and complex clinical manifestations, there is still no effective treatment for both AD and PD. Understanding the pathogenesis of these important neurodegenerative diseases is important for developing successful therapies. Increasing evidence suggests that microglial autophagy is associated with the pathogenesis of AD and PD, and its dysfunction has been implicated in disease progression. In this review, we focus on the autophagy function in microglia and its dysfunction in AD and PD disease models in an attempt to help our understanding of the pathogenesis and identifying new therapeutic targets of AD and PD.",

    "abstract": "To investigate and contrast the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), including repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), on walking and balance ability in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe PubMed, Embase, Medline, Cochrane, CNKI, and Chinese WanFang databases were searched up to June 2022. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias guidelines, and the standardized mean differences (SMD) or mean differences (MD) for each outcome were calculated.\nAmong 32 eligible studies, including 1,586 participants were analyzed in this meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that NIBS was effective in improving UPDRS-III scores (MD = -2.07; 95% CI, -2.62 to -1.53; \nNIBS benefits some walking ability variables but not balance ability in 36 patients with PD. The rTMS significantly improved UPDRS-III scores and TUGT time compared to tDCS. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal protocol and to illuminate effects based on the ideal target brain regions, stimulation intensity, timing, and type of intervention.\nhttp://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier CRD42022350782.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain (SNpc). Extensive studies into genetic and cellular models of PD implicate protein trafficking as a prominent contributor to the death of these dopaminergic neurons. Considerable evidence also suggests the involvement of \u03b1-synuclein as a central component of the characteristic cell death in PD and it is a major structural constituent of proteinaceous inclusion bodies (Lewy bodies; LB). \u03b1-synuclein research has been a vital part of PD research in recent years, with newly discovered evidence suggesting that \u03b1-synuclein can propagate through the brain via prion-like mechanisms. Healthy cells can internalize toxic \u03b1-synuclein species and seed endogenous \u03b1-synuclein to form large, pathogenic aggregates and form LBs. A better understanding of how \u03b1-synuclein can propagate, enter and be cleared from the cell is vital for therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common age-related chronic neurodegenerative disease. There is currently no affordable, effective, and less invasive test for PD diagnosis. Metabolite profiling in blood and blood-based gene transcripts is thought to be an ideal method for diagnosing PD.\nIn this study, the objective is to identify the potential diagnostic biomarkers of PD by analyzing microarray gene expression data of samples from PD patients.\nA computational approach, namely, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to construct co-expression gene networks and identify the key modules that were highly correlated with PD from the GSE99039 dataset. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis was performed to identify the hub genes in the key modules with strong association with PD. The selected hub genes were then used to construct a diagnostic model based on logistic regression analysis, and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the efficacy of the model using the GSE99039 dataset. Finally, Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was used to validate the hub genes.\nWGCNA identified two key modules associated with inflammation and immune response. Seven hub genes, LILRB1, LSP1, SIPA1, SLC15A3, MBOAT7, RNF24, and TLE3 were identified from the two modules and used to construct diagnostic models. ROC analysis showed that the diagnostic model had a good diagnostic performance for PD in the training and testing datasets. Results of the RT-PCR experiments showed that there were significant differences in the mRNA expression of LILRB1, LSP1, and MBOAT7 among the seven hub genes.\nThe 7-gene panel (LILRB1, LSP1, SIPA1, SLC15A3, MBOAT7, RNF24, and TLE3) will serve as a potential diagnostic signature for PD.",

Seven hub genes, LILRB1, LSP1, SIPA1, SLC15A3, MBOAT7, RNF24, and TLE3 were identified from the two modules and used to construct diagnostic models. ROC analysis showed that the diagnostic model had a good diagnostic performance for PD in the training and testing datasets.

    "abstract": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for depression in persons with Parkinson's disease (PwPD), but there are significant barriers preventing PwPD from receiving care in person. Telehealth CBT circumvents many of these barriers.\nWe conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of telehealth transdiagnostic CBT intervention for depression in PwPD.\nTwelve PwPD with Major Depressive Disorder were enrolled, half randomly assigned to the treatment-immediate condition (TI) and half to the waitlist control condition (WLC). TI and WLC participants received 12 CBT sessions and assessments before treatment, immediately after treatment, and at the 6-week follow-up.\nThe intervention was efficacious for treating depression in PwPD, with secondary benefits to anxiety, apathy, learning, memory, and quality of life. Improvements were largely maintained at follow-up. The intervention was highly feasible and acceptable.\nTelehealth transdiagnostic CBT was an effective intervention for PwPD with depression.",

    "abstract": "Pisa syndrome (PS) and camptocormia (CC) are postural abnormalities frequently associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Their pathophysiology remains unclear, but the role of cognitive deficits has been postulated.\nTo identify differences in the neuropsychological functioning of patients with PD with PS or CC compared with matched patients with PD without postural abnormalities.\nWe performed a case-control study including 57 patients with PD with PS (PS+) or CC (CC+) and 57 PD controls without postural abnormalities matched for sex, age, PD duration, phenotype, and stage. Patients were divided into four groups: PS+ (n\u00a0=\u00a032), PS+ controls (PS-, n\u00a0=\u00a032), CC+ (n\u00a0=\u00a025), and CC+ controls (CC-, n\u00a0=\u00a025). We compared PS+ versus PS- and CC+ versus CC- using a neuropsychological battery assessing memory, attention, executive functions, visuospatial abilities, and language. Subjective visual vertical (SVV) perception was assessed by the Bucket test as a sign of vestibular function; the misperception of trunk position, defined as a mismatch between the objective versus subjective evaluation of the trunk bending angle >5\u00b0, was evaluated in PS+ and CC+.\nPS+ showed significantly worse visuospatial performances (\nLow visuospatial performances and vestibular tone imbalance are significantly associated with PS but not with CC. These findings suggest different pathophysiology for the two main postural abnormalities associated with PD and can foster adequate therapeutic and prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to compare the motor effect of bilateral globus pallidus interna (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on motor subtypes of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and identify preoperative predictive factors of short-term motor outcome.\nWe retrospectively investigated bilateral GPi DBS clinical outcomes in 55 PD patients in 1 year follow up. Motor outcome was measured by the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III before and 1 year after surgery. Clinical outcomes were compared among different motor subtypes. Preoperative predictors of motor outcome were assessed by performing univariate and multivariate linear regression and logistic regression analyses.\nAt 1 year following implantation, GPi DBS significantly improved the off-medication MDS-UPDRS III scores in all motor subtype cohorts, with prominent improvement in tremor. No significant difference of postoperative motor symptoms changes was found except greater tremor improvement achieved in both the tremor-dominant (TD) and indeterminate (IND) patients compared to the postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) patients. High percentage of PIGD patients were weak responders to DBS. Better levodopa responsiveness and more severe tremor predicted greater overall improvement of motor function in the entire cohort. Similarly, both levodopa responsiveness and tremor improvement were confirmed as predictors for motor improvement in PIGD patients.\nBilateral GPi DBS could effectively improve motor outcomes in PD patients regardless of motor subtypes. Both TD and IND patients obtained larger tremor improvement. The intensity of levodopa responsiveness and the severity of tremor could serve as predictors of motor improvement 1 year after GPi DBS.",

    "abstract": "Neurological motor disorders (NMDs) such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are characterized by the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins that trigger cell death of specific neuronal populations in the central nervous system. Differential neuronal loss initiates the impaired motor control and cognitive function in the affected patients. Although major advances have been carried out to understand the molecular basis of these diseases, to date there are no treatments that can prevent, cure, or significantly delay the progression of the disease. In this context, strategies such as gene editing, cellular therapy, among others, have gained attention as they effectively reduce the load of toxic protein aggregates in different models of neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, these strategies are expensive and difficult to deliver into the patients' nervous system. Thus, small molecules and natural products that reduce protein aggregation levels are highly sought after. Numerous drug discovery efforts have analyzed large libraries of synthetic compounds for the treatment of different NMDs, with a few candidates reaching clinical trials. Moreover, the recognition of new druggable targets for NMDs has allowed the discovery of new small molecules that have demonstrated their efficacy in pre-clinical studies. It is also important to recognize the contribution of natural products to the discovery of new candidates that can prevent or cure NMDs. Additionally, the repurposing of drugs for the treatment of NMDs has gained huge attention as they have already been through clinical trials confirming their safety in humans, which can accelerate the development of new treatment. In this review, we will focus on the new advances in the discovery of small molecules for the treatment of Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. We will begin by discussing the available pharmacological treatments to modulate the progression of neurodegeneration and to alleviate the motor symptoms in these diseases. Then, we will analyze those small molecules that have reached or are currently under clinical trials, including natural products and repurposed drugs.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) affects males more than females. The reasons for the gender differences in PD prevalence remain unclear.\nThe objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to update the overall male/female prevalence ratios (OPR).\nWe updated previous work by searching MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and OVID for articles reporting PD prevalence for both genders between 2011 and 2021. We calculated OPRs and investigated heterogeneity in effect estimates.\nWe included 19 new articles and 13 articles from a previously published meta-analysis. The OPR was 1.18, 95% CI, [1.03, 1.36]. The OPR was lowest in Asia and appeared to be decreasing over time. Study design, national wealth, and participant age did not explain OPR heterogeneity.\nGender differences in PD prevalence may not be as stark as previously thought. Studies are needed to understand the role of other determinants of gender differences in PD prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and those with multiple system atrophy (MSA) show similar symptoms but have different clinical treatments. It will be helpful to discriminate between these two kinds of patients at an early or middle stage. The purpose of this study is to highlight the differences in posturographic characterization between patients with PD and those with MSA during quiet standing and perturbed standing.\nA total of clinically diagnosed 42 patients with PD and 32 patients with MSA participated in the experiment. Patients were asked to first stand on a static balance force platform and then on a dynamic balance (medial-lateral rocker) force platform to measure the center of pressure (COP) trajectory during an eyes-open (EO) state. The posturographic parameters were obtained under the two standing conditions for statistical analysis.\nFour posturographic variables were calculated and analyzed, namely, the standard deviation of COP position (SD), sway path of COP position (SP), an elliptical area covering the 95% COP position trajectory (EA), sway path of COP position (SP), and integral area of the power spectral density at 0-0.5 Hz frequency band (PSD). Except for variable EA, the other three variables are all in the medial-lateral (ML) direction. In the static balance experiment, there were no significant differences between the four variables between patients with PD and those with MSA. However, in the dynamic balance experiment, the obtained four variables all presented significant differences between patients with PD and those with MSA.\nThe dynamic posturographic variables with significant differences between patients with PD and those with MSA imply that patients with MSA have worse postural control ability in the medial-lateral (ML) direction compared to patients with PD. The obtained dynamic indices may help supplemental clinical evaluation to discriminate between patients with MSA and those with PD.",

    "abstract": "Neurological complications are considered the leading cause of disability and the second cause of death worldwide. Although the most common neurological disorders affecting a large population are Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD), no definitive treatment has been propounded in the clinic. As in recent years, special attention has been paid to medicinal herbal products as one of the ways to meet the challenges of treating diseases. This review study aimed to introduce the naringin neuroprotective effects as an abundant flavonoid in grapes and citrus fruits on the most common neurological disorders, including AD and PD. For this purpose, the specified keywords were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar, and the results were entered into the study after a concise overview. The findings show naringin can confront neurological disorders through several mechanisms such as modulating stress response pathways, preventing apoptosis, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, excessive chelating amounts of metal ions, thereby improving cognitive impairment and memory loss induced by neurological disorders. However, further studies, particularly on human, are critical for the final confirmation of obtained findings. [GMJ.2022;11:e2337].",

    "abstract": "Guidelines for electrophysiology study (EPS) and catheter ablation in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) are age based, but size may be a more relevant factor in determination of outcomes.\nThe goal of this study was to evaluate the association of patient weight with outcomes of catheter ablation for pediatric WPW.\nA multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed on children aged 1 to 21 years with WPW and first-time EPS from April 2016 to December 2019 recorded in the IMPACT (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment) registry, excluding those with congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and >1 ablation target. A weight threshold of 30\u00a0kg was selected, representing 1 SD below the cohort mean. The primary outcome was major adverse events (MAEs); additional outcomes included deferred ablation, use of cryoablation, and ablation success.\nA total of 4,456 subjects from 84 centers were evaluated, with 14% weighing\u00a0<30\u00a0kg. Subjects weighing\u00a0<30\u00a0kg were more likely to have preprocedural supraventricular tachycardia (45% vs 29%; P\u00a0< 0.001) and less likely to have right septal accessory pathways (25% vs 33%; P\u00a0< 0.001). MAEs were rare, although with higher incidence in the\u00a0<30\u00a0kg cohort (0.3% vs 0.05%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). No difference was seen in likelihood of deferred ablation (9% vs 12%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.07) or use of cryoablation (11% vs 11%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.70). Success was higher in the\u00a0<30\u00a0kg cohort: 95% vs 92% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). This effect persisted after adjusting for covariates (odds ratio: 1.6; 95%\u00a0CI: 1.01-2.70; P\u00a0=\u00a00.046).\nWeight\u00a0<30\u00a0kg was associated with a small but elevated risk of MAEs. Rates of deferred ablation and cryoablation were similar. Adjusting for factors (including accessory pathway type and location), weight\u00a0<30\u00a0kg remained an independent predictor of acute success.",

    "abstract": "Biomarkers to aid diagnosis and delineate the progression of Parkinson's disease are vital for targeting treatment in the early phases of the disease. Here, we aim to discover a multi-protein panel representative of Parkinson's and make mechanistic inferences from protein expression profiles within the broader objective of finding novel biomarkers. We used aptamer-based technology (SomaLogic\u00ae) to measure proteins in 1599 serum samples, 85 cerebrospinal fluid samples and 37 brain tissue samples collected from two observational longitudinal cohorts (the Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre and Tracking Parkinson's) and the Parkinson's Disease Brain Bank, respectively. Random forest machine learning was performed to discover new proteins related to disease status and generate multi-protein expression signatures with potential novel biomarkers. Differential regulation analysis and pathway analysis were performed to identify functional and mechanistic disease associations. The most consistent diagnostic classifier signature was tested across modalities [cerebrospinal fluid (area under curve) = 0.74, ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. There is evidence that PD has a wider prevalence among men, which indicates the existing role of sex hormones in the pathogenesis of the disease. The article presents an overview of studies devoted to the study of sex differences in the incidence and symptoms of PD. Drug therapy with androgens, androgen precursors, antiandrogens and drugs that modify androgen metabolism is available for the treatment of various endocrine conditions, having translational significance for PD, but none of these drugs has yet shown sufficient effectiveness. Although PD has now been proven to be more common in men than in women, androgens do not always have any effect on the symptoms or progression of the disease. 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors have shown neuroprotective and anti-dyskinetic activity and need further investigation. Despite the fact that the neuroprotective effect of dutasteride was observed only before damage to DA neurons, the absence of a negative effect makes it an attractive drug for use in patients with PD due to its anti-dyskinetic properties.\n\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0411\u041f)

    "abstract": "Central anosmia is a potential marker of the prodrome and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that olfactory dysfunction is related to abnormal changes in central olfactory-related structures in patients with early PD.\nThis study, which was conducted at Guanyun People's Hospital, analyzed the resting-state functional magnetic resonance data using the functional covariance connection strength method to decode the functional connectivity between the white-gray matter in a Chinese population comprising 14 patients with PD and 13 controls.\nThe following correlations were observed in patients with PD: specific gray matter areas related to smell (i.e., the brainstem, right cerebellum, right temporal fusiform cortex, bilateral superior temporal gyrus, right Insula, left frontal pole and right superior parietal lobule) had abnormal connections with white matter fiber bundles (i.e., the left posterior thalamic radiation, bilateral posterior corona radiata, bilateral superior corona radiata and right superior longitudinal fasciculus); the connection between the brainstem [region of interest (ROI) 1] and right cerebellum (ROI2) showed a strong correlation. Right posterior corona radiation (ROI11) showed a strong correlation with part 2 of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and right superior longitudinal fasciculus (ROI14) showed a strong correlation with parts 1, 2, and 3 of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and Hoehn and Yahr Scale.\nThe characteristics of olfactory-related brain networks can be potentially used as neuroimaging biomarkers for characterizing PD states. In the future, dynamic testing of olfactory function may help improve the accuracy and specificity of olfactory dysfunction in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on Parkinson's disease (PD) varies across the stimulation targets. This study aims to estimate the effect of different TMS targets on motor symptoms in PD.\nA Bayesian hierarchical model was built to assess the effects across different TMS targets, and the rank probabilities and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values were calculated to determine the ranks of each target. The primary outcome was the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part-III. Inconsistency between direct and indirect comparisons was assessed using the node-splitting method.\nThirty-six trials with 1,122 subjects were included for analysis. The pair-wise meta-analysis results showed that TMS could significantly improve motor symptoms in PD patients. Network meta-analysis results showed that the high-frequency stimulation over bilateral M1, bilateral DLPFC, and M1+DLPFC could significantly reduce the UPDRS-III scores compared with sham conditions. The high-frequency stimulation over both M1 and DLPFC had a more significant effect when compared with other parameters, and ranked first with the highest SCURA value. There was no significant inconsistency between direct and indirect comparisons.\nConsidering all settings reported in our research, high-frequency stimulation over bilateral M1 or bilateral DLPFC has a moderate beneficial effect on the improvement of motor symptoms in PD (high confidence rating). High-frequency stimulation over M1+DLPFC has a prominent beneficial effect and appears to be the most effective TMS parameter setting for ameliorating motor symptoms of PD patients (high confidence rating).",

Network meta-analysis results showed that the high-frequency stimulation over bilateral M1, bilateral DLPFC, and M1+DLPFC could significantly reduce the UPDRS-III scores compared with sham conditions. The high-frequency stimulation over both M1 and DLPFC had a more significant effect when compared with other parameters, and ranked first with the highest SCURA value.

    "abstract": "The levodopa challenge test (LCT) has been routinely used in Parkinson disease (PD) evaluation and predicts the outcome of deep brain stimulation (DBS). Guidelines recommend that patients with an improvement in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-III score\u2009>\u200933% in the LCT receive DBS treatment. However, LCT results are affected by many factors, and only provide information on the immediate effectiveness of dopamine. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between LCT outcome and brain imaging features of PD patients to determine whether the latter can be used to identify candidates for DBS.\nA total of 38 PD patients were enrolled in the study. Based on improvement in UPDRS-III score in the LCT, patients were divided into low improvement (PD-LCT-L) and high improvement (PD-LCT-H) groups. Each patient's neural network was reconstructed based on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data using the Jensen-Shannon divergence similarity estimation method. The network was established with the multiple kernel support vector machine technique. We analyzed differences in individual morphologic brain networks and their global and local metrics to determine whether there were differences in the connectomes of PD-LCT-L and PD-LCT-H groups.\nThe 2 groups were similar in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics. Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD levodopa responsiveness was 26.52%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.47% in the PD-LCT-L group (N\u2009=\u200913) and 58.66%\u2009\u00b1\u20094.09% in the PD-LCT-H group (\nMorphologic brain network assessment is a valuable method for predicting levodopa responsiveness in PD patients, which can facilitate the selection of candidates for DBS.",

    "abstract": "The Cross-Cultural Dementia (CCD) is a new screening tool to evaluate cognitive impairment based on a cross-cultural perspective to reduce the bias of education, and language and cultural differences. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic properties of the CCD in Spaniards for the assessment of patients with Alzheimer's disease in mild cognitive impairment (AD-MCI) and mild dementia stages (AD-D) and patients with mild cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI).\nSixty participants with AD (50% MCI) and thirty with PD-MCI were enrolled. Each clinical group was compared against a healthy control group (HC) with the same number of participants and no significant differences in age, education, and sex. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and CCD were completed. Intergroup comparisons, ROC curves, and cut-off scores were calculated for the study of diagnostic properties.\nIntergroup differences were found in accordance with the cognitive profile of each clinical condition. Memory measures (Objects test) were especially relevant for the classification between AD and HC. Memory and executive function scores (Sun-Moon and Dots tests) were useful in the case of PD-MCI and HC. Furthermore, CCD described differences in executive functions and speed scores comparing AD-MCI and PD-MCI. Correlations between standardized neuropsychological tests and CCD measures supported the convergent validity of the test.\nCCD showed good discrimination properties and cut-off scores for dementia and extended its application to a sample of prodromal stages of AD and PD with mild cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "The Movement Disorders Society (MDS)-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is increasingly used to assess motor dysfunction before and after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS).\nWe, therefore, investigated whether the MDS-UPDRS can detect longitudinal changes in motor function after STN-DBS in the same way as UPDRS.\nWe examined 21 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (mean age 59.2 \u00b1 10.6 years, mean disease duration 12.0 \u00b1 3.0 years) who underwent STN-DBS and whose motor functions were assessed by the UPDRS and MDS-UPDRS before, 3 months after, and 1 year after STN-DBS. We then evaluated the consistency between the scores of Parts II and III of the UPDRS and MDS-UPDRS during the off phase using Lin's concordance coefficient (LCC) and a Bland-Altman plot.\nThe scores of Parts II and III of both the UPDRS and MDS-UPDRS were significantly decreased 3 months and 1 year after STN-DBS during the off phase. Scores of the UPDRS and MDS-UPDRS showed significant positive correlations before and after STN-DBS. We calculated estimated MDS-UPDRS scores from the UPDRS scores using a regression line and calculated the LCC between the MDS-UPDRS and the estimated MDS-UPDRS scores. The LCC value was 0.59-0.91, which suggests a relatively high consistency between the UPDRS and MDS-UPDRS. The Bland-Altman plot showed that differences between both scores were basically within \u00b11.96 standard deviations of the difference.\nThe present preliminary study indicated that the utility of the MDS-UPDRS in evaluating motor function before and after STN-DBS demonstrates its potential equivalency to the UPDRS.",

Scores of the UPDRS and MDS-UPDRS showed significant positive correlations before and after STN-DBS. We calculated estimated MDS-UPDRS scores from the UPDRS scores using a regression line and calculated the LCC between the MDS-UPDRS and the estimated MDS-UPDRS scores. The LCC value was 0.59-0.91, which suggests a relatively high consistency between the UPDRS and MDS-UPDRS. The Bland-Altman plot showed that differences between both scores were basically within \u00b11.96 standard deviations of the difference.",

    "abstract": "Although the seasonal variation of motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been reported, the association between seasonal change and quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease remains to be explored.\nWe recruited 1,036 patients with PD in this cross-sectional retrospective study. The patients were divided into four groups based on their date of assessment, according to the classical four seasons: group 1: March to May (\nA significant difference in PDQ-39 was found between group 1 (spring months) and group 3 (autumn months) after correction (\nThe current study reported seasonal fluctuation of QoL in patients with PD, with higher scores during the spring months and lower scores in the autumn months. Since the determinants for QoL also vary by season, clinicians might need to focus on specific factors across seasons before initiating therapy.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, affecting millions and costing billions each year in the United States alone. Despite tremendous progress in developing therapeutics that manage the symptoms of these two diseases, the scientific community has yet to develop a treatment that effectively slows down, inhibits, or cures neurodegeneration. To gain a better understanding of the current therapeutic frontier for the treatment of AD and PD, we provide a review on past and present therapeutic strategies for these two major neurodegenerative disorders in the clinical trial process. We briefly recap currently US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies, and then explore trends in clinical trials across the variables of therapy mechanism of disease intervention, administration route, use of delivery vehicle, and outcome measures, across the clinical phases over time for \"Drug\" and \"Biologic\" therapeutics. We then present the success rate of past clinical trials and analyze the intersections in therapeutic approaches for AD and PD, revealing the shift in clinical trials away from therapies targeting neurotransmitter systems that provide symptomatic relief, and towards anti-aggregation, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and regeneration strategies that aim to inhibit the root causes of disease progression. We also highlight the evolving distribution of the types of \"Biologic\" therapies investigated, and the slowly increasing yet still severe under-utilization of delivery vehicles for AD and PD therapeutics. We then briefly discuss novel preclinical strategies for treating AD and PD. Overall, this review aims to provide a succinct overview of the clinical landscape of AD and PD therapies to better understand the field's therapeutic strategy in the past and the field's evolution in approach to the present, to better inform how to effectively treat AD and PD in the future.",

    "abstract": "Brain administration of human platelet lysates (HPL) is a potential emerging biotherapy of neurodegenerative and traumatic diseases of the central nervous system. HPLs being prepared from pooled platelet concentrates, thereby increasing viral risks, manufacturing processes should incorporate robust virus-reduction treatments. We evaluated a 19\u2009\u00b1\u20092-nm virus removal nanofiltration process using hydrophilic regenerated cellulose hollow fibers on the properties of a neuroprotective heat-treated HPL (HPPL). Spiking experiments demonstrated >5.30 log removal of 20-22-nm non-enveloped minute virus of mice-mock particles using an immuno-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. The nanofiltered HPPL (NHPPL) contained a range of neurotrophic factors like HPPL. There was >2 log removal of extracellular vesicles (EVs), associated with decreased expression of pro-thrombogenic phosphatidylserine and procoagulant activity. LC-MS/MS proteomics showed that ca. 80% of HPPL proteins, including neurotrophins, cytokines, and antioxidants, were still found in NHPPL, whereas proteins associated with some infections and cancer-associated pathways, pro-coagulation and EVs, were removed. NHPPL maintained intact neuroprotective activity in Lund human mesencephalic dopaminergic neuron model of Parkinson's disease (PD), stimulated the differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuronal cells and showed preserved anti-inflammatory function upon intranasal administration in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Therefore, nanofiltration of HPL is feasible, lowers the viral, prothrombotic and procoagulant risks, and preserves the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties in neuronal pre-clinical models of PD and TBI.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease commonly seen in aged people, in which gastrointestinal dysfunction is the most common nonmotor symptom and the activation of the gut-brain axis by intestinal inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. In a previous study, curcumin was considered neuroprotective in PD, and this neuroprotective mechanism may act by inhibiting intestinal inflammation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of curcumin on motor dysfunction and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in a PD mouse model, induced by N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) using open field test and pole test behavioral assessments and the immunofluorescence and Western blot methods. Moreover, the effects of curcumin on gastrointestinal dysfunction, gastric barrier function, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the SIRT1/NRF2 pathway in intestinal tissues in a PD mouse model were assessed using fecal parameters and intestinal dynamics, immunofluorescence, ELISA, and Western blot. A motor impairment study of an MPTP-induced mouse group prior to treatment with curcumin had a lower total movement distance and a slow average speed, while there was no statistical difference in the curcumin group. After treatment with curcumin, the total movement distance and average speed improved, the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) rate in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum were reduced, the pyroptosis of AIM2 and caspase-1 activations were inhibited, and intestinal inflammatory factors and intestinal inflammation were reduced. Curcumin improved gastrointestinal disorders and gastrointestinal barrier function in the MPTP-induced mice and reversed MPTP-induced motor dysfunction and dopaminergic neuron loss in mice. The above effects may be partly dependent on curcumin activation of the SIRT1/NRF2 pathway in the colon. This study provides a potential opportunity to develop new preventive measures and novel therapeutic approaches that could target the gut-brain axis in the context of PD and provide a new intervention in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsonian tremors are sometimes confused with essential tremors or other conditions. Recently, researchers conducted several studies on tremor evaluation using wearable sensors and devices, which may support accurate diagnosis. Mechanical devices are also commonly used to treat tremors and have been actively researched and developed. Here, we aimed to review recent progress and the efficacy of the devices related to Parkinsonian tremors.\nThe PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for articles. We searched for \"Parkinson disease\" and \"tremor\" and \"device\".\nEighty-six articles were selected by our systematic approach. Many studies demonstrated that the diagnosis and evaluation of tremors in patients with PD can be done accurately by machine learning algorithms. Mechanical devices for tremor suppression include deep brain stimulation (DBS), electrical muscle stimulation, and orthosis. In recent years, adaptive DBS and optimization of stimulation parameters have been studied to further improve treatment efficacy.\nDue to developments using state-of-the-art techniques, effectiveness in diagnosing and evaluating tremor and suppressing it using these devices is satisfactorily high in many studies. However, other than DBS, no devices are in practical use. To acquire high-level evidence, large-scale studies and randomized controlled trials are needed for these devices.",

    "abstract": "Background: Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective method for treating Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). However, safety of STN-DBS treating PD patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidity is rarely focused and reported. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of STN-DBS treating PD patients with CVD comorbidity. Methods: We retrospectively included PD patients with CVD comorbidity who underwent STN-DBS under general anesthesia in our center from January 2019 to January 2021. Patient\u2019s PD symptoms and cardiopulmonary function were evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) before surgery. Post-operative clinical outcome and complications were collected until 1-year follow-up. Results: A total of 38 patients (26 men/12 women) of mean body mass index (BMI) 24.36 \u00b1 3.11 kg/m2, with different CVD comorbidity were finally speculated in the study. These CVD include mainly hypertension, coronary artery disease, thoracic aortic aneurysm, heart valve replacement, pacemaker implantation, atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale, and so on. The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 38 patients at admission day, pre-operation day, and discharge day timepoint was 135.63 \u00b1 18.08 mmHg, 137.66 \u00b1 12.26 mmHg, and 126.87 \u00b1 13.36 mmHg, respectively. This showed that blood pressure was controlled well under stable and normal state. The indicators of myocardial infarction Troponin T (Tn T-T) levels at pre-operation, 1 day and 7 days after operation timepoint were 0.014 \u00b1 0.011 ng/mL, 0.015 \u00b1 0.011 ng/mL, and 0.014 \u00b1 0.008 ng/mL, showing no significant fluctuation (F = 0.038, p = 0.962). STN-DBS improved PD patients\u2019 UPDRS III scores by 51.38% (t = 12.33, p < 0.0001) at 1-year follow-up compared with pre-operative baseline. A total of 11 adverse events were recorded until 1-year follow-up. No obvious cardiovascular complications such as intracranial hematoma or clot-related events occurred within 1 year after surgery except 1 case of hematuria. Conclusions: STN-DBS under general anesthesia is safe and effective for treating PD patients with CVD comorbidity. Our clinical experience and protocol of the MDT offers comprehensive perioperative evaluation for DBS surgery and mitigates bleeding and cardiovascular-associated events in PD patients with CVD comorbidity.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring the depth of anesthesia by electroencephalogram (EEG) based on the prefrontal cortex is an important means to achieve accurate regulation of anesthesia for subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) under general anesthesia in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, no previous study has conducted an in-depth investigation into this monitoring data. Here, we aimed to analyze the characteristics of prefrontal cortex EEG during DBS with propofol general anesthesia in patients with PD and determine the reference range of parameters derived from the depth of anesthesia monitoring. Additionally, we attempted to explore whether the use of benzodiazepines in the 3 days during hospitalization before surgery impacted the interpretation of the EEG parameters.\nWe included the data of 43 patients with PD who received STN DBS treatment and SedLine monitoring during the entire course of general anesthesia with propofol in a single center. Eighteen patients (41.86%) took benzodiazepines during hospitalization. We divided the anesthesia process into three stages: awake state before anesthesia, propofol anesthesia state, and shallow anesthesia state during microelectrode recording (MER). We analyzed the power spectral density (PSD) and derived parameters of the patients' prefrontal EEG, including the patient state index (PSI), spectral edge frequency (SEF) of the left and right sides, and the suppression ratio. The baseline characteristics, preoperative medication, preoperative frontal lobe image characteristics, preoperative motor and non-motor evaluation, intraoperative vital signs, internal environment and anesthetic information, and postoperative complications are listed. We also compared the groups according to whether they took benzodiazepines before surgery during hospitalization.\nThe average PSI of the awake state, propofol anesthesia state, and MER state were 89.86 \u00b1 6.89, 48.68 \u00b1 12.65, and 62.46 \u00b1 13.08, respectively. The preoperative administration of benzodiazepines did not significantly affect the PSI or SEF, but did reduce the total time of suppression, maximum suppression ratio, and the PSD of beta and gamma during MER. Regarding the occurrence of postoperative delirium and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, there was no significant difference between the two groups (chi-square test, \nFor the first time, we demonstrate the reference range of the derived parameters of the depth of anesthesia monitoring and the characteristics of the prefrontal EEG of patients with PD in the awake state, propofol anesthesia state, and shallow anesthesia during MER. Taking benzodiazepines in the 3 days during hospitalization before surgery reduces suppression and the PSD of beta and gamma during MER, but does not significantly affect the observation of anesthesiologists on the depth of anesthesia, nor affect the postoperative delirium and MMSE scores.",

    "abstract": "Activated microglia potentially cause neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PD, but the modulator of microglial release of MMP-9 remains obscure. Given the modulatory effect of chloride intracellular channel protein 2 (CLIC2) on MMPs, we aimed to determine the role of CLIC2 in regulating microglial MMP expression and activation. We found that CLIC2 is expressed in microglia and neurons in rat brain tissue and focused on the function of CLIC2 in primary cultured microglia. Exposure to recombinant CLIC2 protein enhanced microglial invasion activity, and its knockdown abolished this activity. Moreover, increased activation of MMP-9 was confirmed by the addition of the CLIC2 protein, and CLIC2 knockdown eliminated this activation. Additionally, increased expression of CLIC2 was observed in PD-modeled tissue. In conclusion, CLIC2 increases MMP-9 activity in the microglia, which are involved in PD pathogenesis.",

Data on the risk factors for delirium after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) surgery is not clarified in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients receiving total intravenous anesthesia. We aimed to investigate the risk factors for delirium after STN-DBS surgery in PD patients.\nThe retrospective cohort study was conducted, including 131 PD patients who underwent STN-DBS for the first time under total intravenous anesthesia from January to December 2021. Delirium assessments were performed twice daily for 7 days after surgery or until hospital discharge using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factor of POD.\nIn total, 22 (16.8%) of 131 patients were in the POD group, while the other 109 patients were in the Non-POD group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative Mini-mental State Examination score [odds ratio = 0.855, 95% confidence interval = 0.768-0.951, \nIn this retrospective cohort study of PD patients, a lower Mini-mental State Examination score and a higher unified Parkinson's disease rating scale part 3 (on state) score were the independent risk factors for delirium after STN-DBS surgery in PD patients under total intravenous anesthesia.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative pathology. Due to the limitations of existing therapeutic approaches, novel anti-parkinsonian medicines with non-dopamine mechanisms of action are clearly needed. One of the promising pharmacological targets for anti-Parkinson drug development is phosphodiesterase (PDE) 10A. The stimulating motor effects of PDE10A inhibition were detected only under the conditions of partial dopamine depletion. The results raise the question of whether PDE10A inhibitors are able to restore locomotor activity when dopamine levels are very low. To address this issue, we (1) developed and validated the rat model of acute severe dopamine deficiency and (2) tested the action of PDE10A inhibitor MP-10 in this model. All experiments were performed in dopamine transporter knockout (DAT-KO) rats. A tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, \u03b1-Methyl-DL-tyrosine (\u03b1MPT), was used as an agent to cause extreme dopamine deficiency. In vivo tests included estimation of locomotor activity and catalepsy levels in the bar test. Additionally, we evaluated the tissue content of dopamine in brain samples by HPLC analysis. The acute administration of \u03b1MPT to DAT-KO rats caused severe depletion of dopamine, immobility, and catalepsy (Dopamine-Deficient DAT-KO (DDD) rats). As expected, treatment with the L-DOPA and carbidopa combination restored the motor functions of DDD rats. Strikingly, administration of MP-10 also fully reversed immobility and catalepsy in DDD rats. According to neurochemical studies, the action of MP-10, in contrast to L-DOPA + carbidopa, seems to be dopamine-independent. These observations indicate that targeting PDE10A may represent a new promising approach in the development of non-dopamine therapies for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Aconitase 1 (ACO1) links oxidative stress and iron accumulation in Parkinson's disease (PD). ACO1 loses its aconitase activity and turns into iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) upon oxidative stress. IRP1 plays an important role in the accumulation of intracellular iron. Baicalein is a flavonoid isolated from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis. The present results show that baicalein could bind to ACO1 and protect its isoform from the oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Furthermore, baicalein promoted aconitase activity and inhibited IRP1 activation in rotenone-induced PD models. Additionally, baicalein decreased the hydroxyl radicals generated by iron. In conclusion, baicalein attenuated iron accumulation and iron-induced oxidative stress in the brain of PD rats by protecting ACO1.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common movement disorder disease. Left vagus nerve stimulation (LVNS) is a potential treatment option for PD. Compared with the left vagus nerve, the right vagus nerve is more closely connected with the midbrain dopaminergic neurons, which are the lesion locations of PD. However, whether right vagus nerve stimulation (RVNS) has a therapeutic effect on PD has not yet been studied. Therefore, in this study, we studied the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism of RVNS using a PD rat model.\nTo establish the PD rat model, 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with rotenone for 21 days. The cuff electrodes were implanted into the right cervical vagal carotid sheaths of the rats. The right vagus nerve was continuously stimulated for 14 days using a radio stimulation system. Behavioral tests were performed before and after stimulation. Finally, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and \u03b1-synuclein in the midbrain, including the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), were detected by immunofluorescence.\nA markedly lower distance traveled and rearing number was observed in the rotenone, rotenone + sham, and rotenone + RVNS groups compared to the vehicle group. After the stimulation days, the distance traveled and rearing number were both higher in the rotenone + RVNS group compared to the rotenone and rotenone + sham groups (P<0.01, P<0.0001). A remarkable increase in distance traveled and rearing number was observed in the rotenone + RVNS group after stimulation. TH expression in the vehicle group was significantly up-regulated than the other groups. RVNS markedly up-regulated TH expression level. A significantly higher expression of \u03b1-synuclein was observed in the rotenone, rotenone + sham, and rotenone + RVNS groups compared to the vehicle group. The expression of \u03b1-synuclein was lower in the rotenone + RVNS group compared to the rotenone and rotenone + sham groups. A markedly higher VMAT2 expression was observed in the vehicle group compared to other groups. RVNS significantly up-regulated VMAT2 expression.\nThe improved motor behavior and neuroprotective effects on the midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the PD rat model suggest that RVNS could be used as a potential treatment for PD.",

    "abstract": "To characterize patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who initiated dopamine agonist (DA) monotherapy, describe medication utilization and provider types, and estimate medication adherence and discontinuation rates.\nRetrospective study identified patients with PD in the Optum Research Database and included those with \u22651 claim for DA or levodopa between 09/01/2012 and 12/31/2018, \u22652 PD diagnoses, commercial or Medicare Advantage Part D (MAPD) insurance, \u226540\u00a0years old, and continuous medical and pharmacy coverage \u226512\u00a0months before and after index date. A subset of patients receiving DA monotherapy was selected for this analysis. Variables were analyzed descriptively. Adherence was measured with medication possession ratio (MPR) and proportion of days covered (PDC); defined as \u22650.80.\nPatients (N\u00a0=\u00a0642) had mean (SD) age of 70.2 (9.9) years, 70.6\u00a0% had MAPD coverage, and 61.7\u00a0% were male. Neurologists prescribed 64.6\u00a0% of DA monotherapy, and 56.9\u00a0% of patients had \u22652 PD diagnoses before or on the index date. Index therapy was discontinued by 44.1\u00a0% of patients, and 55.9\u00a0% persisted for 12\u00a0months without change. Mean (SD) time to discontinuation was 102 (79) days. Mean (SD) MPR for patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0562) with \u22652 fills was 0.84 (0.2); 70.3\u00a0% were MPR adherent. Mean (SD) PDC for all 642 patients was 0.66 (0.3); 50.5\u00a0% were PDC adherent.\nAdherence and continuation of therapy were suboptimal, which could translate into poor patient outcomes. Future studies could provide insights on the impact of low adherence and persistence with DA monotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease, however, besides the motor symptoms, such as rest tremor, hypokinesia, postural instability and rigidity, PD patients have also non-motor symptoms, namely neuropsychiatric disorders. Apart from the required motor symptoms, psychopathological symptoms are very common and include mood disorders, anxiety disorders, hallucinations, psychosis, cognitive deterioration and dementia. The underlying pathophysiological process in PD is mainly due to the loss of dopaminergic neural cells and thereby causes the shortage of nigrostriatal dopamine content in them. In addition, it may involve other neurotransmitter systems such as the noradrenergic, serotonergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic systems as well. Depression can result from any unhealthy conditions making the diagnosis a challenging task. The manifestation of depression associated with or without PD is inadequate. The co-occurrence of depression and PD often leads to the conceptual discussion on whether depressive symptoms appear before or after PD develops. This paper will discuss the conceptual mechanism of PD and depression. Keep in mind both conditions belong to two separate entities but share some similar aspects in their pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "The current process used to diagnose cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is unsatisfactory. More and more researchers had introduced machine learning into this field in recent years. This study explored the application of machine learning and its diagnostic performance in this field.\nSince Parkinson's concurrent cognitive impairment is currently divided into different periods, most studies focus on the prodromal or early stages of Parkinson's cognitive impairment, and a few focuses on the dementia stage of Parkinson's. To ensure comprehensiveness, and model stability, we included patients with Parkinson's concurrent cognitive impairment in different periods who met the nadir criteria. A comprehensive literature search was carried out of the PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases. We used Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) to assess the risk of bias for the machine learning models covered by the included original studies. The outcome indicators included the concordance-index (C-index), sensitivity, and specificity. A meta-analysis using the random-effects model was conducted to determine the C-index, and a double variable mixed-effects model was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity. The meta-analysis in this article was completed in STATA.\nA total of 32 articles, comprising 10,778 patients and 51 prognostic models [summary c-statistic: 0.857, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.842-0.873)], met the selection criteria and were included in this analysis. The total sensitivity and specificity of all models were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.72-0.81) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.80-0.85), respectively, and those of the testing test were 0.85 (95% CI: 0.79-0.89), and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.70-0.78), respectively. A large part of the model showed a high risk of bias mainly because the study design was almost retrospective investigation.\nThis study constitutes a detailed mapping and assessment of the machine learning for prediction in PD patients with cognitive decline, which may provide stronger discriminative performance and can be used as a potential tool for early diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "There is no consensus on the efficacy of using \u03b1-synuclein as the primary immunotherapy site for Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study sought to investigate the safety and effectiveness of \u03b1-synuclein immunotherapy for treating PD.\nThe databases of CNKI, CBM, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Cochrane Collaboration's bias assessment tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included articles, and the included PD patients older than 18 years adopted immunotherapy. Stata 15.0 was employed for statistical analysis.\nA total of 6 RCTs were eligible for the present study, involving 606 immunotherapy recipients (using alpha-synuclein immunotherapy) and 254 control individuals (placebo). Our meta-analysis found no statistical difference in the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) total score [weighted mean difference (WMD): -0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.56 to 0.13, P=0.099], adverse event incidence [relative risk (RR): 1.06, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.15, P=0.150], headache incidence (RR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.34, P=0.773), and constipation incidence (RR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.77 to 2.78, P=0.242). However, the infection rate in the immunotherapy group was higher than in the control group (RR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.40 to 3.74, P=0.003). The above results indicate that immunotherapy is significantly different from placebo in MDS-UPDRS and adverse event incidence, but it can reduce the incidence of infection rate.\nExisting results showed that \u03b1-synuclein immunotherapy had no significant effect on PD. high-quality, multi-center, and large-scale clinical studies are desired to corroborate our findings.",

Our meta-analysis found no statistical difference in the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) total score [weighted mean difference (WMD): -0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.56 to 0.13, P=0.099], adverse event incidence [relative risk (RR): 1.06, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.15, P=0.150], headache incidence (RR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.34, P=0.773), and constipation incidence (RR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.77 to 2.78, P=0.242). However, the infection rate in the immunotherapy group was higher than in the control group (RR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.40 to 3.74, P=0.003). The above results indicate that immunotherapy is significantly different from placebo in MDS-UPDRS and adverse event incidence, but it can reduce the incidence of infection rate.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies show correlations between constipation and development of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, few studies have explored the association between constipation and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). We sought to explore the lifelong association of constipation and PD, DLB, PDD, and MSA (\u03b1-Synucleinopathies), compared to age- and sex-matched controls.\nUsing the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), we established an incident cohort of clinically defined \u03b1-synucleinopathies. A movement-disorder specialist reviewed all medical charts to establish clinical diagnoses.\nWe identified 453 incident cases of clinically diagnosed \u03b1-synucleinopathies and an identical number of age- and sex-matched controls in Olmsted County (MN), 1991-2010. There were 303 cases of PD; 80, DLB; 54, PDD; and 16, MSA. Approximately 50% of \u03b1-synucleinopathies of all types reported constipation, compared to 27% in controls. The earliest pre-motor onset constipation was in DLB (median, 3.76 years prior to \u03b1-synucleinopathies motor-symptom onset); latest onset post-motor constipation was in PD (median, 5.15 years after motor-symptom onset). PD also had the highest longstanding constipation rate (18.2%). All \u03b1-synucleinopathies had higher odds of constipation compared to controls, except for MSA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.09), likely due to a limited sample size.\nPD, DLB, and PDD had higher odds of constipation compared to controls; PD had the most widespread onset of lifelong constipation, both longstanding and pre- or post-motor onset symptoms. Our results indicate that constipation rates do not differ among \u03b1-synucleinopathies but do differ in terms of temporal onset compared to disease onset.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most disabling symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), contributing to poor quality of life and increased risk of falls. Wearable sensors represent a valuable means for detecting FOG in the home environment. Moreover, real-time feedback has proven to help reduce the duration of FOG episodes. This work proposes a robust real-time FOG detection algorithm, which is easy to implement in stand-alone devices working in non-supervised conditions.\nData from three different data sets were used in this study, with two employed as independent test sets. Acceleration recordings from 118 PD patients and 21 healthy elderly subjects were collected while they performed simulated daily living activities. A single inertial sensor was attached to the waist of each subject. More than 17 h of valid data and a total number of 1110 FOG episodes were analyzed in this study. The implemented algorithm consisted of a multi-head convolutional neural network, which exploited different spatial resolutions in the analysis of inertial data. The architecture and the model parameters were designed to provide optimal performance while reducing computational complexity and testing time.\nThe developed algorithm demonstrated good to excellent classification performance, with more than 50% (30%) of FOG episodes predicted on average 3.1\u00a0s (1.3\u00a0s) before the actual onset in the main (independent) data set. Around 50% of FOG was detected with an average delay of 0.8\u00a0s (1.1\u00a0s) in the main (independent) data set. Moreover, a specificity above 88% (93%) was obtained when testing the algorithm on the main (independent) test set, while 100% specificity was obtained on healthy elderly subjects.\nThe algorithm proved robust, with low computational complexity and processing time, thus paving the way to a real-time implementation in a stand-alone device that can be used in non-supervised environments.",

    "abstract": "The use of exergaming exercises is increasingly becoming accepted as an alternative to surgical and medical therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the area has attracted some results, there is still no conclusive evidence on the benefit of exergaming exercises in improving PD patients' body balance. The current study is a systematic review aiming at examining the effectiveness of the Nintendo Wii Fit (\"Wii Fit\") game on improving the balance in people with Parkinson's disease. A total of 200 articles were selected online after conducting an extensive search on PubMed, Cochrane, PEDro, CAPES Periodic, ResearchGate, Web of Science, and ProQuest. Upon reviewing the identified sources, ten articles were included, of which four were randomized control trials. The results show that at least five weeks of Wii Fit exercises effectively enhance PD patients' body balance and life outcomes. However, better results occur when patients combine Wii Fit with other conventional exercises.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) has been widely recognized and supported in recent literature. Prospective and retrospective studies found non-motor symptoms within the GI, specifically constipation, precede cardinal signs and cognitive decline by almost 20 years. In 2002, Braak et al. were the first to propose that PD is a six-stage propagating neuropathological process originating from the GI tract (GIT). Aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) protein from the GIT is pathognomonic for the development of PD. This article reviews the current literature from the past 10 years as well as original research found in PubMed on the combined effects of enteric glial cells and lectins on the development of Parkinson's Disease. Studies have found that these aggregated and phosphorylated proteins gain access to the brain via retrograde transport through fast and slow fibers of intestinal neurons. Plant lectins, commonly found within plant-based diets, have been found to induce Leaky Gut Syndrome and can activate enteric glial cells, causing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Oxidative stress on the enteric neurons, caused by a chronic neuro-inflammatory state, can cause a-syn aggregation and lead to Lewy Body formation, a hallmark finding in PD. Although the current literature provides a connection between the consumption of plant lectins and the pathophysiology of PD, further research is required to evaluate confounding variables such as food antigen mimicry and other harmful substances found in our diets.",

    "abstract": "Although the pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) is not completely understood, there is a consensus that it can be caused by multifactorial mechanisms involving genetic susceptibility, epigenetic modifications induced by toxins and mitochondrial dysfunction. In the past 20 years, great efforts have been made in order to clarify molecular mechanisms that are risk factors for this disease, as well as to identify bioactive agents for prevention and slowing down of its progression. Nutraceutical products have received substantial interest due to their nutritional, safe and therapeutic effects on several chronic diseases. The aim of this review was to gather the main evidence of the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effects of phenolic compounds currently under investigation for the treatment of toxin-induced PD. These studies confirm that the neuroprotective actions of polyphenols involve complex epigenetic modulations, demonstrating that the intake of these natural compounds can be a promising, low-cost, pharmacogenomic strategy against the development of PD.",

There is lack of knowledge regarding the predictive value of cognition for changes in walking performance after individualized therapy. The aim of this study is to identify relevant predictive cognitive and affective parameters, measurable in daily clinical routines, for change in quantitative walking performance after early geriatric rehabilitation.\nForty-seven acutely hospitalized patients with advanced PD were assessed at baseline (T1) and at the end (T2) of a 2-week early rehabilitative geriatric complex treatment (ERGCT). Global cognitive performance (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA), EF and divided attention (Trail Making Test B minus A, delta TMT), depressive symptoms, and fear of falling were assessed at T1. Change in walking performance was determined by the difference in quantitative walking parameters extracted from a sensor-based movement analysis over 20\u2009m straight walking in single (ST, fast and normal pace) and dual task (DT, with secondary cognitive, respectively, motor task) conditions between T1 and T2. Bayesian regression (using Bayes Factor BF\nUnder ST, there was moderate evidence (BF\nOur results indicate that the effect of ERGT on change in walking performance is limited for patients with deficits in EF and divided attention. However, these patients also seem to walk more cautiously after treatment in walking situations with additional cognitive demand.

    "abstract": "The protein p53 is the main human tumor suppressor. Since its discovery, extensive research has been conducted, which led to the general assumption that the purview of p53 is also essential for additional functions, apart from the prevention of carcinogenesis. In response to cellular stress and DNA damages, p53 constitutes the key point for the induction of various regulatory processes, determining whether the cell induces cell cycle arrest and DNA repair mechanisms or otherwise cell death. As an implication, aberrations from its normal functioning can lead to pathogeneses. To this day, neurodegenerative diseases are considered difficult to treat, which arises from the fact that in general the underlying pathological mechanisms are not well understood. Current research on brain and retina-related neurodegenerative disorders suggests that p53 plays an essential role in the progression of these conditions as well. In this review, we therefore compare the role and similarities of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), two of the most prevalent neurological diseases, to the age-related macular degeneration (AMD) which is among the most common forms of retinal degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common disabling motor disturbance in Parkinson's disease (PD). Our study aimed to probe the topological organizations of structural and functional brain networks and their coupling in FOG.\nIn this cross-sectional retrospective study, a total of 30 PD patients with FOG (PD-FOG), 40 patients without FOG, and 25 healthy controls (HCs) underwent clinical assessments and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Large-scale structural and functional brain networks were constructed. Subsequently, global and nodal graph theoretical properties and functional-structural coupling were investigated. Finally, correlations between the altered brain topological properties and freezing severity were analyzed in PD-FOG.\nFor structural networks, at the global level, PD-FOG exhibited increased normalized characteristic path length (P=0.040, Bonferroni-corrected) and decreased global efficiency (P=0.005, Bonferroni-corrected) compared with controls, and showed reduced global (P=0.001, Bonferroni-corrected) and local (P=0.032, Bonferroni-corrected) efficiency relative to patients without FOG. At the nodal level, nodal efficiency of structural networks was reduced in PD-FOG compared with PD patients without FOG, located in the left supplementary motor area (SMA), gyrus rectus, and middle cingulate cortex (MCC) (all P<0.05, Bonferroni-corrected). Notably, altered global and nodal properties of structural networks were significantly correlated with Freezing of Gait Questionnaire scores [all P<0.05, false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected]. However, only an increase in local efficiency (P=0.003, Bonferroni-corrected) of functional networks was identified in PD-FOG compared with those without FOG. No significant structural-functional coupling was detected among the 3 groups.\nThis study demonstrates the extensively impaired structural and relatively reserved functional network topological organizations in PD-FOG. Our results also provide evidence that the pathogenesis of PD-FOG is primarily attributable to network vulnerability established by crucial structural damage, especially in the left SMA, gyrus rectus, and MCC.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PwP) have face recognition difficulties.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the difficulties of PwP in recognizing masked faces during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA total of 64 PwP, 58 age-matched older healthy controls (OHCs), and 61 younger healthy controls (YHCs) were included in the study. The Benton Face Recognition Test - short form (BFRT-sf) and the 13-item questionnaire on face recognition difficulties due to masks during the pandemic developed by the authors were applied to all three study groups.\nBoth the PwP and OHC groups scored worse in BFRT-sf when compared with the YHC group (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). The number of those who had difficulty in recognizing people seen every day and the number of those who asked people to remove their masks because they did not recognize them were higher in the PWP group (p=0.026 and p=0.002, respectively). The number of individuals who looked at the posture and gait of people when they did not recognize their masked faces and those who stated that this difficulty affected their daily lives were higher in the OHC group (p=0.002 and p=0.009, respectively). The number of participants whose difficulty in recognizing masked faces decreased over time was higher in the YHC group (p=0.003).\nThe PwP group demonstrated similar performance to their peers but differed from the YHC group in recognizing masked faces. Knowing difficulties experienced by elderly people in recognizing people who are masked can increase awareness on this issue and enhance their social interaction in pandemic conditions through measures to be taken.\nPacientes com doen\u00e7a de Parkinson (PcP) t\u00eam dificuldades de reconhecimento facial.\nAvaliamos as dificuldades de PcP em reconhecer rostos mascarados durante a pandemia de COVID-19.\nInclu\u00edmos 64 PcP, 58 controles saud\u00e1veis \u200b\u200bmais velhos (CSVs) pareados por idade, 61 controles saud\u00e1veis mais jovens (CSJs) no estudo.

    "abstract": "Cannabis has been proposed as a potential treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) due to its neuroprotective benefits. However, there has been no rigorous review of preclinical studies to evaluate any potential treatment effect. This systematic review was undertaken to provide evidence in support or against a treatment effect of cannabinoids in animal models of PD.\nDatabases were searched for any controlled comparative studies that assessed the effects of any cannabinoid, cannabinoid-based treatment or endocannabinoid transport blocker on behavioural symptoms in PD animal models.\nA total of 41 studies were identified to have met the criteria for this review. 14 of these studies were included in meta-analyses of rotarod, pole and open field tests. Meta-analysis of rotarod tests showed a weighted mean difference of 31.63\u2009s for cannabinoid-treated group compared with control. Meta-analysis of pole tests also showed a positive treatment effect, evidenced by a weighted mean difference of -1.51\u2009s for cannabinoid treat group compared with control. However, meta-analysis of open field test demonstrated a standardised mean difference of only 0.36 indicating no benefit.\nThis review demonstrates cannabinoid treatment effects in alleviating motor symptoms of PD animal models and supports the conduct of clinical trials of cannabis in PD population. However, there is no guarantee of successful clinical translation of this outcome because of the many variables that might have affected the results, such as the prevalent unclear and high risk of bias, the different study methods, PD animal models and cannabinoids used.",

    "abstract": "We tested the feasibility of one session of treadmill training using a novel physical therapist assisted system (Mobility Rehab) using wearable sensors on the upper and lower limbs of 10 people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Participants performed a 2-min walk overground before and after 15 min of treadmill training with Mobility Rehab, which included an electronic tablet (to visualize gait metrics) and five Opal sensors placed on both the wrists and feet and on the sternum area to measure gait and provide feedback on six gait metrics (foot-strike angle, trunk coronal range-of-motion (ROM), arm swing ROM, double-support duration, gait-cycle duration, and step asymmetry). The physical therapist used Mobility Rehab to select one or two gait metrics (from the six) to focus on during the treadmill training. Foot-strike angle (effect size (ES) = 0.56, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.14 to 0.97), trunk coronal RoM (ES = 1.39, 95% CI = 0.73 to 2.06), and arm swing RoM (ES = 1.64, 95% CI = 0.71 to 2.58) during overground walking showed significant and moderate-to-large ES following treadmill training with Mobility Rehab. Participants perceived moderate (60%) and excellent (30%) effects of Mobility Rehab on their gait. No adverse events were reported. One session of treadmill training with Mobility Rehab is feasible for people with mild-to-moderate PD.",

    "abstract": "Selenium (Se), an essential antioxidant trace element, is reported to play a role in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there is a lack of systematic studies on different Se forms against PD. Our study is designed to compare the neuroprotective effects of inorganic and organic Se in two classical PD mice models and investigate the underlying mechanisms for their potentially differential actions against PD. In this study, different dosages of inorganic sodium selenite (Se-Na) or organic seleno-L-methionine (Se-Met) were fed to either acute or chronic PD mice models, and their neuroprotective effects and mechanisms were explored and compared. Se-Na provided better neuroprotective effects in PD mice than Se-Met administered at the same but at a relatively low Se dosage. Se-Na treatment could influence GPX activities but not their mRNA expressions in the midbrains of PD mice. The enhanced GPX activities caused by Se-Na, but not Se-Met, in PD mice could be the major reason for the positive actions of inorganic Se to prevent dopaminergic neuronal loss in this study. ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, leading to impairment of various neurological faculties, including motor, planning, cognitivity, and executive functions. Motor- and non-motor symptoms of the disease may intensify a patient's restrictions to performing usual tasks of daily living, including driving. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) associated with optimized clinical treatment has been shown to improve quality of life, motor, and non-motor symptoms in PD. In most countries, there are no specific guidelines concerning minimum safety requirements and the timing of return to driving following DBS, leaving to the medical staff of individual DBS centres the responsibility to draw recommendations individually regarding patients' ability to drive after surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate factors that might influence the ability to drive following DBS in the management of PD. A total of 125 patients were included. Clinical, epidemiological, neuropsychological, and surgical factors were evaluated. The mean follow-up time was 129.9 months. DBS improved motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. However, in general, patients were 2.8-fold less likely to drive in the postoperative period than prior to surgery. Among the PD characteristics, patients with the akinetic subtype presented a higher risk to lose their driving licence postoperatively. Furthermore, the presence of an abnormal postoperative neuropsychological evaluation was also associated with driving restriction following surgery. Our data indicate that restriction to drive following surgery seems to be multifactorial rather than a direct consequence of DBS itself. Our study sheds light on the urgent need for a standardised multidisciplinary postoperative evaluation to assess patients' ability to drive following DBS.",

    "abstract": "Evidence supports the view that postural sway in a quiet stance increases with clinical disease severity and dopaminergic therapy in idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), which, in turn, increases the risk of falling. This study evaluated the feasibility of combining disease-specific and balance-related measures as risk predictors for future falls in patients with PD. The patients with PD underwent postural sway measurements (area, length, and velocity traveled by the excursion of the center of pressure) and clinical functional scores (Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] and Tinetti balance and gait score assessment) in both the on- and off-states of dopaminergic therapy. The outcome was defined as the development of a new fall. The sway area, velocity, and length increased after the medication administration. The Cox proportional hazards model showed that only previous fall history, Tinetti balance and gait score (on-state), and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) were associated with the development of future falls. The cumulative risk of fall development showed that the sway length and velocity were associated with future falls after more than six months. The combined LEDD, Tinetti balance and gait score (on-state), and velocity and length of postural sway (on-state) had the highest diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve = 0.9, p < 0.0001). Dopaminergic therapy can improve clinical functional scores but worsen balance-related measures. Increased sway length and velocity during the medication state are hallmarks of future falls, particularly in advanced PD. Combining disease-specific and balance-related measures can serve as an auxiliary diagnosis as risk predictors for future falls.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative synucleinopathy that has a not yet fully understood molecular pathomechanism behind it. The role of risk genes regulated by small non-coding RNAs, or microRNAs (miRNAs), has also been highlighted in PD, where they may influence disease progression and comorbidities. In this case-control study, we analyzed miRNAs on peripheral blood mononuclear cells by means of RNA-seq in 30 participants, with the aim of identifying miRNAs differentially expressed in PD compared to age-matched healthy controls. Additionally, we investigated the pathways influenced by differentially expressed miRNAs and assessed whether a specific pathway could potentially be associated with PD susceptibility (enrichment analyses performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tools). Overall, considering that the upregulation of miRNAs might be related with the downregulation of their messenger RNA targets, and vice versa, we found several putative targets of dysregulated miRNAs (i.e., upregulated: hsa-miR-1275, hsa-miR-23a-5p, hsa-miR-432-5p, hsa-miR-4433b-3p, and hsa-miR-4443; downregulated: hsa-miR-142-5p, hsa-miR-143-3p, hsa-miR-374a-3p, hsa-miR-542-3p, and hsa-miR-99a-5p). An inverse connection between cancer and neurodegeneration, called \"inverse comorbidity\", has also been noted, showing that some genes or miRNAs may be expressed oppositely in neurodegenerative disorders and in some cancers. Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider these miRNAs as potential diagnostic markers and outcome measures.",

    "abstract": "The fight against neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), is among the global challenges of the 21st century. The low efficiency of therapy is due to the late diagnosis and treatment of PD, which take place when there is already significant degradation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, a key link in the regulation of motor function. We have developed a subchronic mouse model of PD by repeatedly administering 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) at gradually increasing doses with a 24 h interval between injections, a period comparable to the time of MPTP metabolism and elimination from the body. This model reproduces the main hallmarks of PD: progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons; the appearance of motor disorders with a 70-80% decrease in the level of dopamine in the striatum; an increase in dopamine turnover in the striatum to compensate for dopamine deficiency. When comparing the degradation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and motor disorders in mice in the acute and subchronic models of PD, it has turned out that the resistance of dopaminergic neurons to MPTP increases with its repeated administration. Our subchronic model of PD opens up broad prospects for studying the molecular mechanisms of PD pathogenesis and developing technologies for early diagnosis and preventive treatment.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Increasing evidence supports that PD is not simply a motor disorder but a systemic disease leading to motor and non-motor symptoms, including memory loss and neuropsychiatric conditions, with poor management of the non-motor deficits by the existing dopaminergic medication. Oxidative stress is considered a contributing factor for nigrostriatal degeneration, while antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties of natural phyto-polyphenols have been suggested to have beneficial effects. The present study aimed to determine the contribution of monoaminergic neurotransmission on the anxiety-like phenotype in a rat rotenone PD model and evaluate the possible neuroprotective effects of black Corinthian currant, ",

    "abstract": "One of the major mediators of neuroinflammation in PD is tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), which, similar to other cytokines, is produced by activated microglia and astrocytes. Although TNF-\u03b1 can be neuroprotective in the brain, long-term neuroinflammation and TNF release can be harmful, having a neurotoxic role that leads to death of oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons and, therefore, is associated with neurodegeneration. Apart from cytokines, a wide family of molecules with homologous structures, namely chemokines, play a key role in neuro-inflammation by drawing cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and activating microglia. The objective of the current study was to examine the levels of the serum TNF-\u03b1 and CCL2 (Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2), also known as MCP-1 (Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1), in PD patients compared with healthy controls. We also investigated the associations between the serum levels of these two inflammatory mediators and a number of clinical symptoms, in particular, disease severity and cognition. Such an assessment may point to their prognostic value and provide some treatment hints. PD patients with advanced stage on the Hoehn-Yahr scale showed an increase in TNF-\u03b1 levels compared with PD patients with stages 1 and 2 (",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, diagnosed on the basis of typical motor disturbances, but also characterized by the presence of non-motor symptoms, such as rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep behavior disorders, olfactory impairment, and constipation, which are often prodromal to the onset of the disease. PD is often associated with the presence of oxidative brain injury and chronic neuroinflammation, with infiltration and accumulation of peripheral immune cells that have been found in affected brain regions of PD patients. Recently, the role of the gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of PD is getting more and more attention, and several pieces of evidence indicate alterations in the gut microbiota of PD-affected patients. Diet exerts a central role in defining the microbiota composition and different dietetic patterns can result in a higher or lower abundance of specific bacteria that, in turn, can affect gut permeability and express anti- or pro-inflammatory metabolites. In the present review, the effects of the Mediterranean diet in modulating both PD onset and its progression will be considered with a special focus on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of this dietetic regimen as well as on its effects on the microbiota composition.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are extensively edited in human brains. However, the functional relevance of the miRNA editome is largely unknown in Parkinson's disease (PD). By analyzing small RNA sequencing profiles of brain tissues of 43 PD patients and 88 normal controls, we found that the editing levels of five A-to-I and two C-to-U editing sites are significantly correlated with the ages of normal controls, which is disrupted in PD patients. We totally identified 362 miRNA editing sites with significantly different editing levels in prefrontal cortices of PD patients (PD-PC) compared to results of normal controls. We experimentally validated that A-to-I edited miR-497-5p, with significantly higher expression levels in PD-PC compared to normal controls, directly represses OPA1 and VAPB. Furthermore, overexpression of A-to-I edited miR-497-5p downregulates OPA1 and VAPB in two cell lines, and inhibits proliferation of glioma cells. These results suggest that the hyperediting of miR-497-5p in PD contributes to enhanced progressive neurodegeneration of PD patients. Our results provide new insights into the mechanistic understanding, novel diagnostics, and therapeutic clues of PD.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) is a frequent parkinsonian syndrome that appears as a result of pharmacotherapy for the management of psychosis. It could substantially hamper treatment and therefore its diagnosis has a direct influence on treatment effectiveness. Although of such high importance, there is a lack of systematic research for developing neuroimaging-based criteria for DIP diagnostics for such patients. Therefore, the current study was aimed at applying a metabolic brain imaging approach using the 18F-FDG positron emission tomography and spatial covariance analysis to reveal possible candidates for DIP markers. As a result, we demonstrated, to our knowledge, the first attempt at the application of the Parkinson's Disease-Related Pattern (PDRP) as a metabolic signature of parkinsonism for the assessment of PDRP expression for schizophrenia patients with DIP. As a result, we observed significant differences in PDRP expression between the control group and the groups with PD and DIP patients. Similar differences in PDRP expression were also found when the non-DIP schizophrenia patients were compared with the PD group. Therefore, our findings made it possible to conclude that PDRP is a promising tool for the development of clinically relevant criteria for the estimation of the risk of developing DIP.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the inability to initiate stepping, despite the intention to do so. This study used a startling acoustic stimulus paradigm to examine if the capacity to select, prepare and initiate gait under simple and choice reaction time conditions are impaired in people with PD and FOG.\nThirty individuals (10 PD with FOG, 10 PD without FOG, and 10 controls) performed an instructed-delay gait initiation task under simple and choice reaction time conditions. In a subset of trials, a startle stimulus (124\u00a0dB) was presented 500\u00a0ms before the time of the imperative go-cue. Anticipatory postural adjustments preceding and accompanying gait initiation were quantified.\nThe presentation of a startling acoustic stimulus resulted in the rapid initiation of an anticipatory postural adjustment sequence during both the simple and choice reaction time tasks in all groups.\nThe neural capacity to prepare the spatial and temporal components of gait initiation remains intact in PD individuals with and without FOG.\nThe retained capacity to prepare anticipatory postural adjustments in advance may explain why external sensory cues are effective in the facilitation of gait initiation in people with PD with FOG.",

    "abstract": "To better understand the development of dysphagia in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and to identify possible neuromodulatory target regions of dysphagia, we studied the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability distribution by subtype of dysphagia.\nIn this retrospective cross-sectional study, patients with PD who underwent videofluoroscopic swallowing study and N-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-2\u03b2-carbon ethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (18F-FP-CIT) PET at intervals of less than 1 month were analyzed. The 14 binarized subitem scores of the Videofluoroscopic Dysphagia Scale were analyzed using a voxel-wise Firth's penalized binary logistic regression model, adjusting for age and disease duration at videofluoroscopic swallowing study.\nSixty-five patients with PD were finally included. Striatal mapping showed association of decreased DAT availability with 5 subitems with 1 or more clusters surviving the statistical threshold: 1 oral phase and 4 pharyngeal phase subitems. The overlap maps created by superimposing clusters for all 5 statistically significant subitems revealed associations of dysphagia in PD with decreased DAT availability in the bilateral ventral striatum. Of these, 4 subitems belonging to the pharyngeal phase-specific dysphagia were additionally found to be related to dopaminergic degeneration of the bilateral anterior-to-posterior caudate and ventral striatum.\nThese findings suggest that subitem/phase-specific striatal subregional dopaminergic depletion may explain the dysphagia of PD. This dopaminergic degeneration of striatal subregions specific to the phases of dysphagia may serve as a potential target for neuromodulatory brain stimulation through stimulation of cortices functionally connected.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to explore the neuroprotective effect of cinnamaldehyde(CA) in mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine(MPTP)-induced subacute Parkinson's disease(PD) and the mechanism. To be specific, male C57 BL/6 mice(n=72, SPF) were randomized into control group, model group, positive control(madopar 0.1 mg\u00b7g~(-1)) group, and low-dose, me-dium-dose, and high-dose CA groups(0.15, 0.30, 0.60 mg\u00b7g~(-1)). MPTP(intraperitoneal injection, 0.03 mg\u00b7g~(-1), once a day for 5 days) was used to induce subacute PD in mice except for the control group. The administration began from the day of modeling and lasted 19 days. On the 0 th, 12 th, and 19 th day, the open field test, pole test, and rotarod test were carried out. After the tests, the mice were killed and brains were separated. In addition, the organ index was measured. The number of cells in substantia nigra(SN) in the midbrain of MPTP-induced PD model mice was detected based on hematoxylin and eosin(HE) staining. The levels of tyrosine hydroxylase(TH)-and \u03b1-synuclein(\u03b1-Syn)-positive cells in SN were determined by immunohistochemical staining, and the protein levels of TH and \u03b1-Syn in SN by Western blot. The results showed that the MPTP-stimulated mice had abnormal behaviors such as erect hair, arched back, rigidity of the tail, slow movement, and tremor, decreased number of crossings and rearing, increased frequency of urination and defecation, longer time of pole climbing, and shorter time of staying on the rotating rod. In addition, the mice showed obvious damage of neurons in the SN and reduced neuron cells in irregular arrangement with some shrinking. In addition, the average optical density of TH in SN decreased and that of \u03b1-Syn increased. All these suggested the successful modeling. CA displayed obvious therapeutic effect on the PD mice, as manifested by the increased number of crossings and rearing, decreased frequency of urination and defecation, shorter time of climbing pole, longer time of staying on the rotating rod, and more neuron cells in the SN with a few pykno-tic cells. Moreover, CA significantly alleviated the decrease of TH and the overexpression of \u03b1-Syn in SN. As a result, the MPTP-induced injury of dopaminergic neurons was alleviated. The performance of 0.3 mg\u00b7g~(-1) CA was the best. This study is expected to lay a scientific basis for the development of CA products.",

    "abstract": "Visual hallucinations are common in Parkinson's disease and are associated with a poorer quality of life and a higher risk of dementia. An important and influential model that is widely accepted as an explanation for the mechanism of visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease and other Lewy body diseases is that these arise due to aberrant hierarchical processing, with impaired bottom-up integration of sensory information and overweighting of top-down perceptual priors within the visual system. This hypothesis has been driven by behavioural data and supported indirectly by observations derived from regional activation and correlational measures using neuroimaging. However, until now, there was no evidence from neuroimaging for differences in causal influences between brain regions measured in patients with Parkinson's hallucinations. This is in part because previous resting-state studies focused on functional connectivity, which is inherently undirected in nature and cannot test hypotheses about the directionality of connectivity. Spectral dynamic causal modelling is a Bayesian framework that allows the inference of effective connectivity-defined as the directed (causal) influence that one region exerts on another region-from resting-state functional MRI data. In the current study, we utilize spectral dynamic causal modelling to estimate effective connectivity within the resting-state visual network in our cohort of 15 Parkinson's disease visual hallucinators and 75 Parkinson's disease non-visual hallucinators. We find that visual hallucinators display decreased bottom-up effective connectivity from the lateral geniculate nucleus to primary visual cortex and increased top-down effective connectivity from the left prefrontal cortex to primary visual cortex and the medial thalamus, as compared with non-visual hallucinators. Importantly, we find that the pattern of effective connectivity is predictive of the presence of visual hallucinations and associated with their severity within the hallucinating group. This is the first study to provide evidence, using resting-state effective connectivity, to support a model of aberrant hierarchical predictive processing as the mechanism for visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Simulated whole-brain connectomes demonstrate enhanced inter-individual variability depending on the data processing and modelling approach. By considering the human brain connectome as an individualized attribute, we investigate how empirical and simulated whole-brain connectome-derived features can be utilized to classify patients with Parkinson's disease against healthy controls in light of varying data processing and model validation. To this end, we applied simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent signals derived by a whole-brain dynamical model simulating electrical signals of neuronal populations to reveal differences between patients and controls. In addition to the widely used model validation via fitting the dynamical model to empirical neuroimaging data, we invented a model validation against behavioural data, such as subject classes, which we refer to as behavioural model fitting and show that it can be beneficial for Parkinsonian patient classification. Furthermore, the results of machine learning reported in this study also demonstrated that the performance of the patient classification can be improved when the empirical data are complemented by the simulation results. We also showed that the temporal filtering of blood oxygenation level-dependent signals influences the prediction results, where filtering in the low-frequency band is advisable for Parkinsonian patient classification. In addition, composing the feature space of empirical and simulated data from multiple brain parcellation schemes provided complementary features that improved prediction performance. Based on our findings, we suggest that combining the simulation results with empirical data is effective for inter-individual research and its clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Next to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease constitutes the second most widespread neurological disorder, primarily affecting the older population. Its symptoms are noticeable with advancing age including tremors, postural imbalance, and slow movements, and over time, these symptoms get aggravated, progressing to osteoporosis, osteopenia, and risk of fractures. These symptoms correlate to low bone density and hence weakened bones; thus, vitamin D proves to be an intricate component of the pathogenesis of the disease. Moreover, lower serum concentrations of vitamin D have been found in diseased subjects. Supplementation with vitamin D can retard the aggravation of non-motor as well as motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease that include cognitive improvement along with the decline in risk of fractures. Also, vitamin D is extremely crucial for brain functioning, targeting dopaminergic neurons, and almost the entire functioning of the brain is affected. However, further exploration is required to determine the toxic dose of vitamin D in Parkinson's subjects. This \"sunshine vitamin\" surely can be a ray of sunshine for neurologically diseased subjects.",

The goals of the present study were to compare the severity of anxiety, apathy, and depressive symptoms in PD, ET, and healthy controls (HC) and to examine differential relationships between mood and cognition.\nOlder adults with idiopathic PD (\nRelative to the HC group, the PD and ET groups reported more mood symptoms and scored lower across all cognitive measures. There were no differences between the two movement disorder groups. Mood variables explained 3.9-13.7% of the total variance in cognitive domains, varying by disease group. For PD, apathy was the only unique predictor of executive function (\nIn a large cohort of ET and PD, we observed that the two groups had similar self-reported mood symptoms. Mood symptoms were differentially associated with cognition in PD versus ET. In PD, increased apathy was associated with worse executive function and higher trait anxiety predicted worse attention/working memory. For ET, there were no unique predictors, though the overall mood symptom severity was related to cognition. Our study highlights the importance of considering the relationship between mood and neuropsychological performance in individuals with movement disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common irreversible neurodegenerative disease associated with cognitive impairment. To investigate the serum level of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and the distribution of the genotypes and alleles of 3 PI3K single-nucleotide polymorphisms (RS37,30,087, RS37,30,088, and RS37,30,089) in PD patients with different clinical characteristics. A total of 54 PD patients and 50 healthy individuals were recruited. The serum PI3K level was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The severity of PD was assessed using the modified Hoehn-Yahr scale. The cognitive function of PD patients was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination scale and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The distribution of the alleles and genotypes of PI3K single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. PD patients showed a significantly higher serum level of PI3K compared to healthy individuals. Increased serum PI3K level was observed in PD patients with more severe disease, longer disease duration, and impaired cognitive function. Additionally, no significant differences were observed in the distributions of the genotypes and alleles of 3 PI3K SNPs between PD patients with normal cognitive function and those with cognitive impairment. PD patients with different levels of disease severity, disease duration, and cognitive function had significantly different serum levels of PI3K. However, the PI3K SNPs in patients with normal cognitive function were not significantly different from those in patients with cognitive impairment. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the roles of PI3K and SNPs of the PI3K gene in PD.",

    "abstract": "Carbidopa/levodopa enteral suspension (CLES) previously demonstrated reduction in total daily OFF from baseline by over 4\u00a0hours in advanced Parkinson's disease patients across 54\u00a0weeks. Evidence on CLES's long-term effectiveness on patterns of motor-symptom control throughout the day remains limited.\nWe present post-hoc analyses of a large, open-label study of CLES monotherapy (N\u00a0=\u00a0289). Diary data recorded patients' motor states at 30-minute intervals over 3\u00a0days at baseline and weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 54. Adjusted generalized linear mixed models assessed changes from baseline at each timepoint for four outcome measures: time to ON without troublesome dyskinesia (ON-woTD) after waking, motor-symptom control as measured by motor states' durations throughout the day, number of motor-state transitions, and presence of extreme fluctuations (OFF to ON with TD).\nPatients demonstrated short-term (wk4) and sustained (wk54) improvement in all outcomes compared to baseline. At weeks 4 and 54, patients were more likely to reach ON-woTD over the course of their day (HR: 1.86 and 2.51, both P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Across 4-hour intervals throughout the day, patients also experienced increases in ON-woTD (wk4: 58-65\u00a0min; wk54: 60-78 min; all P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and reductions in OFF (wk4: 50-61 min; wk54: 56-68 min; all P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). At weeks 4 and 54, patients' motor-state transitions were reduced by about half (IRR: 0.53 and 0.49, both P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and fewer patients experienced extreme fluctuations (OR: 0.22 and 0.15, both P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).\nCLES monotherapy was associated with significant long-term reductions in motor-state fluctuations, faster time to ON-woTD upon awakening, and increased symptom control throughout the day.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders characterized by motor and nonmotor symptoms due to the selective loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Pharmacological and surgical interventions have not been possible to cure PD; however, the cause of neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we performed and tested a multitiered bioinformatic analysis using the GEO and Proteinexchange database to investigate the gene expression involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Then we further validated individual differences in gene expression in whole blood samples that we collected in the clinic. We also made an interaction analysis and prediction for these genetic factors. There were in all 1045 genes expressing differently in PD compared with the healthy control group. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks showed 10 top hub genes: ACO2, MDH2, SDHA, ATP5A1, UQCRC2, PDHB, SUCLG1, NDUFS3, UQCRC1, and ATP5C1. We validated the ten hub gene expression in clinical PD patients and showed the expression of MDH2 was significantly different compared with healthy control. Besides, we also identified the expression of G6PD, GRID2, RIPK2, CUL4B, BCL6, MRPS31, GPI, and MAP 2\u2009K1 were all significantly increased, and levels of MAPK, ELAVL1, RAB14, KLF9, ARF1, ARFGAP1, ATG7, ABCA7, SFT2D2, E2F2, MAPK7, and UHRF1 were all significantly decreased in PD. Among them, to our knowledge, we presently have the most recent and conclusive evidence that GRID2, RIPK2, CUL4B, E2F2, and ABCA7 are possible PD indicators. We confirmed several genetic factors which may be involved in the pathogenesis of PD. They could be promising markers for discriminating the PD and potential factors that may affect PD development.",

    "abstract": "Measuring olfactory dysfunction shows promise as one of a number of nonmotor biomarkers that can be used to detect clinically manifest and prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and to differentiate these from nonsynucleinopathies. Using a larger sample size than in our previous study, we evaluated the relationship between olfactory dysfunction based on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) to the clinicopathological findings in patients with PD (n=41), patients with incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD) (n=47), and controls with no neurodegenerative disease (n=137).\nThis study was conducted through the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease (AZSAND). We selected individuals who had an UPSIT score completed antemortem and were clinicopathologically diagnosed with PD, ILBD, or control. Various measures included density of Lewy type synucleinopathy (aSyn) in the olfactory bulb and tract, as well as connected mesial temporal lobe structures. Cases and controls were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with pairwise contrasts.\nCompared to controls (mean: 27.8, standard deviation [SD]: 6.0), the mean UPSIT scores were lower for PD (15.8, SD: 6.0, \nThese findings replicate, with a larger sample size, our previously published findings that individuals with autopsy-confirmed PD and ILBD have significantly lower UPSIT scores compared to controls. These data add to the growing body of evidence supporting early olfactory dysfunction as a prodromal biomarker for the risk of developing PD and ILBD as a prodromal Lewy body disorder.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered an alternative treatment for patients with rapidly developing Parkinson's disease (PD). DBS can cause cognitive changes, and it is necessary to perform an executive assessment before and after DBS to better define the prognosis.\nThe aim of this study was to analyze the use of the Stroop test for assessment of cognitive functions in patients with PD undergoing DBS.\nThe systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Pubmed, Scopus, PsycInfo, and Web of Science were used as electronic databases. All included studies assessed the cognitive ability of patients with PD undergoing DBS through the application of the Stroop test.\nThirty-five articles met the inclusion criteria. Among the studies, there were different formats of Stroop applications. Twenty-three articles presented negative results in relation to the individuals' performances in Stroop, compared to the control groups. The results suggested that there was no correlation between low performance in the test and global cognitive risk for the patients.\nPatients with DBS declined in Stroop performance and showed impairments in response inhibition and speed. These results are not related to the lack of cognitive security of DBS. The Stroop test can be combined with other cognitive instruments to ensure greater approximation of results with reality measures.",

    "abstract": "Blood uric acid level indicates an emerging biomarker in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to evaluate longitudinal uric acid levels among different kinds of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutations and to compare it among sporadic PD, genetic cohort Parkinson's disease (GENPD), genetic cohort unaffected (GENUN), and healthy control (HC) patients.\nWe conducted a study on 654 individuals from the Parkinson's progression markers initiative (PPMI) database. Baseline characteristics, uric acid levels, movement disorder society unified Parkinson's disease rating scale III (MDS-UPDRS III), Hoehn and Yahr Parkinson stage (H&Y stage), and DaT scan specific binding ratio (SBR) data were obtained. Different GBA mutations were collected and categorized into three groups. Longitudinal measurements of uric acid and MDS-UPDRS III score were evaluated during 3-years of follow-up.\nGENPD cohort exhibited a greater MDS-UPDRS III score, H&Y stage, and lower SBR in the right caudate, left caudate, and right putamen compared to sporadic PD. Baseline uric acid level was similar among all groups and different GBA variants. After adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index, the uric acid level was significantly lower in the GENPD group than in HC during year 2 (P-value: 0.009). No significant longitudinal differences were detected for the MDS-UPDRS III score and three groups of GBA mutations.\nThis is the first study to assess uric acid levels and MDS-UPDRS III scores among different GBA mutation variants within 3 years of follow-up. We found similar clinical characteristics among different subtypes of GBA mutations.",

    "abstract": "Gait, balance, and cognitive impairment make travel cumbersome for People with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). About 75% of PwPD cared for at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences' Movement Disorders Clinic reside in medically underserved areas (MUAs). Validated remote evaluations could help improve their access to care. Our goal was to explore the feasibility of telemedicine research visits for the evaluation of multi-modal function in PwPD in a rural state.\nIn-home telemedicine research visits were performed in PwPD. Motor and non-motor disease features were evaluated and quantified by trained personnel, digital survey instruments for self-assessments, digital voice recordings, and scanned and digitized Archimedes spiral drawings. Participant's MUA residence was determined after evaluations were completed.\nTwenty of the fifty PwPD enrolled resided in MUAs. The groups were well matched for disease duration, modified motor UPDRS, and Montreal Cognitive assessment scores but MUA participants were younger. Ninety-two percent were satisfied with their visit, and 61% were more likely to participate in future telemedicine research. MUA participants traveled longer distances, with higher travel costs, lower income, and education level. While 50% of MUA participants reported self-reliance for in-person visits, 85% reported self-reliance for the telemedicine visit. We rated audio-video quality highly in approximately 60% of visits in both groups. There was good correlation with prior in-person research assessments in a subset of participants.\nIn-home research visits for PwPD in MUAs are feasible and could help improve access to care and research participation in these traditionally underrepresented populations.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent brain motor disorder and is frequently regarded as an idiopathic and sporadic disease due to its unclear etiology. Although the pathological mechanisms of PD have already been investigated at various omics levels, no disease-modifying drugs are currently available. At the moment, treatments can only provide symptomatic relief to control or improve motor symptoms. Parkinson's disease is a multifactorial disease, the development and progression of which are influenced by multiple factors, including the genetic markups and the environment. As an indispensable component of our daily life, nutrition is considered one of the most robust environmental factors affecting our health. Consequently, depending on our dietary habits, nutrition can either induce or reduce our susceptibility to PD. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression through DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) activity. Accumulating evidence from nutriepigenomics studies has reported altered epigenetic mechanisms in clinical and pre-clinical PD models, and the potential role of nutrition in modifying the changes. In addition, through nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics studies, the diet-gene, and gene-diet interactions concerning PD development and progression have been investigated. Herein, current findings on the roles of nutrition in epigenetic mechanisms underpinning PD development and progression are discussed. Recent advancements in the multi-omics approach in PD nutrition research are also underlined. The ability of nutrients to influence epigenetic mechanisms and the availability of multi-omics applications compel the immediate use of personalized nutrition as adjuvant therapy for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Although it is clear that dopaminergic neurons degenerate, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown, and thus, successful treatment is still elusive. One pro-apoptotic pathway associated with several neurodegenerative diseases is the tyrosine kinase c-Abl and its target p73. Here, we evaluated the contribution of c-Abl and p73 in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons induced by the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine as a model for Parkinson's disease. First, we found that in SH-SY5Y cells treated with 6-hydroxydopamine, c-Abl and p73 phosphorylation levels were up-regulated. Also, we found that the pro-apoptotic p73 isoform TAp73 was up-regulated. Then, to evaluate whether c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for 6-hydroxydopamine-induced apoptosis, we co-treated SH-SY5Y cells with 6-hydroxydopamine and Imatinib, a c-Abl specific inhibitor, observing that Imatinib prevented p73 phosphorylation, TAp73 up-regulation, and protected SH-SY5Y cells treated with 6-hydroxydopamine from apoptosis. Interestingly, this observation was confirmed in the c-Abl conditional null mice, where 6-hydroxydopamine stereotaxic injections induced a lesser reduction of dopaminergic neurons than in the wild-type mice significantly. Finally, we found that the intraperitoneal administration of Imatinib prevented the death of dopaminergic neurons induced by injecting 6-hydroxydopamine stereotaxically in the mice striatum. Thus, our findings support the idea that the c-Abl/p73 pathway is involved in 6-hydroxydopamine degeneration and suggest that inhibition of its kinase activity might be used as a therapeutical drug in Parkinson's disease.",

Multiple linear regression and linear mixed effects models were used to examine the associations of baseline/longitudinal CSF NfL with cognitive decline and other CSF biomarkers. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used to compare the cumulative probability risk of cognition progression during the follow-up. Multivariate cox regression was used to detect cognitive progression in \nWe found PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) was higher than with normal cognition (PD-NC) in terms of CSF NfL baseline levels (\nOur results indicated that CSF NfL is a promising prognostic predictor of PD, and its concentration and dynamics can monitor the severity and progression of cognitive decline in ",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have revealed alteration of functional connectivity (FC) in Parkinson's disease patients with anxiety (PD-A), but local brain activities associated with anxiety in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients remain to be elucidated. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis was employed to investigate alterations of regional brain activities in PD-A patients.\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were acquired from 42 PD-A patients, 41 PD patients without anxiety (PD-NA), and 40 age-and gender-matched healthy control (HC) subjects. ReHo analysis was used to investigate the synchronization of neuronal activities in brain regions in the three groups. The relationship between ReHo value and anxiety score in the PD-A group was also investigated.\nParkinson's disease patients with anxiety showed increased ReHo values in the bilateral frontal lobes, caudate nucleus, and anterior cingulate gyrus [Gaussian random field (GRF) correction, voxel size \nThe development of PD-A may be associated with dysfunctional local activities in multiple brain regions, including the frontal cortex, cerebella, basal ganglia, and limbic system. Abnormal ReHo values in these brain regions may serve as neuroimaging markers for the early diagnosis of PD-A. The results suggest that using ReHo analysis to identify functional changes in core regions may advance our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PD-A.",

    "abstract": "Impulsive compulsive behaviors (ICBs) often disturb patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD), of which impulse control disorder (ICD) and dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) are two major subsets. The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is involved in ICB; however, it remains unclear how the NAcc affects cortical function and defines the different behavioral characteristics of ICD and DDS.\nTo identify the cortico-striatal network primarily involved in ICB and the differences in these networks between patients with ICD and DDS using structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.\nPatients with PD were recruited using data from a previous cohort study and divided into those with ICB (ICB group) and without ICB (non-ICB group) using the Japanese version of the Questionnaire for Impulsive Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (J-QUIP). From these two groups, we extracted 37 pairs matched for age, sex, disease duration, and levodopa equivalent daily dose of dopamine agonists. Patients with ICB were further classified as having ICD or DDS based on the J-QUIP subscore. General linear models were used to compare gray matter volume and functional connectivity (FC) of the NAcc, caudate, and putamen between the ICB and non-ICB groups and between patients with ICD and those with DDS.\nWe found no significant differences in gray matter volumebetween the ICB and non-ICB groups or between patients with ICD and those with DDS. Compared with the non-ICB group, the FC of the right NAcc in the ICB group was lower in the bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex and higher in the left middle occipital gyrus. Furthermore, patients with DDS showed higher FC between the right putamen and left superior temporal gyrus and higher FC between the left caudate and bilateral middle occipital gyrus than patients with ICD. In contrast, patients with ICD exhibited higher FC between the left NAcc and the right posterior cingulate cortex than patients with DDS.\nThe functionally altered network between the right NAcc and ventromedial prefrontal cortex was associated with ICB in PD. In addition, the surrounding cortico-striatal networks may differentiate the behavioral characteristics of patients with ICD and those with DDS.",

    "abstract": "As one of the imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease, lacunes has received little attention. The objective of this study was to investigate the associations of lacunes, cognition and motor function in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and whether these associations are independent of other imaging markers.\nPatients were consecutively included from April 2019 to July 2022 in \nNinety-four patients were included in this study, 56 without lacunes and 38 with lacunes. Patients with lacunes showed shorter disease duration, slower gait speed and spent more time on Trail-Making Test part A (TMT-A) than those without lacunes. The number of lacunes were positively correlated with the time to complete the TMT-A and negatively related to gait speed. Multivariate linear regression models showed that the presence of lacunes was associated with longer TMT-A time after adjusting for potential confounders.\nLacunes were independently associated with worse visual scanning, attention, and processing speed in patients with PD. In addition, lacunes may accelerate the course of PD. Early treatment of vascular disease provides an alternate way to mitigate some motor and cognitive dysfunction in patients with PD.\nLacunes were independently associated with worse visual scanning, attention, and processing speed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although aging is the primary cause, environmental and genetic factors have also been implicated in its etiology. In fact, the sporadic nature of PD (i.e., unknown etiology) renders the uncovering of the exact pathogenic mechanism(s) or development of effective pharmacotherapies challenging. In search of novel neuroprotectants, we showed that butyrate (BUT), a short-chain fatty acid, protects against salsolinol (SALS)-induced toxicity in human neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cells, which are considered an in-vitro model of PD. Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a flavonoid derived from Asian medicinal plant, has also shown effectiveness against oxidative damage and neuroinflammation, hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we show that pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with DHM concentration-dependently prevented SALS-induced toxicity and that a combination of DHM and BUT resulted in a synergistic protection. The effects of both DHM and BUT in turn could be completely blocked by flumazenil (FLU), a GABA",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence has demonstrated dysfunction of the glymphatic system in \u03b1-synucleinopathy and related diseases. In this study, we aimed to use diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) and MRI-visible enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) to evaluate glymphatic system function quantitatively and qualitatively and its relationship to clinical scores of disease severity in Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET).\nOverall, 124 patients with PD, 74 with ET, and 106 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. Two trained neurologists performed quantitative calculations of ALPS on DTI and visual ratings of EPVS on T2-weighted images in the centrum semiovale (CSO), basal ganglia (BG), midbrain, and cerebellum.\nThe ALPS index was lower in patients with PD than in patients with ET (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and HC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Similarly, patients with PD showed a more severe EPVS burden in the CSO, BG, and midbrain compared to ET and HC. Moreover, the ALPS index was negatively correlated with disease severity in the PD subgroups; however, it did not differ within the ET subgroup. No differences in ALPS or EPVS were observed between the ET and HC groups.\nIn conclusion, DTI-ALPS and EPVS both provide neuroimaging evidence of glymphatic system dysfunction in PD, which further supports that PD is an \u03b1-synucleinopathy disease, while ET is a cerebellar dysfunction-related disease.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often suffer from sleep disturbances, including excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). These symptoms are also experienced by patients with narcolepsy, which is characterized by orexin neuronal loss. In PD, a decrease in orexin neurons is observed pathologically, but the association between sleep disturbance in PD and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin levels is still unclear. This study aimed to clarify the role of orexin as a biomarker in patients with PD. CSF samples were obtained from a previous cohort study conducted between 2015 and 2020. We cross-sectionally and longitudinally examined the association between CSF orexin levels, sleep, and clinical characteristics. We analyzed 78 CSF samples from 58 patients with PD and 21 samples from controls. CSF orexin levels in patients with PD (median = 272.0 [interquartile range = 221.7-334.5] pg/mL) were lower than those in controls (352.2 [296.2-399.5] pg/mL, p = 0.007). There were no significant differences in CSF orexin levels according to EDS, RBD, or the use of dopamine agonists. Moreover, no significant correlation was observed between CSF orexin levels and clinical characteristics by multiple linear regression analysis. Furthermore, the longitudinal changes in orexin levels were also not correlated with clinical characteristics. This study showed decreased CSF orexin levels in patients with PD, but these levels did not show any correlation with any clinical characteristics. Our results suggest the limited efficacy of CSF orexin levels as a biomarker for PD, and that sleep disturbances may also be affected by dysfunction of the nervous system other than orexin, or by dopaminergic treatments in PD. Understanding the reciprocal role of orexin among other neurotransmitters may provide a better treatment strategy for sleep disturbance in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Gait dysfunction is one of the most difficult motor signs to treat in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Understanding its pathophysiology and developing more effective therapies for parkinsonian gait dysfunction will require preclinical studies that can quantitatively and objectively assess the spatial and temporal features of gait.\nWe developed a novel system for measuring volitional, naturalistic gait patterns in non-human primates, and then applied the approach to characterize the progression of parkinsonian gait dysfunction across a sequence of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatments that allowed for intrasubject comparisons across mild, moderate, and severe stages.\nParkinsonian gait dysfunction was characterized across treatment levels by a slower stride speed, increased time in both the stance and swing phase of the stride cycle, and decreased cadence that progressively worsened with overall parkinsonian severity. In contrast, decreased stride length occurred most notably in the moderate to severe parkinsonian state.\nThe results suggest that mild parkinsonism in the primate model of PD starts with temporal gait deficits, whereas spatial gait deficits manifest after reaching a more severe parkinsonian state overall. This study provides important context for preclinical studies in non-human primates studying the neurophysiology of and treatments for parkinsonian gait.",

    "abstract": "Community-based exercise is a continuation and complement to inpatient rehabilitation for Parkinson's disease and does not require a professional physical therapist or equipment. The effects, parameters, and forms of each exercise are diverse, and the effect is affected by many factors. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effect and the best parameters for improving motor symptoms and to explore the possible factors affecting the effect of community-based exercise.\u00a0 METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of six databases: PEDro, PubMed/Medline, CENTRAL, Scopus, Embase, and WOS. Studies that compared community-based exercise with usual care were included. The intervention mainly included dance, Chinese martial arts, Nordic walking, and home-based exercise. The primary outcome measure was the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) score. The mean difference (95% CI) was used to calculate the treatment outcomes of continuous outcome variables, and the I\nThis meta-analysis suggests that community-based exercise may benefit motor function in patients with PD. The most commonly used modalities of exercise were tango and tai chi, and the most common prescription was 60\u00a0min twice a week. Future studies should consider the influence of age, duration of treatment, and weekly frequency on the effect of exercise.\nCRD42022327162.",

    "abstract": "Issues around turning can impair daily tasks and trigger episodes of freezing of gait in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Slow speeds\u00a0associated with aging produce a more en-bloc movement strategy which have been linked with falls while turning. However, the influence of speed of turning on the complex whole-body coordination considering eye movements, turning kinematics, and stepping characteristics during turning has not been examined. The aim of this study was to investigate if individuals with PD have a different response to changes in turning speed compared to healthy older adults during 180\u00b0 standing turns. 20 individuals with PD and 20 healthy age matched adults participated in this study. Data were collected during clockwise and counter-clockwise turns at\u00a0three self-selected speeds in a randomised order: (a) normal; (b) faster than normal; and (c) slower than normal.\u00a0Eye movement and turning kinematics were investigated using electrooculography and Inertial Measurement Units. Mixed Model Analysis of Variance (MM ANOVA) tests with post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed to assess the differences between groups and turning speed. In addition, further post hoc Repeated Measures ANOVA (RM ANOVA) tests were performed if any significant interactions were seen between groups and turning speed. Significant interaction effects were found in eye movement and turning kinematics, and the RM ANOVA showed significant main effects for turning speeds within the PD and the control groups. Turning slowly resulted in similar alterations in eye movement, turning kinematics and stepping characteristics in the PD group and the healthy controls. However, individuals with PD showed a different response to the healthy controls, with a greater delay in eye movement and onset latency of segments in turning kinematics and step variables between the different speeds. These findings help our understanding regarding the turning strategies in individuals with PD. The incorporation of guidance with regard to faster turning speeds may be useful in the management of individuals with PD. Clinical training using different turn directions and speeds may improve coordination, increase confidence and reduce the risk of falling.",

    "abstract": "Early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) is very important in clinical diagnosis for preventing disease development. In this study, we present efficient discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based methods for detecting PD from health control (HC) in two cases, namely, off-and on-medication. First, the EEG signals are preprocessed to remove major artifacts before being decomposed into several EEG sub-bands (approximate and details) using DWT. The features are then extracted from the wavelet packet-derived reconstructed signals using different entropy measures, namely, log energy entropy, Shannon entropy, threshold entropy, sure entropy, and norm entropy. Several machine learning techniques are investigated to classify the resulting PD/HC features. The effects of DWT coefficients and brain regions on classification accuracy are being investigated as well. Two public datasets are used to verify the proposed methods: the SanDiego dataset (31 subjects, 93\u00a0min) and the UNM dataset (54 subjects, 54\u00a0min). The results are promising and show that four entropy measures: log energy entropy, threshold entropy, sure entropy, and modified-Shannon entropy (TShEn) lead to high classification accuracy, indicating they are good biomarkers for PD detection. With the SanDiego dataset, the classification results of off-medication PD versus HC are 99.89, 99.87, and 99.91 for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively, using the combination of DWT\u2009+\u2009TShEn and KNN classifier. Using the same combination, the results of on-medication PD versus HC are 94.21, 93.33, and 95%. With the UNM dataset, the obtained classification accuracy is around 99.5% in both cases of off-and on-medication PD using DWT\u2009+\u2009TShEn\u2009+\u2009SVM and DWT\u2009+\u2009ThEn\u2009+\u2009KNN, respectively. The results also demonstrate the importance of all DWT coefficients and that selecting a suitable small number of EEG channels from several brain regions could improve the classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) greatly impacts the daily life of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, predictors of FOG in early PD are limited. Moreover, recent neuroimaging evidence of cerebral morphological alterations in PD is heterogeneous. We aimed to develop a model that could predict the occurrence of FOG using machine learning, collaborating with clinical, laboratory, and cerebral structural imaging information of early drug-na\u00efve PD and investigate alterations in cerebral morphology in early PD. Data from 73 healthy controls (HCs) and 158 early drug-na\u00efve PD patients at baseline were obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort. The CIVET pipeline was used to generate structural morphological features with T1-weighted imaging (T1WI). Five machine learning algorithms were calculated to assess the predictive performance of future FOG in early PD during a 5-year follow-up period. We found that models trained with structural morphological features showed fair to good performance (accuracy range, 0.67-0.73). Performance improved when clinical and laboratory data was added (accuracy range, 0.71-0.78). For machine learning algorithms, elastic net-support vector machine models (accuracy range, 0.69-0.78) performed the best. The main features used to predict FOG based on elastic net-support vector machine models were the structural morphological features that were mainly distributed in the left cerebrum. Moreover, the bilateral olfactory cortex (OLF) showed a significantly higher surface area in PD patients than in HCs. Overall, we found that T1WI morphometric markers helped predict future FOG occurrence in patients with early drug-na\u00efve PD at the individual level. The OLF exhibits predominantly cortical expansion in early PD.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in characterizing the earliest phases of Parkinson disease (PD). However, few studies have investigated prediagnostic trajectories of cognition and function. Our objective was to describe prediagnostic cognitive and functional trajectories in PD in older women and men.\nWe studied 9,595 women and 5,795 men from 2 prospective cohort studies of community-dwelling elders followed up to 20 years. In individuals without prevalent PD, we estimated the associations of incident PD diagnosis with rates of change in cognition and function before and after diagnosis compared with healthy older adults using multivariate mixed-effects models.\nOver follow-up, 297 individuals developed incident PD. Interactions between the terms in our model and sex were statistically significant for the 3 outcomes (\nIndividuals with incident PD exhibit cognitive and functional decline during the prediagnostic phase that exceeds rates associated with normal aging. Better understanding heterogeneity in prodromal PD is essential to enable earlier diagnosis and identify impactful nonmotor symptoms in all subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects dopaminergic neurons in the mesencephalic substantia nigra, causing a progressive clinical course characterized by pre-motor, non-motor and motor symptoms, which negatively impact the quality of life of patients and cause high health care costs. Therefore, the present study aims to discuss the clinical manifestations of PD and to make a correlation with the gut-brain (GB) axis, approaching epidemiology and therapeutic perspectives, to better understand its clinical progression and identify symptoms early. A literature review was performed regarding the association between clinical progression, the gut-brain axis, epidemiology, and therapeutic perspectives, in addition to detailing pre-motor, non-motor symptoms (neuropsychiatric, cognitive, autonomic, sleep disorders, sensory abnormalities) and cardinal motor symptoms. Therefore, this article addresses a topic of extreme relevance, since the previously mentioned clinical manifestations (pre-motor and non-motor) can often act as prodromal markers for the early diagnosis of PD and may precede it by up to 20 years.",

    "abstract": "In the Philippines, the exact prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) has not yet been determined. Although cases can be extrapolated from medical registries, this method may undermine actual case rates. A reliable screening tool for PD is essential for a timely diagnosis and community-based epidemiological studies. The most widely used screening questionnaire for PD diagnosis was developed by Tanner et al.\nTo determine the validity of the Cebuano version of a PD screening questionnaire.\nThe questionnaire was translated from English to Cebuano by a hired language specialist. Each item was supplied with a \nThe overall Cronbach alpha for internal consistency of the questionnaire was 0.9410.

Embora os casos possam ser extrapolados dos registros m\u00e9dicos, esse m\u00e9todo pode prejudicar as taxas reais de casos. Uma ferramenta de triagem confi\u00e1vel para DP \u00e9 essencial para um diagn\u00f3stico oportuno e estudos epidemiol\u00f3gicos baseados na comunidade. O question\u00e1rio de triagem mais utilizado para o diagn\u00f3stico da DP foi desenvolvido por Tanner et al., que consiste em nove quest\u00f5es sobre os sintomas motores da DP. Embora este question\u00e1rio tenha sido traduzido para v\u00e1rios idiomas, a vers\u00e3o traduzida deve ser validada para uso em nosso meio.\n\u2003Determinar a validade da vers\u00e3o Cebuano de um question\u00e1rio de triagem de DP. M\u00e9TODOS: \u2003O question\u00e1rio foi traduzido do ingl\u00eas para o cebuano por um especialista em idiomas contratado. Cada item foi fornecido com uma resposta \u201csim\u201d, \u201cn\u00e3o\u201d ou \u201cn\u00e3o sei\u201d. Um total de 73 pacientes com DP e 244 controles completaram o estudo.\n\u2003Em geral o alfa de Cronbach para consist\u00eancia interna do question\u00e1rio foi de 0,9410. O item \u201ctremor\u201d teve a maior sensibilidade (97,26%), enquanto o item \u201cproblemas com abotoamento\u201d teve a maior especificidade (100,00%).

    "abstract": "We examined the association of sagittal spinal alignment in the standing position with the masses and amounts of intramuscular non-contractile tissue of multiple trunk and lower extremity muscles, such as the hip joint muscles, measured using an ultrasound imaging device in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe participants were 10 patients with PD. Sagittal spinal alignment (thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, and sacral anterior inclination angles) in the standing position was measured using a Spinal Mouse. Muscle thicknesses and echo intensities of the trunk and lower extremity muscles, including the hip joint muscles, were also measured in the prone or supine position using an ultrasound imaging device.\nPartial correlation analysis with body height and weight as control variables showed that a low lumbar lordosis angle in the standing position was significantly associated with low thicknesses of the trunk extensor muscles (lumbar erector spinae and multifidus). Partial correlation analysis also revealed that a high sacral anterior inclination angle in the standing position was significantly associated with low lumbar multifidus muscle thickness. However, the thicknesses and echo intensities of the trunk flexor and hip joint muscles were not significantly related to thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, or sacral anterior inclination angles.\nThe results of this study suggested the association between a low lumbar lordosis angle in the standing position and low lumbar erector spinae and multifidus muscle thicknesses and between a high sacral anterior inclination angle in the standing position and low lumbar multifidus muscle thickness in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Brain atrophy in Parkinson's disease occurs to varying degrees in different brain regions, even at the early stage of the disease. While cortical morphological features are often considered independently in structural brain imaging studies, research on the co-progression of different cortical morphological measurements could provide new insights regarding the progression of PD. This study's aim was to examine the interplay between cortical curvature and thickness as a function of PD diagnosis, motor symptoms, and cognitive performance.\nA total of 359 de novo PD patients and 159 healthy controls (HC) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database were included in this study. Additionally, an independent cohort from four databases (182 PD, 132 HC) with longer disease durations was included to assess the effects of PD diagnosis in more advanced cases. Pearson correlation was used to determine subject-specific associations between cortical curvature and thickness estimated from T1-weighted MRI images. General linear modeling (GLM) was then used to assess the effect of PD diagnosis, motor symptoms, and cognitive performance on the curvature-thickness association. Next, longitudinal changes in the curvature-thickness correlation as well as the predictive effect of the cortical curvature-thickness association on changes in motor symptoms and cognitive performance across four years were investigated. Finally, Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to build a GLM to model PD motor symptom severity cross-sectionally.\nA significant interaction effect between PD motor symptoms and age on the curvature-thickness correlation was found (\u03b2\nThe association between cortical curvature and thickness is related to PD motor symptoms and age. This research shows the potential of modeling the curvature-thickness interplay in PD.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow-derived neural stem cells (BM-NSCs) have shed light on novel therapeutic approaches for PD with the potential to halt or even reverse disease progression. Various strategies have been developed to promote therapeutic efficacy via optimizing implanted cells and the microenvironment of transplantation in the central nervous system (CNS). This current study further proved that the combination of fasudil, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, and BM-NSCs exhibited a synergetic effect on restoring neuron loss in the MPTP-PD mice model. It simultaneously unveiled cellular mechanisms underlying synergistic neuron-protection effects of fasudil and BM-NSCs, which included promoting the proliferation, and migration of endogenous NSCs, and contributing to microglia shift into the M2 phenotype. Corresponding molecular mechanisms were observed, including the inhibition of inflammatory responses, the elevation of neurotrophic factors, and the induction of WNT/\u03b2-catenin and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. Our study provides evidence for the co-intervention of BM-NSCs and fasudil as a promising therapeutic method with enhanced efficacy in treating neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Silent information regulator (SIRT) has distinctive enzymatic activities and physiological functions to control cell-cycle progression, gene expression, and DNA stability by targeting histone and non-histone proteins. SIRT1 enhances synaptic formation and synaptic activity, and therefore, can reduce the progression of various degenerative brain diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). SIRT1 activity is decreased by aging with a subsequent increased risk for the development of degenerative brain diseases. Inhibition of SIRT1 promotes inflammatory reactions since SIRT1 inhibits transcription of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) which also inhibits SIRT1 activation via activation of microRNA and miR-34a which reduce NAD synthesis. SIRT1 is highly expressed in microglia as well as neurons, and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, this review aimed to find the possible role of SIRT1 in PD neuropathology. SIRT1 has neuroprotective effects; therefore, downregulation of SIRT1 during aging promotes p53 expression and may increase the vulnerability of neuronal cell deaths. PD neuropathology is linked with the sequence of inflammatory changes and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines due to the activation of inflammatory signaling pathways. In addition, oxidative stress, inflammatory disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis contribute mutually to PD neuropathology. Thus, SIRT1 and SIRT1 activators play a crucial role in the mitigation of PD neuropathology through the amelioration of oxidative stress, inflammatory disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and inflammatory signaling pathways.",

The pathophysiological changes in PD are inextricably linked to the subcortical structures.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a rapidly increasing incidence and prevalence. Although it affects more than 6 million people worldwide, it is predicted to be doubled by 2040. Current criteria used in the diagnosis of PD include the presence of bradykinesia as well as the presence of rest tremor and/or rigidity, but the clinic is multifaceted and includes many non-motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms may occur in the prodromal period, years before clinically evident Parkinson's disease. During this period, diagnosing the disease will likely be even more important when disease-modifying treatments are available. Currently, there is no single biomarker that can be used in the diagnosis of PD and no disease-modifying treatment is available. Identification of biomarkers in early diagnosis will enable the most effective use of disease-modifying therapies and will shed light on possible underlying pathologies, studies in this area have gained momentum in recent years. Molecular imaging methods, genetic studies, salivary gland and skin biopsies, metabolomics, lysosomal pathway are some of them. In this article, besides the current diagnosis and treatment methods of the disease, biomarkers and treatments that are expected to be better understood in the near future will be mentioned.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is common in the course of Parkinson's disease (PD) and displays a continuum from subjective cognitive impairment to dementia. Illuminating the pathophysiological processes associated with the continuum may help create follow-up and new treatment approaches. In this context, large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks are widely investigated to elucidate the neural processes underlying PD and are promising as non-invasive biomarkers. This systematic review aims to examine the alterations in large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks in the continuum of PD-associated cognitive impairment.\nScienceDirect, Web of Science, and PubMed databases were searched with the specified keywords. The studies obtained as a result of this review were investigated by the PRISMA criteria, which were taken as a basis for the systematic review and writing of meta-analyses.\nA total of 974 studies were obtained from three databases. Twenty studies were included in the systematic review based on predetermined eligibility criteria. Among the large-scale connectivity networks examined in these studies, it was found that sensory-motor networks decreased their connectivity in the continuum of PD-associated cognitive impairment, and there were conflicting results in terms of cognitive networks.\nWell-designed longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the alterations in the intrinsic connectivity networks in the PD cognitive impairment continuum. In these studies, it is necessary to define the cognitive disorder groups well, to control the connectivity changes that may occur due to dopaminergic treatment, and to evaluate Parkinson's patients with subjective cognitive impairment and dementia within the continuum.",

    "abstract": "The relative contributions of factors such as muscle strength, falls risk and low bone mineral density (BMD) to increased fracture risk in Parkinson's Disease (PD) were examined in an analysis of 5212 community-dwelling women age 75\u00a0years or more recruited to a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the oral bisphosphonate, clodronate. Similar number of PD and non-PD subjects received treatment. Each participant had measurements of hip and forearm BMD, muscle strength (hand grip strength and maximum isometric quadriceps strength), ability in the sit-to-stand test, and postural stability. Incident radiographic and/or surgically verified fractures, and deaths, were recorded over an average follow-up of 3.8\u00a0years. A diagnosis of PD was made if it was self-reported and appropriate medication was recorded at the study entry. 47 of the women (0.9\u00a0%) had a diagnosis of PD at baseline. They were of similar age to those without PD, but reported higher disability scores and lower quality of life. While BMD at the forearm and hip regions was lower in PD, this only reached statistical significance at the femoral neck (0.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12 vs 0.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12\u00a0g/cm",

    "abstract": "To explore the effects of dual task (DT) training on DT gait performance and cognitive function in individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) and to examine factors that might influence the effects of DT training.\nPubMed, Wiley Online Library, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Medline were searched for articles published from January 2006 to December 2021.\nRandomized controlled trials comparing DT training with usual care or general exercise were included.\nThe outcomes studied were DT gait parameters including speed, step and stride length, cadence, step and stride time variability, dual-task cost on gait speed, and Trail Making Tests presented as standardized mean differences (SMDs). The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was used to evaluate the quality of evidence.\nTen randomized controlled trials with 466 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The included studies presented, in general, with a low to high risk of bias. Meta-analyses used a random-effects model for all analyses. The meta-analysis showed the DT training effects on DT gait speed (SMD=0.825, P=.012), DT step and stride length (SMD=0.400, P=.015), Trail Making Tests-part A (TMT-A; SMD=0.533, P=.010), and Trail Making Tests-part B (SMD=0.516, P=.012) compared with the control group. Only the effect on TMT-A was maintained at the follow-up assessment. The results of meta-regression showed that participants with slower initial single task gait speed improved more after DT training on DT step and stride length.\nThe DT training improved more in DT gait speed with moderate-quality evidence as compared with usual care or conventional physical training in individuals with PD. The beneficial effects of DT training on DT step and stride length, attention, and executive function were also demonstrated in this meta-analysis. Furthermore, the improvement in the DT walking step and stride length was related to the participant's initial single task gait speed.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical approach with electrical stimulation of certain parts of the brain, which reduce Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms. Since the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is the main pathophysiology of PD, we aimed to evaluate the association of response to DBS with preoperative dopamine transporter density (DAT) and its postoperative changes in PD patients who underwent the bilateral implantation of the electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN).\nA prospective evaluation of Parkinson's disease patients who underwent STN-DBS for 2\u2009years was done. 99mTc-TRODAT-1 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan and assessment of PD using unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) III were performed in both pre- and post-operation states. The correlation of response to DBS after 6\u2009months was assessed with baseline findings and postoperative changes of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 SPECT parameters.\nCompared to the preoperative state, UPDRS III scores and Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) were significantly decreased after DBS. However, in 17 patients who underwent both pre-and post-operative 99mTc-TRODAT-1 SPECT, no significant change was seen in any quantitative parameters, including right and left striatal-binding ratio (SBR) as well as striatal asymmetry index (SAI). No significant correlation was also found between the percent of UPDRS III change after DBS and values of preoperative SBRs. The percentage of LEDD reduction also showed no significant correlation with the preoperative state of 99\u2009m-TRODAT-1 SPECT.\nOur results showed that the mechanism of DBS action is not accompanied by short-term compensation of DAT in basal ganglia in severely advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "Health and social care systems face difficulties in managing multimorbidity, disease burden and complex needs in long-term conditions such as Parkinson's disease.\nThis study aimed to develop a European understanding of how health and social care professionals can collaborate with stakeholders from different organizations and sectors to enhance the management of Parkinson's disease in a community setting by identifying the existing gaps in this process and how people with Parkinson's disease and their family carers could benefit from these partnerships.\nA mixed-methods sequential study was conducted in Denmark, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom. The findings from the qualitative phase are presented. Individual semistructured interviews were analysed using Braun's and Clarke's thematic analysis. A meta-ethnography approach was used to analyse and synthesize cross-national findings.\nA total of 41 healthcare professionals and 39 stakeholders from different disciplines and sectors were interviewed in the four countries. The participants acknowledged a lack of awareness of available resources and poor communication between the different support systems in the management of Parkinson's disease. To promote multiagency collaborations, the participants highlighted the need to organize services along the Parkinson's disease journey, patient involvement and strategic involvement of carers in organizing resources and Parkinson's disease care pathways. According to the participants, the benefits from multiagency partnerships could lead to an enhanced continuity of care and specialized knowledge, mobilization of resources in the community, personalized support and improved access to services.\nPolicymakers are called upon to create formal structures that facilitate multisectoral collaborations to promote an integrated system of care for the management of Parkinson's disease in the community. To address this challenge, we propose five strategies showing how organizations can work together to optimize the use of resources and enhance the management of Parkinson's disease throughout the illness trajectory.\nPatient and Public Involvement groups made up of stakeholders, healthcare professionals, patients with Parkinson's disease and family carers participated in the design of the study, the development of the interview guides and the validation of the findings.",

    "results": "A total of 41 healthcare professionals and 39 stakeholders from different disciplines and sectors were interviewed in the four countries. The participants acknowledged a lack of awareness of available resources and poor communication between the different support systems in the management of Parkinson's disease. To promote multiagency collaborations, the participants highlighted the need to organize services along the Parkinson's disease journey, patient involvement and strategic involvement of carers in organizing resources and Parkinson's disease care pathways. According to the participants, the benefits from multiagency partnerships could lead to an enhanced continuity of care and specialized knowledge, mobilization of resources in the community, personalized support and improved access to services.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is often most recognized for motor symptoms but associated non-motor symptoms such as sexual dysfunction can significantly impact quality of life. This condition involves a hormonal disruption and has a predilection for male patients, yet there are no formal guidelines for screening or management of sexual health pathology in these patients. While prior publications have addressed the presence of sexual dysfunction (SD) among men with PD, there has been a paucity of work examining the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and the interplay between dopamine, prolactin (PRL), and testosterone. This review provides an overview of data extracted from the existing peer-reviewed literature regarding hormonal and sexual health changes in men with PD and the impact of dopaminergic and/or androgen replacement therapy. Furthermore, while some research suggests that PD patients are at higher risk for prolactin elevation and testosterone deficiency, heterogeneity of the data limits extrapolation. Additionally, data related to pharmacologic optimization of the HPG axis in this patient population is similarly limited. Prospective studies are needed to better characterize the hormonal pathophysiology of PD as it relates to sexual dysfunction such that men at risk can be effectively identified so as to offer interventions that may improve quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are specialized organelles with an acidic pH that act as recycling hubs for intracellular and extracellular components. They harbour numerous different hydrolytic enzymes to degrade substrates like proteins, peptides, and glycolipids. Reduced catalytic activity of lysosomal enzymes can cause the accumulation of these substrates and loss of lysosomal integrity, resulting in lysosomal dysfunction and lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). Post-mitotic cells, such as neurons, seem to be highly sensitive to damages induced by lysosomal dysfunction, thus LSDs often manifest with neurological symptoms. Interestingly, some LSDs and Parkinson's disease (PD) share common cellular pathomechanisms, suggesting convergence of aetiology of the two disease types. This is further underlined by genetic associations of several lysosomal genes involved in LSDs with PD. The increasing number of lysosome-associated genetic risk factors for PD makes it necessary to understand functions and interactions of lysosomal proteins/enzymes both in health and disease, thereby holding the potential to identify new therapeutic targets. In this review, we highlight genetic and mechanistic interactions between the complex lysosomal network, LSDs and PD, and elaborate on methodical challenges in lysosomal research.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal tract. The identification of disease-modifying therapies is the Holy Grail of PD research, but to date no drug has been approved as such a therapy. A possible reason is the remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity of PD patients, which can generate confusion in the interpretation of results or even mask the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention. This heterogeneity should be taken into account in clinical trials, stratifying patients by their expected response to drugs designed to engage selected molecular targets. In this setting, stratification methods (clinical and genetic) should be supported by biochemical phenotyping of PD patients, in line with the deep phenotyping concept. Collection, from single patients, of a range of biological samples would streamline the generation of these profiles. Several studies have proposed biochemical characterisations of patient cohorts based on analysis of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, stool, saliva and skin biopsy samples, with extracellular vesicles attracting increasing interest as a source of biomarkers. In this review we report and critically discuss major studies that used a biochemical approach to stratify their PD cohorts. The analyte most studied is \u03b1-synuclein, while other studies have focused on neurofilament light chain, lysosomal proteins, inflammasome-related proteins, LRRK2 and the urinary proteome. At present, stratification of PD patients, while promising, is still a nascent approach. Deep phenotyping of patients will allow clinical researchers to identify homogeneous subgroups for the investigation of tailored disease-modifying therapies, enhancing the chances of therapeutic success.",

This study updates excess death statistics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) up to 2022 and evaluates their demographic and spatial disparities in the USA.\nThis is an ecological time-series analysis of AD and PD mortality in the USA from January 2018 to March 2022. Poisson log-linear regressions were utilised to fit the weekly death data. Excess deaths were calculated with the difference between the observed and expected deaths under a counterfactual scenario of pandemic absence.\nFrom March 2020 to March 2022, we observed 41,115 and 10,328 excess deaths for AD and PD, respectively. The largest percentage increases in excess AD and PD deaths were found in the initial pandemic wave. For people aged \u226585\u00a0years, excess mortalities of AD and PD (per million persons) were 3946.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2954.3, 4892.3) and 624.3 (95% CI: 369.4, 862.5), which were about 23 and 9 times higher than those aged 55-84\u00a0years, respectively. Females had a three-time higher excess mortality of AD than males (182.6 vs. 67.7 per million persons). The non-Hispanic Black people experienced larger increases in AD or PD deaths (excess percentage: 31.8% for AD and 34.6% for PD) than the non-Hispanic White population (17.1% for AD and 14.7% for PD).\nUnder the continuing threats of COVID-19, efforts should be made to optimise health care capacity for patients with AD and PD.",

Common variants were subjected to single-variant tests by PLINK, then gene-based analyses were used for rare variants with the optimized sequence kernel association test (SKAT-O). For genotype-phenotype correlation assessment, regression models were conducted to compare clinical features between the studied groups.\nThree common variants (rs1044006, rs1043997, and rs1043994) showed a nominal protective effect against PD.

Both are associated with neuroinflammation, with a proposed microbial component for disease initiation and/or progression. Notably, A\u03b2 and \u03b1-synuclein have been shown to possess antimicrobial properties. There is evidence for bacterial presence within the brain, including the oral pathobiont \nHere, we use high resolution 16S rRNA PCR-based Next Generation Sequencing (16SNGS) to characterize bacterial composition in brain areas associated with the early, intermediate and late-stage of the diseases.\nThis study reveals the widespread presence of bacteria in areas of the brain associated with AD and PD pathology, with distinctly different bacterial profiles in blood and brain. Brain area profiles were overall somewhat similar, predominantly oral, with some bacteria subgingival and oronasal in origin, and relatively comparable profiles in AD and PD brain. However, brain areas associated with early disease development, such as the locus coeruleus, were substantially different in bacterial DNA content compared to areas affected later in disease etiology.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is neurodegenerative disease with a multifactorial etiopathogenesis with accumulating evidence identifying microbiota as a potential factor in the earliest, prodromal phases of the disease. Previous research has already shown a significant difference between gut microbiota composition in PD patients as opposed to healthy controls, with a growing number of studies correlating gut microbiota changes with the clinical presentation of the disease in later stages, through various motor and non-motor symptoms. Our aim in this systematic review is to compose and assess current knowledge in the field and determine if the findings could influence future clinical practice as well as therapy in PD.\nWe have conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines through MEDLINE and Embase databases, with studies being selected for inclusion via a set inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n20 studies were included in this systematic review according to the selected inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search yielded 18 case control studies, 1 case study, and 1 prospective case study with no controls. The total number of PD patients encompassed in the studies cited in this review is 1,511.\nThe link between gut microbiota and neurodegeneration is a complex one and it depends on various factors. The relative abundance of various microbiota taxa in the gut has been consistently shown to have a correlation with motor and non-motor symptom severity. The answer could lie in the products of gut microbiota metabolism which have also been linked to PD. Further research is thus warranted in the field, with a focus on the metabolic function of gut microbiota in relation to motor and non-motor symptoms.",

    "conclusions": "The link between gut microbiota and neurodegeneration is a complex one and it depends on various factors. The relative abundance of various microbiota taxa in the gut has been consistently shown to have a correlation with motor and non-motor symptom severity. The answer could lie in the products of gut microbiota metabolism which have also been linked to PD. Further research is thus warranted in the field, with a focus on the metabolic function of gut microbiota in relation to motor and non-motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Apart from common respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms are prevalent among patients with COVID-19. Research has shown that infection with SARS-CoV-2 accelerated alpha-synuclein aggregation, induced Lewy-body-like pathology, caused dopaminergic neuron senescence, and worsened symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce neuroinflammation and facilitate subsequent neurodegeneration in long COVID, and increase individual vulnerability to PD or parkinsonism. These findings suggest that a post-COVID-19 parkinsonism might follow the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to prevent a possible post-COVID-19 parkinsonism, this paper reviewed neurological symptoms and related findings of COVID-19 and related infectious diseases (influenza and prion disease) and neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, PD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), and discussed potential mechanisms underlying the neurological symptoms and the relationship between the infectious diseases and the neurodegenerative disorders, as well as the therapeutic and preventive implications in the neurodegenerative disorders. Infections with a relay of microbes (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A viruses, gut bacteria, etc.) and prion-like alpha-synuclein proteins over time may synergize to induce PD. Therefore, a systematic approach that targets these pathogens and the pathogen-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration may provide cures for neurodegenerative disorders. Further, antiviral/antimicrobial drugs, vaccines, immunotherapies and new therapies (e.g., stem cell therapy) need to work together to treat, manage or prevent these disorders. As medical science and technology advances, it is anticipated that better vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 variants, new antiviral/antimicrobial drugs, effective immunotherapies (alpha-synuclein antibodies, vaccines for PD or parkinsonism, etc.), as well as new therapies will be developed and made available in the near future, which will help prevent a possible post-COVID-19 parkinsonism in the 21st century.",

    "abstract": "To assess the impact of chewing movement in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), we examined the relation between chewing movement and motor dysfunction in association with PD progression.\nThirty patients with PD (mean age, 68.9 \u00b1 9.0 years; mean Hoehn and Yahr stage, 3.0 \u00b1 0.7) were recruited. The PD condition was assessed in each patient by using the score of Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III score, body mass index (BMI), serum albumin (Alb), and tongue pressure, number of chews, mealtime, and chewing speed were collected. The patients were divided into two groups (mild and moderate PD groups) based on an MDS-UPDRS part III cut-off value of 32.\nThe chewing speed positively correlated with tongue pressure (\nThese results indicated that the progression of motor dysfunction in patients with PD is likely to affect chewing speed and the nutritional status decline may be linked to the impairment of chewing movement in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in Parkinson's disease (PD-RBD) tend to have poor cognitive performance and faster cognitive deterioration, and the potential mechanism is still ambiguous. Therefore, this study aimed to detect the alterations in local brain function in PD-RBD.\nFifty patients, including 23 patients with PD-RBD and 27 patients with PD without RBD (PD-nRBD), and 26 healthy controls were enrolled. All subjects were subjected to one-night polysomnography and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The fMRI images of the three groups were analyzed by regional homogeneity (ReHo) to observe the local neural activity. Correlations between altered ReHo values and chin electromyographic (EMG) density scores and cognitive scores in the PD subgroups were assessed.\nCompared with the patients with PD-nRBD, the patients with PD-RBD had higher ReHo values in the frontal cortex (the right superior frontal gyrus, the right middle frontal gyrus and the left medial superior frontal gyrus), the right caudate nucleus and the right anterior cingulate gyrus, and compared with the HCs, the patients with PD-RBD had lower ReHo values in the bilateral cuneus, the bilateral precuneus, the left inferior temporal gyrus and the left inferior occipital gyrus. For the patients with PD-RBD, the phasic chin EMG density scores were positively correlated with the ReHo values in the left medial superior frontal gyrus, and the tonic chin EMG density scores were positively correlated with the ReHo values in the right anterior cingulate gyrus.\nThis study indicates that increased ReHo in the frontal cortex, the caudate nucleus and the anterior cingulate gyrus may be linked with the abnormal motor behaviors during REM sleep and that decreased ReHo in the posterior regions may be related to the visuospatial-executive function in patients with PD-RBD.",

There is currently no cure for PD, although there are several treatment options for relieving PD symptoms. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation therapy that shows promising results for the treatment of PD.\nHere, we present a patient with PD. We investigated whether an accelerate form of high-frequency (HF) rTMS on the contralateral side to the patient's main difficulties is clinically effective in treating health-related quality of life (QoL) symptomatology and depressive symptoms in PD as well as the long-term effects of rTMS in PD during the maintenance phase.\nResults showed that HF-rTMS administered over the right primary motor cortex (M1) is a safe and well-tolerated treatment that improved the patient's health related QoL and depressive symptoms. These positive effects lasted at least five months post treatment.\nTherefore, HF-rTMS over the right M1 can be a possible treatment option for patients with PD, although further investigations are necessary to validate the findings of the present case report.",

    "abstract": "The minimum data set (MDS) is one of the important steps in the development of health care information systems. According to the Ministry of Health in Iran, a central and national registry along with Parkinson's MDS (PMDS) has not yet existed. So, this research was conducted to establish a PMDS in Iran.\nThis study was a descriptive-comparative method, which was done in 2019-2021 in four phases: (1) determining data elements related to Parkinson's disease in Iran and selected countries; (2) extracting and categorizing the data elements; (3) making a PMDS draft; (4) evaluating a draft by Delphi technique. The research population was the MDS in Australia, Canada, the United States of America, and Iran. After extracting the data elements of Parkinson's disease from various resources, the primary draft PMDS was developed. Then, the research group divided it into two categories (administrative and clinical). After that, it was sent to 50 healthcare professionals for validation by the Delphi method.\nFollowing the results of the two rounds of Delphi technique, Finally, PMDS was established including a total of 223 data elements in two categories: administrative and clinical with 72 and 151, respectively. Every category included 10 and 14 subcategories.\nThe first and the most important step for standardization of data collection nationally is creating MDS. Due to the necessity of the existence of PMDS, a complete list of PMDS was established for collecting data on Parkinson's patients.",

Autoimmune cells exist in the brain parenchyma, cerebrospinal fluid, and meninges; they are considered inducers of neuroinflammation and regulate the immune in the human brain in PD.

    "abstract": "Highly reproducible epidemiological evidence shows that type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases the risk and rate of progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), and crucially, the repurposing of certain antidiabetic medications for the treatment of PD has shown early promise in clinical trials, suggesting that the effects of T2D on PD pathogenesis may be modifiable. The high prevalence of T2D means that a significant proportion of patients with PD may benefit from personalized antidiabetic treatment approaches that also confer neuroprotective benefits. Therefore, there is an immediate need to better understand the mechanistic relation between these conditions and the specific molecular pathways affected by T2D in the brain. Although there is considerable evidence that processes such as insulin signaling, mitochondrial function, autophagy, and inflammation are involved in the pathogenesis of both PD and T2D, the primary aim of this review is to highlight the evidence showing that T2D-associated dysregulation of these pathways occurs not only in the periphery but also in the brain and how this may facilitate neurodegeneration in PD. We also discuss the challenges involved in disentangling the complex relationship between T2D, insulin resistance, and PD, as well as important questions for further research. \u00a9 2022 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder which is characterised mostly by loss of dopaminergic nerve cells throughout the nigral area mainly as a consequence of oxidative stress. Muscle stiffness, disorganised bodily responses, disturbed sleep, weariness, amnesia, and voice impairment are all symptoms of dopaminergic neuron degeneration and existing symptomatic treatments are important to arrest additional neuronal death. Some cannabinoids have recently been demonstrated as robust antioxidants that might protect the nerve cells from degeneration even when cannabinoid receptors are not triggered. Cannabinoids are likely to have property to slow or presumably cease the steady deterioration of the brain's dopaminergic systems, a condition for which there is now no treatment. The use of cannabinoids in combination with currently available drugs has the potential to introduce a radically new paradigm for treatment of Parkinson's disease, making it immensely useful in the treatment of such a debilitating illness.",

    "abstract": "The deep brain stimulation (DBS) in early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) pilot clinical trial randomized 30 patients (Hoehn & Yahr II off; medication duration 0.5-4 years; without dyskinesia/motor fluctuations) to optimal drug therapy (ODT) (early ODT) or bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS plus ODT (early DBS+ODT). This study aims to report the 11-year outcomes of patients who completed the DBS in early-stage PD pilot clinical trial.\nAttempts were made to contact all 29 subjects who completed the two-year trial to participate in an 11-year follow-up study. Mixed-effects models compared overall trend in outcomes for randomization groups (fixed-effects: assigned treatment, year, their interaction; random-effect: subject) to account for repeated measures.\nTwelve subjects participated in this 11-year follow-up study (n\u00a0= 8 early ODT, n\u00a0= 4 early DBS+ODT). Participating subjects were 70.0\u00a0\u00b1 4.8 years old with a PD medication duration of 13.7\u00a0\u00b1 1.7 years (early DBS duration 11.5\u00a0\u00b1 1.3 years, n\u00a0= 4). Three early ODT subjects received STN-DBS as standard of care (DBS duration 6.5\u00a0\u00b1 2.0 years). Early ODT subjects had worse motor complications (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS]-IV) than early DBS+ODT subjects over the 11-year follow-up period (between-group difference\u00a0= 3.5 points; p\nEleven years after randomization, early DBS+ODT subjects had fewer motor complications than early ODT subjects. These results should be interpreted with caution because only 40% of pilot trial subjects participated in this 11-year follow-up study. The Food and Drug Administration has approved the conduct of a pivotal clinical trial evaluating DBS in early-stage PD (IDEG050016).\nThe Clinicaltrials.gov registration number for the study is NCT00282152.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGD) are a significant cause of disability and loss of quality of life (QoL) in Parkinson's Disease. Most research on clinical predictors of PIGD measures have focused on individual clinical often motor performance variables, However, PIGD motor features often result in fear of falling (FoF) lowering a patient's mobility self-efficacy. The purpose of this study was to assess composite measures of motor and self-efficacy determinants PIGD motor features in PD and compare these to analysis of individual clinical metrics.\n75 PD participants underwent detailed motor and non-motor test batteries. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify clusters of covarying correlates of slow walking, imbalance, falls, freezing of gait, FoG and compare these to traditional univariate analyses.\nA single PCA-derived composite measure of motor performance and self-efficacy of mobility was the most robust determinant of all PIGD motor features except for falls. In contrast, analysis of the individual clinical variables showed more limited and diverging findings, including evidence of better cognitive performance but more severe motor parkinsonian ratings in the fall group.\nThere are robust associations between composite measures of motor performance and self-efficacy of mobility and all PIGD motor features except for falls. Univariate analysis of individual clinical measures showed limited correlates of PIGD motor features. Patient's own perception of motor performance, FoF, and QoL deserve more attention as PIGD therapeutic targets in PD.",

Chaperones that increase GCase activity can potentially be disease-modifying agents in PD. To date, none of the registered treatments has demonstrated disease-modifying effects. Thus, chaperones for GCase were identified using in-silico virtual screening, molecular property filtering, and molecular dynamics and validated by circular dichroism, FT-IR, and Raman spectroscopies. In-vitro enzyme kinetics, thermal denaturation assay (TDA), and cell-line model were used to test their potential for GCase In-silico investigation revealed four compounds as candidate chaperones with adequate brain penetrability and binding energy (BE).

    "abstract": "To synthesize evidence from systematic reviews on the effects of qigong, tai chi, and yoga in people with neurological diseases.\nA systematic search was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library until September 2022. Methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool. A qualitative synthesis of included reviews and meta-analyses was performed. Citation matrices and the corrected covered area were used to explore the overlap of randomized controlled trials among reviews.\nNineteen systematic reviews (containing 74 trials and 80 meta-analyses) in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) or stroke were included. The critical domains of the AMSTAR 2 were not satisfied in more than half of the reviews, and only 4 evaluated the certainty of the evidence. The overlap was very high (21.7%) and high (11%) for tai chi studies in PD and stroke, respectively. In people with PD, qigong, yoga, and tai chi can improve balance, with tai chi being beneficial to increase functional mobility. For stroke patients, tai chi was better than controls to enhance motor function and independence, but not for health-related quality of life and quality of sleep. Findings on balance, walking ability and depression were inconclusive in stroke population.\nQigong, tai chi, and yoga appear to be effective to improve balance performance in people with PD. Tai chi practice enhances motor function and independency in stroke patients.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), pain is common, increases motor disability, and makes daily life unpleasant. Few patients reportedly have a low prevalence of abdominal pain. The pathophysiology of such abdominal pain has not been confirmed. We clinically studied patients with PD and persistent intolerable abdominal pain to determine the pathophysiology and effective therapy.\nWe obtained detailed clinical information from medical records, including the disease course before and after the onset of abdominal pain. The maximal thickness of the rectus muscle at the L4 and L5 corpus vertebral level of the abdomen on axial computed tomography was calculated, and the relative muscle thickness ratio was calculated by dividing the maximal thickness by the distance from the fascia between the bilateral rectus muscles of the abdomen and the dorsal part of the corpus vertebrae.\nIn six patients with PD (three men, age range 71-85 years), the Hoehn-Yahr stage, disease duration, and daily levodopa equivalent dose were 3.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7, 107\u00a0\u00b1\u00a044 months, and 636.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0451.4\u00a0mg/day, respectively. The pain occurred daily and often during the night and was not related to the timing of food intake. The pain in two patients was related to wearing-off. One patient showed constant hypertonic activity in the rectus abdominis on surface electromyography. The rectus abdominis showed that the maximal thickness and relative muscle thickness ratio of patients with abdominal pain were significantly higher than those of patients without pain. Therapeutic usefulness of antiparkinsonian medications was short and limited.\nAlthough intolerable abdominal pain is likely to be infrequent, it alleviates the quality of life of patients with PD. The pathophysiology seems to vary, and our observations found wearing-off of related pain and muscle contraction, suggesting dystonia. Among persistent abdominal pain, organic abnormalities, such as the precursor state of megacolon, may be lurking.",

    "abstract": "Clinical populations with basal ganglia pathologies may present with language production impairments, which are often described in combination with comprehension measures or attributed to motor, memory, or processing-speed problems. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we studied word production in four (vascular and non-vascular) pathologies of the basal ganglia: stroke affecting the basal ganglia, small vessel disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. We compared scores of these clinical populations with those of matched cognitively unimpaired adults on four well-established production tasks, namely picture naming, category fluency, letter fluency, and past-tense verb inflection. We conducted a systematic search in PubMed and PsycINFO with terms for basal ganglia structures, basal ganglia disorders and language production tasks. A total of 114 studies were included, containing results for one or more of the tasks of interest. For each pathology and task combination, effect sizes (Hedges' g) were extracted comparing patient versus control groups. For all four populations, performance was consistently worse than that of cognitively unimpaired adults across the four language production tasks (p-values\u2009<\u20090.010). Given that performance in picture naming and verb inflection across all pathologies was quantified in terms of accuracy, our results suggest that production impairments cannot be fully explained by motor or processing-speed deficits. Our review shows that while language production difficulties in these clinical populations are not negligible, more evidence is necessary to determine the exact mechanism that leads to these deficits and whether this mechanism is the same across different pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Practical methods for early identification of Parkinson's disease (PD) mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) through changes in real-life daily functioning are scarce. The aim of the study was to examine whether the cognitive functional (CF) feature, comprising of seven self-reported Movement Disorder Society's (MDS) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) items, predicts PD patients' cognitive functional status after a year. We conducted a 1-year follow-up of 34 PD patients (50-78\u00a0year; 70.6% men) suspected of MCI using the following measures: the MDS-UPDRS, UPDRS-CF feature, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Trail Making Test (TMT), Parkinson's Disease Cognitive Functional Rating Scale (PD-CFRS), and Daily Living Questionnaire (DLQ). The first and second UPDRS-CF feature scores, and additional measures at the 1-year follow-up significantly correlated. Hierarchical regression revealed that the initial MoCA, TMT, and BDI scores predicted the second UPDRS-CF, and the first UPDRS-CF predicted 31% of the second PD-CFRS score variance. Depression moderated the relationship between the first UPDRS-CF score and the DLQ Part A. These results suggest practical, self-reported, daily functional markers for identifying gradual decline in PD patients. They consider the patients' heterogeneity, underlying cognitive pathology, and implications on daily functioning, health, and well-being.",

    "abstract": "As the second-largest neurodegenerative disease in the world, Parkinson's disease (PD) has brought a severe economic and medical burden to our society. Growing evidence in recent years suggests that the gut microbiome may influence PD, but the exact pathogenesis of PD remains unclear. In addition, the current diagnosis of PD could be inaccurate and expensive. In this study, the largest meta-analysis currently of the gut microbiome in PD was analyzed, including 2269 samples by 16S rRNA gene and 236 samples by shotgun metagenomics, aiming to reveal the connection between PD and gut microbiome and establish a model to predict PD. The results showed that the relative abundances of potential pro-inflammatory bacteria, genes and pathways were significantly increased in PD, while potential anti-inflammatory bacteria, genes and pathways were significantly decreased. These changes may lead to a decrease in potential anti-inflammatory substances (short-chain fatty acids) and an increase in potential pro-inflammatory substances (lipopolysaccharides, hydrogen sulfide and glutamate). Notably, the results of 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic analysis have consistently identified five decreased genera (Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Lachnospira, and Prevotella) and five increased genera (Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, and Desulfovibrio) in PD. Furthermore, random forest models performed well for PD prediction based on 11 genera (accuracy > 80%) or 6 genes (accuracy > 90%) related to inflammation. Finally, a possible mechanism was presented to explain the pathogenesis of inflammation leading to PD. Our results provided further insights into the prediction and treatment of PD based on inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease which is characterized by selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The intrinsic neuronal firing activity is critical for the functional organization of brain and the specific deficits of neuronal firing activity may be associated with different brain disorders. It is known that the surviving nigra dopaminergic neurons exhibit altered firing activity, such as decreased spontaneous firing frequency, reduced number of firing neurons and increased burst firing in Parkinson's disease. Several ionic mechanisms are involved in changed firing activity of dopaminergic neurons under parkinsonian state. In this review, we summarize the changes of spontaneous firing activity as well as the possible mechanisms of nigra dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. This review may let us clearly understand the involvement of neuronal firing activity of nigra dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has been applied successfully in treating refractory tremors in Parkinson disease (PD). It generates a precise thermal ablation in a specific nucleus or tract, such as ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) or pallidothalamic tract (PTT). Despite a single lesion improving parts of the PD symptoms, the feasibility and efficacy of a stepwise dual-lesion in VIM and PTT are yet to be explored.\nThree patients with tremor-dominant PD (aged 60.7 \u00b1 6.0 years) received dual-target MRgFUS treatment with a series of primary and secondary outcome measures. The VIM and PTT were navigated based on individual magnetic resonance imaging planning of the brain. The primary outcome measures were the off-status Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III). The secondary outcome measures included UPDRS I, II, IV, Hohen and Yahr score, Neuropsychiatry Inventory, Quality of life in PD Rating Scale, Non-Motor Symptoms Scale, and Clinical Global Impression. The baseline data were compared with those acquired 1 day and 1 month following the treatment.\nThe severity of tremor and motor deficits represented by Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor-part B and UPDRS III were significantly improved (P < 0.05 by nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests) after dual-target ablations. The nonmotor symptoms investigated by UPDRS II and Non-Motor Symptoms Scale also showed significant improvement at the 1-day and 1-month follow-up. There was no adverse effect except temporary procedure-related headache and dizziness during the treatment.\nStepwise dual-lesion targeting VIM and PTT is a safe and effective MRgFUS therapeutic strategy for patients with PD.",

We used ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography linked to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) for measuring relative concentrations of \u22641.5 kDalton biochemicals. A reference library created from authentic standards facilitated chemical identifications. Analytes underwent univariate analysis for PD association, with false discovery rate-adjusted p-value (\u22640.05) determinations. Multivariate analysis (for identifying a panel of biochemicals discriminating PD from HCs) used several biostatistical methods, including logistic LASSO regression.\nComparing PD and HCs, strong differentiation was achieved from CSF but not serum specimens. With univariate analysis, 21 CSF compounds exhibited significant differential concentrations. Logistic LASSO regression led to selection of 23 biochemicals (11 shared with those determined by the univariate analysis). The selected compounds, as a group, distinguished PD from HCs, with Area-Under-the-Receiver-Operating-Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.897. With optimal cutoff, logistic LASSO achieved 100% sensitivity and 96% specificity (and positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 100%). Ten-fold cross-validation gave 84% sensitivity and 82% specificity (and 82% positive and 84% negative predictive values). From the logistic LASSO-chosen regression model, 2 polyamine metabolites (N-acetylcadaverine and N-acetylputrescine) were chosen and had the highest fold-changes in comparing PD to HCs. Another chosen biochemical, acisoga (N-(3-acetamidopropyl)pyrrolidine-2-one), also is a polyamine metabolism derivative.\nUHPLC-MS/MS assays provided a metabolomic signature highly predictive of PD.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized in part by the deterioration of dopaminergic neurons which leads to motor impairment. Although there is no cure for PD, the motor symptoms can be treated using dopamine replacement therapies including the dopamine precursor L-DOPA, which has been in use since the 1960s. However, neurodegeneration in PD is not limited to dopaminergic neurons, and many patients experience non-motor symptoms including cognitive impairment or neuropsychiatric disturbances, for which there are limited treatment options. Moreover, there are currently no treatments able to alter the progression of neurodegeneration. There are many therapeutic strategies being investigated for PD, including alternatives to L-DOPA for the treatment of motor impairment, symptomatic treatments for non-motor symptoms, and neuroprotective or disease-modifying agents. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which include the dopamine receptors, are highly druggable cell surface proteins which can regulate numerous intracellular signaling pathways and thereby modulate the function of neuronal circuits affected by PD. This review will describe the treatment strategies being investigated for PD that target GPCRs and their downstream signaling mechanisms. First, we discuss new developments in dopaminergic agents for alleviating PD motor impairment, the role of dopamine receptors in L-DOPA induced dyskinesia, as well as agents targeting non-dopamine GPCRs which could augment or replace traditional dopaminergic treatments. We then discuss GPCRs as prospective treatments for neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms in PD. Finally, we discuss the evidence pertaining to ghrelin receptors, \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, angiotensin receptors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors, which have been proposed as disease modifying targets with potential neuroprotective effects in PD.",

    "abstract": "Impairments in respiration, voice and speech are common in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nTo evaluate the prevalence of dysphonia, assessed by a specific acoustic evaluation and description of the voice by the speech therapist (GIRBAS), and its relation with lung function and oxygenation, in particular cough ability and during the night or exercise desaturation.\nThis is a posthoc analysis of a prospective cross-sectional observational study on PD patients collecting anthropometric and clinical data, comorbidities, PD severity, motor function and balance, respiratory function at rest, during exercise and at night, voice function with acoustic analysis and presence of speech disorders, in addition to the GIRBAS scale. Based on GIRBAS Global dysphonia ('G') score, we divided patients into dysphonic (moderate-to-severe deviance from the euphonic condition) vs. no/mild dysphonic and analyzed the relations with respiratory impairments.\nWe analyzed 55 patients and found significant impairments in both respiratory and voice/speech functions. Most patients (85.5%) presented mild-to-severe deviance from the euphonic condition in at least one GIRBAS perceptual element (80% of cases for Global dysphonia) and only 14.5% did not show deviance in all elements simultaneously. At Odds Ratio analysis, the risk of presenting nocturnal desaturation and reduced peak cough expiratory flow was approximately 24 and 8 times higher, respectively, in dysphonic patients vs. those with no/mild dysphonia.\nPerceptual and qualitative evaluation of the voice with GIRBAS showed that mild-to-severe dysphonia was highly prevalent in PD patients, and associated with nocturnal oxygen desaturation and poor cough ability.",

    "abstract": "For controlling symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) together with treating additional comorbidities, patients often face complex medication regimens, with suboptimal adherence, drug-related problems, and diminished therapy efficacy as a common consequence. A medication review could potentially tackle these issues, among others by optimizing drug treatment. Even if no change in clinical outcomes is observed, this intervention might decrease health care costs by reducing drug-related problems and hospital admissions. This study aimed to gain more insight in the health benefits and costs of a structured medication review (SMR) in PD.\nA cost-utility analysis was performed, based on a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 202 PD patients with polypharmacy. The intervention group received an SMR, whereas the control group received usual care. The intervention effect after 6\u00a0months of follow-up was presented as incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Costs were based on real-world data. Missing data was imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was used to estimate the uncertainty in all health and economic outcomes.\nThe QALY gain in the intervention group compared to the control group was\u2009-\u20090.011 (95% CI\u2009-\u20090.043; 0.020). Incremental costs were \u20ac433 (95% CI\u2009-\u2009873; 1687). When adapting a willingness-to-pay threshold of \u20ac20,000/QALY and \u20ac80,000/QALY, the probability of SMRs being cost-effective was 18% and 30%, respectively.\nA community pharmacist-led SMR in PD patients in the current setting shows no apparent benefit and is not cost-effective after 6\u00a0months, compared to usual care.\nNetherlands Trial Register, NL4360.

    "abstract": "Uncertainty prevails regarding the patterns of autonomic dysfunction in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). This study was undertaken with the aim of assessing the complete spectrum of cardiovascular autonomic function tests (CAFTs) and blood pressure variability patterns in IPD patients while comparing the same with age-matched controls.\nPatients with IPD presenting to the Christian Medical College and Hospital from December 2016 to November 2018 along with age-matched controls were prospectively evaluated using CAFTs. The IPD patients also underwent ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (ABPM), and the diurnal systolic BP differences were used to classify into dippers (10-20%), non-dippers (0-10%), reverse dippers (<0%), and extreme dippers (>20%).\nAutonomic dysfunction (AD) was prevalent in 41 (68.3%) IPD patients even in early disease (median (inter-quartile range) symptom duration 2 (1-4) years, mean Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage 2 (1.5-2.8). Both sympathetic and parasympathetic parameters were impaired among IPD patients when compared to healthy controls. (E: I ratio 1.17 \u00b1 0.12 vs 1.26 \u00b1 0.14 (\nTimely detection of AD may be helpful not only in recognizing IPD in its pre-motor stages but also in optimizing management for this population of patients. BP variability and abnormal dipping patterns on ABPM can be a potential marker of dysautonomia.",

    "abstract": "Speech disorder is a significant problem for people affected with Parkinson's disease (PD) leading to a substantial disability to communicate with others. PD affects the voice, including changes in pitch, intensity, articulation, and syllable rate.We aimed to study the current status of artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning algorithms (MLAs) in the assessment of speech abnormalities in PD along with the generation of intelligible synthetic speech for voice rehabilitation. We searched the literature for studies focusing on speech/voice disorder in PD and rehabilitation techniques till June 18, 2022. We searched PubMed and Engineering Village (Compendex and Inspec combined) databases. After careful screening of the title and evaluation of abstracts, we used select articles describing the use of AI or its various forms in the management of speech abnormalities in PD to synthesize this review. MLAs classify PD and non-PD patients with an accuracy of more than 90% using only voice features. Non-acoustic sensors can rehabilitate PD patient by converting dysarthric speech to highly intelligible speech using MLAs. MLAs can automatically assess several speech features and quantify the progression of speech abnormalities in PD. PD speech rehabilitation using MLAs may prove superior to other available therapies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. In India, an accurate number of PD patients remains uncertain owing to the unawareness of PD symptoms in the geriatric population and the large discrepancy between the number of PD patients and trained neurologists. Constructing additional neurological care centers along with using technology and integrating it into digital healthcare platforms will help reduce this burden. Use of technology in PD diagnosis and monitoring started in 1980s with invasive techniques performed in laboratories. Over the last five decades, PD technology has significantly evolved where now patients can track symptoms using their smartphones or wearable sensors. However, the use of such technology within the Indian population is non-existent primarily due to the cost of digital devices and limited technological capabilities of geriatric patients especially in rural areas. Other reasons include secure data transfers from patients to physicians and the general lack of awareness of wearables devices. Thus, creating a simple, cost-effective and inconspicuous wearable device would yield the highest compliance within the Indian PD patient population. Implementation of such technology will provide neurologists with wider outreach to patients in rural locations, remote monitoring and empirical data to titrate medication.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurological diseases, described by complex clinical phenotypes. The manifestations of PD include both motor and non-motor symptoms. We constituted an experimental protocol for the assessment of PD motor signs of lower extremities. Using a pair of sensor insoles, data were recorded from PD patients, Elderly and Adult groups. Assessment of PD patients has been performed by neurologists specialized in movement disorders using the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)-Part III: Motor Examination, on both ON and OFF medication states. Using as a reference point the quantified metrics of MDS-UPDRS-Part III, severity levels were explored by classifying normal, mild, moderate, and severe levels of PD. Elaborating the recorded gait data, 18 temporal and spatial characteristics have been extracted. Subsequently, feature selection techniques were applied to reveal the dominant features to be used for four classification tasks. Specifically, for identifying relations between the spatial and temporal gait features on: PD and non-PD groups; PD, Elderly and Adults groups; PD and ON/OFF medication states; MDS-UPDRS: Part III and PD severity levels. AdaBoost, Extra Trees, and Random Forest classifiers, were trained and tested. Results showed a recognition accuracy of 88%, 73% and 81% for, the PD and non-PD groups, PD-related medication states, and PD severity levels relevant to MDS-UPDRS: Part III ratings, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic posturography combined with wearable sensors has high sensitivity in recognizing subclinical balance abnormalities in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, this approach is burdened by a high analytical load for motion analysis, potentially limiting a routine application in clinical practice. In this study, we used machine learning to distinguish PD patients from controls, as well as patients under and not under dopaminergic therapy (i.e., ON and OFF states), based on kinematic measures recorded during dynamic posturography through portable sensors. We compared 52 different classifiers derived from Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network with different kernel functions to automatically analyze reactive postural responses to yaw perturbations recorded through IMUs in 20 PD patients and 15 healthy subjects. To identify the most efficient machine learning algorithm, we applied three threshold-based selection criteria (i.e., accuracy, recall and precision) and one evaluation criterion (i.e., goodness index). Twenty-one out of 52 classifiers passed the three selection criteria based on a threshold of 80%. Among these, only nine classifiers were considered \"optimum\" in distinguishing PD patients from healthy subjects according to a goodness index \u2264 0.25. The Fine K-Nearest Neighbor was the best-performing algorithm in the automatic classification of PD patients and healthy subjects, irrespective of therapeutic condition. By contrast, none of the classifiers passed the three threshold-based selection criteria in the comparison of patients in ON and OFF states. Overall, machine learning is a suitable solution for the early identification of balance disorders in PD through the automatic analysis of kinematic data from dynamic posturography.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa administration is currently the most common treatment to alleviate Parkinson's Disease (PD) symptoms. Nevertheless, prolonged use of Levodopa leads to a wearing-off (WO) phenomenon, causing symptoms to reappear. To build a personalized treatment plan aiming to manage PD and its symptoms effectively, there is a need for a technological system able to continuously and objectively assess the WO phenomenon during daily life. In this context, this paper proposes a WO tracker able to exploit neuromuscular data acquired by a dedicated wireless sensor network to discriminate between a Levodopa benefit phase and the reappearance of symptoms. The proposed architecture has been implemented on a heterogeneous computing platform, that statistically analyzes neural and muscular features to identify the best set of features to train the classifier model. Eight models among shallow and deep learning approaches are analyzed in terms of performance, timing and complexity metrics to identify the best inference engine. Experimental results on five subjects experiencing WO, showed that, in the best case, the proposed WO tracker can achieve an accuracy of ~84%, providing the inference in less than 41 ms. It is possible by employing a simple fully-connected neural network with 1 hidden layer and 32 units.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), in conjunction with circulating microbubbles, is an emerging technology that can transiently enhance the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) locally and non-invasively to facilitate targeted drug delivery to the brain. In this clinical trial, the feasibility and safety of BBB modulation in the putamen were evaluated for biweekly therapeutic agent delivery in patients with Parkinson's disease. The performance of the clinical MRgFUS system's cavitation feedback controller for active power modulation throughout the exposures was examined. The putamen was targeted unilaterally by an ExAblate Neuro MRgFUS system operating at 220 kHz. Definity microbubbles were infused via a saline bag gravity drip at a rate of 4 \u00b5L/kg per 5 min. A cavitation emissions-based feedback controller was employed to modulate the acoustic power automatically according to prescribed target cavitation dose levels. BBB opening was measured by Gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging, and the presence of potential micro-hemorrhages induced by the exposures was assessed via T2*-weighted MR imaging. A total of 12 treatment sessions were carried out across four patients, with target cavitation dose levels ranging from 0.20-0.40. BBB permeability in the targeted putamen was elevated successfully in all treatments, with a 14% \u00b1 6% mean increase in Gd-enhanced T1-weighted MRI signal intensity relative to the untreated contralateral side. No indications of red blood cell extravasations were observed on MR imaging scans acquired one day following each treatment session. The cavitation emissions-based feedback controller was effective in modulating acoustic power levels to ensure BBB permeability enhancement while avoiding micro-hemorrhages, however, further technical advancements are warranted to improve its performance for use across a wide variety of brain diseases.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the prevalence of which is rapidly rising due to an aging world population and westernization of lifestyles, are expected to put a strong socioeconomic burden on health systems worldwide. Clinical trials of therapies against PD and AD have only shown limited success so far. Therefore, research has extended its scope to a systems medicine point of view, with a particular focus on the gastrointestinal-brain axis as a potential main actor in disease development and progression. Microbiome and metabolome studies have already revealed important insights into disease mechanisms. Both the microbiome and metabolome can be easily manipulated by dietary and lifestyle interventions, and might thus offer novel, readily available therapeutic options to prevent the onset as well as the progression of PD and AD. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the interplay between microbiota, metabolites, and neurodegeneration along the gastrointestinal-brain axis. We further illustrate state-of-the art methods of microbiome and metabolome research as well as metabolic modeling that facilitate the identification of disease pathomechanisms. We conclude with therapeutic options to modulate microbiome composition to prevent or delay neurodegeneration and illustrate potential future research directions to fight PD and AD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. Visual disturbance is one of the most frequent nonmotor abnormalities referred to by patients suffering from PD at early stages. Furthermore, ocular surface alterations including mainly dry eye and blink reduction represent another common finding in patients with PD. Tears of PD patients show specific alterations related to protein composition, and in vivo confocal microscopy has demonstrated profound changes in different corneal layers in this setting. These changes can be attributed not only to the disease itself, but also to the medications used for its management. In particular, signs of corneal toxicity, both at epithelial and endothelial level, are well described in the literature in PD patients receiving amantadine. Management of PD patients from the ophthalmologist's side requires knowledge of the common, but often underdiagnosed, ocular surface alterations as well as of the signs of drug toxicity. Furthermore, ocular surface biomarkers can be useful for the early diagnosis of PD as well as for monitoring the degree of neural degeneration over time.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD). Glial cell activation and subsequent adaptive immune involvement are neuroinflammatory features in familial and idiopathic PD, resulting in the death of dopaminergic neuron cells. An oxidative stress response, inflammatory mediator production, and immune cell recruitment and activation are all hallmarks of this activation, leading to chronic neuroinflammation and progressive neurodegeneration. Several studies in PD patients' cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood revealed alterations in inflammatory markers and immune cell populations that may lead to or exacerbate neuroinflammation and perpetuate the neurodegenerative process. Most of the genes causing PD are also expressed in astrocytes and microglia, converting their neuroprotective role into a pathogenic one and contributing to disease onset and progression. Nuclear receptor-related transcription factor 1 (NURR1) regulates gene expression linked to dopaminergic neuron genesis and functional maintenance. In addition to playing a key role in developing and maintaining neurotransmitter phenotypes in dopaminergic neurons, NURR1 agonists have been shown to reverse behavioral and histological abnormalities in animal PD models. NURR1 protects dopaminergic neurons from inflammation-induced degeneration, specifically attenuating neuronal death by suppressing the expression of inflammatory genes in microglia and astrocytes. This narrative review highlights the inflammatory changes in PD and the advances in NURR1-regulated neuroinflammation associated with PD. Further, we present new evidence that targeting this inflammation with a variety of potential NURR1 target therapy medications can effectively slow the progression of chronic neuroinflammation-induced PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson\u2019s disease is a chronic, progressive, and neurodegenerative disease, and yet with an imprecise etiopathogenesis. Although neuroinflammation was initially thought to be a secondary condition, it is now believed that microglia-induced inflammation could also contribute to the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway. Here, we aimed to establish the feasibility of basic inflammatory biomarkers as prognostic factors in PD. The study was based on retrospective analyses of blood samples taken from patients diagnosed with PD, as well as from healthy subjects. Complete medical records, total leukocyte count with subpopulations, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were analyzed. We calculated the serum neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio (NLR) and platelet-to lymphocytes ratio (PLR), and also compared the laboratory data between the PD group and the control group. Only PLR and NLR showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.001 and 0.04, respectively). In our study, ESR did not show statistically significant correlations with motor score or with disability. In our research, ESR was correlated with the disease duration (p = 0.04), and PLR showed a significant correlation with disease stage (p = 0.027) and disease duration (p = 0.001), but not with motor state. These biomarkers could prove to be effective tools for a primary evaluation of inflammation in PD, but further tests are required to properly investigate the neuroinflammatory status of these patients.",

    "abstract": "(1) Background: The dynamics of hand tremors involve nonrandom and short-term motor patterns (STMPs). This study aimed to (i) identify STMPs in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and physiological resting tremor and (ii) characterize STMPs by amplitude, persistence, and regularity. (2) Methods: This study included healthy (N = 12, 60.1 \u00b1 5.9 years old) and PD (N = 14, 65 \u00b1 11.54 years old) participants. The signals were collected using a triaxial gyroscope on the dorsal side of the hand during a resting condition. Data were preprocessed and seven features were extracted from each 1 s window with 50% overlap. The STMPs were identified using the clustering technique k-means applied to the data in the two-dimensional space given by t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). The frequency, transition probability, and duration of the STMPs for each group were assessed. All STMP features were averaged across groups. (3) Results: Three STMPs were identified in tremor signals (p < 0.05). STMP 1 was prevalent in the healthy control (HC) subjects, STMP 2 in both groups, and STMP3 in PD. Only the coefficient of variation and complexity differed significantly between groups. (4) Conclusion: These results can help professionals characterize and evaluate tremor severity and treatment efficacy.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess the accuracy of determining accessory pathway (AP) localization from 12 lead ECG tracings by applying 12 different algorithms in pediatric patients diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. We compared algorithm accuracy in electrophysiologic study ECG tracings with full preexcitation and resting ECG tracings. The assessing pediatric cardiologists were blinded regarding EP study results on AP localization. For exact AP location, the algorithms published by D'Avila et al. and Boersma et al. yielded the highest accuracy (58%). Distinguishing laterality, the median accuracy for predicting left or right-sided APs was 74%, while for septal APs it was 68%. We conclude that algorithms predicting AP location in pediatric patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome show low accuracy for exact AP localization. For laterality, however, accuracy was significantly higher.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a beneficial procedure for treating idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), essential tremor, and dystonia. The authors describe their set of imaging modalities used for a frameless and fiducial-less method of DBS. CT and MRI scans are obtained preoperatively, and STN parcellation is done based on diffusion tractography. During the surgery, an intraoperative cone-beam computed tomography scan is obtained and merged with the preoperatively-acquired images to place electrodes using a frameless and fiducial-less system. Accuracy is evaluated prospectively. The described sequence of imaging methods shows excellent accuracy compared to the frame-based techniques.",

Different types of early symptoms, such as speech impairment and changes in writing, are associated with Parkinson disease. To classify potential patients of PD, many researchers used machine learning algorithms in various datasets related to this disease. In our research, we study the dataset of the PD vocal impairment feature, which is an imbalanced dataset. We propose comparative performance evaluation using various decision tree ensemble methods, with or without oversampling techniques. In addition, we compare the performance of classifiers with different sizes of ensembles and various ratios of the minority class and the majority class with oversampling and undersampling. Finally, we combine feature selection with best-performing ensemble classifiers. The result shows that AdaBoost, random forest, and decision tree developed for the RUSBoost imbalanced dataset perform well in performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the geometric mean. Further, feature selection methods, namely lasso and information gain, were used to screen the 10 best features using the best ensemble classifiers. AdaBoost with information gain feature selection method is the best performing ensemble method with an F1-score of 0.903.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a gradually progressing neurodegenerative condition that is marked by a loss of motor coordination along with non-motor features. Although the precise cause of PD has not been determined, the disease condition is mostly associated with the exposure to environmental toxins, such as metals, and their abnormal accumulation in the brain. Heavy metals, such as iron (Fe), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and lead (Pb), have been linked to PD and contribute to its progression. In addition, the interactions among the components of a metal mixture may result in synergistic toxicity. Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated a connection between PD and either single or mixed exposure to these heavy metals, which increase the prevalence of PD. Chronic exposure to heavy metals is related to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines resulting in neuronal loss through neuroinflammation. Similarly, metals disrupt redox homeostasis while inducing free radical production and decreasing antioxidant levels in the substantia nigra. Furthermore, these metals alter molecular processes and result in oxidative stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis, which can potentially trigger dopaminergic neurodegenerative disorders. This review focuses on the roles of Hg, Pb, Mn, Cu, and Fe in the development and progression of PD. Moreover, it explores the plausible roles of heavy metals in neurodegenerative mechanisms that facilitate the development of PD. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying metal toxicities will enable the establishment of novel therapeutic approaches to prevent or cure PD.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress and gut dysbiosis have been known to precede Parkinson's disease (PD). An antioxidant-rich product, mangosteen pericarp (MP), has the ability to counterbalance excessive free radicals and the imbalanced gut microbiota composition, suggesting the MP's capacity to delay PD progression. In this study, we explored the effects of two doses of MP extract in a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rat model. We revealed that the 8-week supplementation of a low dose (LMP) and a high dose of the MP extract (HMP) improved motor function, as observed in decreased contralateral rotation, improved time spent on rod, and higher dopamine binding transporter (DAT) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The MP extract, especially the HMP, also increased antioxidant-related gene expressions, restored muscle mitochondrial function, and remodeled fecal microbiota composition, which were followed by reduced reactive oxygen species levels in brain and inflammation in plasma. Importantly, bacterial genera ",

    "abstract": "As the global population grows, there is an increasing demand for neurologic consultation that prompts new ways to reach more patients. Telemedicine can provide an accessible, cost-effective, and high-quality healthcare services.\nIn this article, we highlight recent developments, achievements, and challenges regarding outcomes, clinical care, tele-education, teletreatment, teleresearch, and cybersecurity for telemedicine applied to Parkinson\u00b4s disease (PD) and other neurological conditions.\nA growing body of evidence supports the feasibility and effectiveness of telemedicine tools for PD and other movement disorders. Outcome variables regarding satisfaction and efficacy in clinical care and specific issues about education, research, and treatment are reviewed. Additionally, a specific legal framework for teleconsultation has been developed in some centers worldwide. Yet, the implementation of telemedicine is conditioned by the limitations inherent to remote neurological examination, the variable computer usage literacy among patients, and the availability of a reliable internet connection. At present, telemedicine can be considered an additional tool in the clinical management of PD patients.\nThere is an increasing use of remote clinical practice regarding the management of PD and other neurological conditions. Telemedicine is a new and promising tool aimed at special settings and subpopulations.",

    "abstract": "Intra- and perioperatively recorded local field potential (LFP) activity of the nucleus subthalamicus (STN) has been suggested to guide contact selection in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the invention of sensing capacities in chronically implanted devices, a comprehensible algorithm that enables contact selection using such recordings is still lacking. We evaluated a fully automated algorithm that uses the weighted average of bipolar recordings to determine effective monopolar contacts based on elevated activity in the beta band. LFPs from 14 hemispheres in seven PD patients with newly implanted directional DBS leads of the STN were recorded. First, the algorithm determined the stimulation level with the highest beta activity. Based on the prior determined level, the directional contact with the highest beta activity was chosen in the second step. The mean clinical efficacy of the contacts chosen using the algorithm did not statistically differ from the mean clinical efficacy of standard contact selection as performed in clinical routine. All recording sites were projected into MNI standard space to investigate the feasibility of the algorithm with respect to the anatomical boundaries of the STN. We conclude that the proposed algorithm is a first step towards LFP-based contact selection in STN-DBS for PD using chronically implanted devices.",

    "abstract": "Skin erosion is a hardware-related complication commonly described after deep brain stimulation (DBS). Hardware exposure is often associated with the development of infection that can lead to implant removal. However, in selected cases, it is possible to manage skin erosion without having to remove the hardware. This article presents the case of a patient with recurrent skin erosions above the IPG, who underwent multiple surgeries. Given the failure of less invasive approaches, a more complex surgery with the employment of a pedunculated flap of pectoralis major in order to cover the IPG was attempted. Nevertheless, the IPG removal was finally unavoidable, resulting in a rapid decline in clinical performance. This illustrative case suggests how, in patients with sustained stimulation who benefit from a good degree of autonomy, it may be useful to use invasive surgical techniques to resolve skin erosions and save the DBS system. In spite of everything, sometimes complete or partial removal of the implant still becomes unavoidable, but this can lead to a severe worsening of PD symptoms. Definitive removal of the system should therefore be considered only in cases of frank infection or after failure of all other approaches.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is complex, multilayered, and not fully understood, resulting in a lack of effective disease-modifying treatments for this prevalent neurodegenerative condition. Symptoms of PD are heterogenous, including motor impairment as well as non-motor symptoms such as depression, cognitive impairment, and circadian disruption. Aging and stress are important risk factors for PD, leading us to explore pathways that may either accelerate or protect against cellular aging and the detrimental effects of stress. Cortisol is a much-studied hormone that can disrupt mitochondrial function and increase oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, which are recognized as key underlying disease mechanisms in PD. The more recently discovered klotho protein, considered a general aging-suppressor, has a similarly wide range of actions but in the opposite direction to cortisol: promoting mitochondrial function while reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Both hormones also converge on pathways of vitamin D metabolism and insulin resistance, also implicated to play a role in PD. Interestingly, aging, stress and PD associate with an increase in cortisol and decrease in klotho, while physical exercise and certain genetic variations lead to a decrease in cortisol response and increased klotho. Here, we review the interrelated opposite actions of cortisol and klotho in the pathogenesis of PD. Together they impact powerful and divergent mechanisms that may go on to influence PD-related symptoms. Better understanding of these hormones in PD would facilitate the design of effective interventions that can simultaneously impact the multiple systems involved in the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by motor and cognitive deficits that usually have an impact on quality of life and independence. To reduce impairment, various rehabilitation programs have been proposed, but their effects on both cognitive and motor aspects have not been systematically investigated. Furthermore, most intervention is focused on lower limb treatment rather than upper limbs. In the present study, we investigated the effect of 3-week upper limb vibratory stimulation training on cognitive functioning in 20 individuals with Parkinson's disease. We analyzed cognitive (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trial Making Test, Digit Symbol, Digit Span Forward and Backward and Alertness) and motor performance (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-part III; Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire) before treatment, at the end of treatment and one month post treatment. After rehabilitation, a statistically significant improvement was observed in terms of global cognitive status, attention, global motor functioning and disability. The results suggest an impact of upper limb motor rehabilitation on cognition in Parkinson's disease. Future studies on neuromotor interventions should investigate their effects on cognitive functioning to improve understanding of cognitive motor interaction in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To determine the short- and medium-term therapeutic effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on restless legs syndrome (RLS) in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and to study the optimal position of activated contacts for RLS symptoms. Methods: We preoperatively and postoperatively assessed PD Patients with RLS undergoing STN-DBS. Additionally, we recorded the stimulation parameters that induced RLS or relieved RLS symptoms during a follow-up. Finally, we reconstructed the activated contacts\u2019 position that reduced or induced RLS symptoms. Results: 363 PD patients were enrolled. At the 1-year follow-up, we found that the IRLS sum significantly decreased in the RLS group (preoperative 18.758 \u00b1 7.706, postoperative 8.121 \u00b1 7.083, p < 0.05). The results of the CGI score, MOS sleep, and RLS QLQ all showed that the STN-DBS improved RLS symptoms after one year. Furthermore, the activated contacts that relieved RLS were mainly located in the central sensorimotor region of the STN. Activated contacts in the inferior sensorimotor part of the STN or in the substantia nigra might have induced RLS symptoms. Conclusions: STN-DBS improved RLS in patients with PD in one year, which reduced their sleep disorders and increased their quality of life. Furthermore, the central sensorimotor region part of the STN is the optimal stimulation site.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation (STN-DBS), in addition to a rapid improvement of Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms, can exert fast, local, neuromodulator activity, reducing \u03b2-synchronous oscillations between STN and the motor cortex with possible antikinetic features. However, STN-DBS modulation of \u03b2-band synchronization in extramotor cortical areas has been scarcely explored. For this aim, we investigated DBS-induced short-term effects on EEG-based cortical functional connectivity (FC) in \u03b2 bands in six PD patients who underwent STN-DBS within the past year. A 10 min, 64-channel EEG recording was performed twice: in DBS-OFF and 60 min after DBS activation. Seven age-matched controls performed EEG recordings as the control group. A source-reconstruction method was used to identify brain-region activity. The FC was calculated using a weighted phase-lag index in \u03b2 bands. Group comparisons were made using the Wilcoxon test. The PD patients showed a widespread cortical hyperconnectivity in \u03b2 bands in both DBS-OFF and -ON states compared to the controls. Moreover, switching on STN-DBS determined an acute reduction in \u03b2 FC, primarily involving corticocortical links of frontal, sensorimotor and limbic lobes. We hypothesize that an increase in \u03b2-band connectivity in PD is a widespread cortical phenomenon and that STN-DBS could quickly reduce it in the cortical regions primarily involved in basal ganglia-cortical circuits.",

    "abstract": "The use of cannabinoids as therapeutic drugs has increased among aging populations recently. Age-related changes in the endogenous cannabinoid system could influence the effects of therapies that target the cannabinoid system. At the preclinical level, cannabidiol (CBD) induces anti-amyloidogenic, antioxidative, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role of cannabinoids to neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer. Emerging evidence suggests that CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol have neuroprotective therapeutic-like effects on dementias. In clinical practice, cannabinoids are being used off-label to relieve symptoms of PD and AD. In fact, patients are using cannabis compounds for the treatment of tremor, non-motor symptoms, anxiety, and sleep assistance in PD, and managing responsive behaviors of dementia such as agitation. However, strong evidence from clinical trials is scarce for most indications. Some clinicians consider cannabinoids an alternative for older adults bearing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's dementia with a poor response to first-line treatments. In our concept and experience, cannabinoids should never be considered a first-line treatment but could be regarded as an adjuvant therapy in specific situations commonly seen in clinical practice. To mitigate the risk of adverse events, the traditional dogma of geriatric medicine, starting with a low dose and proceeding with a slow titration regime, should also be employed with cannabinoids. In this review, we aimed to address preclinical evidence of cannabinoids in neurodegenerative disorders such as PD and AD and discuss potential off-label use of cannabinoids in clinical practice of these disorders.",

    "abstract": "Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder characterized by a composite and multisystemic clinical phenotype and frequent involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). Research in this area has largely focused on the cerebrovascular manifestations of the disease, and very little has been described about further neurological manifestations, which are known in other lysosomal diseases, such as Gaucher disease. In particular, a clinical and neuroimaging phenotype suggesting neurodegeneration as a putative mechanism has never been fully described for AFD, but the increased survival of affected patients with early diagnosis and the possibility of treatment have given rise to some isolated reports in the literature on the association of AFD with a clinical phenotype of Parkinson disease (PD). The data are currently scarce, but it is possible to hypothesize the molecular mechanisms of cell damage that support this association; this topic is worthy of further study in particular in relation to the therapeutic possibilities, which have significantly modified the natural history of the disease but which are not specifically dedicated to the CNS. In this review, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association will be proposed, and the available data with implications for future research and treatment will be rewritten.",

    "abstract": "The prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by many non-motor symptoms, and these have recently been posited to be predictive of later diagnosis. Genetic rodent models can develop non-motor phenotypes, providing tools to identify mechanisms underlying the early development of PD. However, it is not yet clear how reproducible non-motor phenotypes are amongst genetic PD rodent models, whether phenotypes are age-dependent, and the translatability of these phenotypes has yet to be explored. A systematic literature search was conducted on studies using genetic PD rodent models to investigate non-motor phenotypes; cognition, anxiety/depressive-like behaviour, gastrointestinal (GI) function, olfaction, circadian rhythm, cardiovascular and urinary function. In total, 51 genetic models of PD across 150 studies were identified. We found outcomes of most phenotypes were inconclusive due to inadequate studies, assessment at different ages, or variation in experimental and environmental factors. GI dysfunction was the most reproducible phenotype across all genetic rodent models. The mouse model harbouring mutant A53T, and the wild-type h\u03b1-syn overexpression (OE) model recapitulated the majority of phenotypes, albeit did not reliably produce concurrent motor deficits and nigral cell loss. Furthermore, animal models displayed different phenotypic profiles, reflecting the distinct genetic risk factors and heterogeneity of disease mechanisms. Currently, the inconsistent phenotypes within rodent models pose a challenge in the translatability and usefulness for further biomechanistic investigations. This review highlights opportunities to improve phenotype reproducibility with an emphasis on phenotypic assay choice and robust experimental design.",

    "abstract": "Plasma from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is a valuable source of information indicating altered metabolites associated with the risk or progression of the disease. Neurotoxicity of dopaminergic neurons, which is triggered by aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein, is the main pathogenic feature of PD. However, a growing body of scientific reports indicates that metabolic changes may precede and directly contribute to neurodegeneration. Identification and characterization of the abnormal metabolic pattern in patients' plasma are therefore crucial for the search for potential PD biomarkers. The aims of the present study were (1) to identify metabolic alterations in plasma metabolome in subjects with PD as compared with the controls; (2) to find new potential markers, some correlations among them; (3) to identify metabolic pathways relevant to the pathophysiology of PD. Plasma samples from patients with PD (",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease of high prevalence, characterized by the prominent death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which produces dopamine deficiency, leading to classic motor symptoms. Although PD has traditionally been considered as a neuronal cell autonomous pathology, in which the damage of vulnerable neurons is responsible for the disease, growing evidence strongly suggests that astrocytes might have an active role in the neurodegeneration observed. In the present review, we discuss several studies evidencing astrocyte implications in PD, highlighting the consequences of both the loss of normal homeostatic functions and the gain in toxic functions for the wellbeing of dopaminergic neurons. The revised information provides significant evidence that allows astrocytes to be positioned as crucial players in PD etiology, a factor that needs to be taken into account when considering therapeutic targets for the treatment of the disease.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of symptoms associated with Parkinson's and their impact on functioning have led to an increased interest in exploring factors that impact Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). Although the experience of Parkinson's is unique, some symptoms have a greater impact than others, e.g. depression. Moreover, as the risk of Parkinson's increases with age, the financial and public health impact of this condition is likely to increase, particularly within the\u00a0context of a globally\u00a0ageing population. In Ireland, research is ongoing in the pursuit of causes and effective treatments for Parkinson's; however, its impact on everyday living, functioning, and HRQoL is largely under-examined. This study aims to describe factors that influence HRQoL for people with Parkinson's (PwP) in one region of Ireland.\nA cross-sectional postal survey was conducted among people living with Parkinson's (n\u2009=\u2009208) in one area\u00a0of Ireland. This survey included socio-demographic questions, Nonmotor Symptoms Questionnaire for Parkinson's disease (NMSQuest), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), and the Parkinson's disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). Statistical analysis was\u00a0conducted using SPSS, IBM version 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, II, USA).\nParticipants reflected a predominantly older population who were married, and lived in their own homes (91%). Participants diagnosed the longest reported poorer HRQoL regarding mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, social support, cognition, communication domains and overall HRQoL. Lower HRQoL correlated with higher depression scores p\u2009<\u20090.001 and participants in the lower HRQoL cohort experienced 2.25 times more non-motor symptoms (NMSs) than participants with higher HRQoL. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis predicted Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS15) score, NMS burden, and years since diagnosis to negatively impact HRQoL. Principal component analysis (PCA) also indicated that for the population in this study, components measuring 1) independence/dependence 2) stigma 3) emotional well-being, and 4) pain were central to explaining core aspects of participants' HRQoL.\nFindings highlighted the negative impact of longer disease duration, NMS burden, depression, mobility impairments, and perceived dependence on HRQoL for PwP. The positive influence of perceived independence, social engagement along with close supportive relationships were also identified as key components determining HRQoL. Findings emphasised the importance of long-term healthcare commitment to sustaining social and community supports and therapeutic, rehabilitative initiatives to augment HRQoL for PwP.",

    "abstract": "Axial\u00a0postural abnormalities and pain are two main determinants of poor quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Indeed, a detailed characterization of pain and other non-motor symptoms in patients with PAs has not been provided yet. The aim of this study is to assess the phenomenology of pain and other non-motor symptoms in PD patients with Pisa syndrome and camptocormia compared to PD patients without\u00a0axial postural abnormality. Forty-five PD participants were equally distributed in three groups: patients with Pisa syndrome (PS), patients with Camptocormia (CC), and patients without postural abnormalities (PD). Pain characteristics were assessed by Kings Parkinson's Pain Scale (KPPS), brief pain inventory (BPI), and numeric pain rating scale (NRS). All participants completed clinical assessments by non-motor symptom scale (NMSS), and movement disorder society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) parts II-III. Patients with and without axial\u00a0postural abnormalities showed one or more types of pain, being fluctuation, nocturnal, chronic, and musculoskeletal the most frequently reported in Pisa Syndrome and camptocormia. PD group compared with PS and CC groups showed differences in the KPPS, NMSS, BPI pain severity and interference, and NRS total scores. No significant differences were found between PS group compared with CC group with exception of the NMSS total scores. PD patients with Pisa syndrome or camptocormia have a higher burden of musculoskeletal, chronic and fluctuation pain than PD patients without axial\u00a0postural abnormalities, suggesting different etiologies of pain and possible different treatments.",

    "abstract": "Although striatal delivery of three critical genes for dopamine synthesis by viruses is a potential clinical approach for treating Parkinson's disease (PD), the approach makes it difficult to finely control dopamine secretion amounts and brings safety concerns. Here, we generate genetically engineered mesenchymal stem cells encoding three critical genes for dopamine synthesis (DOPA-MSCs). DOPA-MSCs retain their MSC identity and stable ability to secrete dopamine during passaging. Following transplantation, DOPA-MSCs reinstate striatal dopamine levels and correct motor function in PD rats. Importantly, after grafting into the caudate and putamen, DOPA-MSCs provide homotopic reconstruction of midbrain dopamine pathways by restoring striatal dopamine levels, and safely and long-term (up to 51 months) correct motor disorders and nonmotor deficits in acute and chronic PD rhesus monkey models of PD even with advanced PD symptoms. The long-term benefits and safety results support the idea that the development of dopamine-synthesized engineered cell transplantation is an important strategy for treating PD.",

    "abstract": "Dual-task training is an emerging field used for people with Parkinson disease (PD) to improve their physical and cognitive well-being, but the patients' acceptability, safety, and adherence to such training in online settings are unknown.\nThis study aims to evaluate the acceptability of a dual-task cognitive and motor online training program for people with PD as a group online community program.\nPeople with PD were invited to participate in an online program (PD3 Move) consisting of physical and vocal exercises in response to different cognitive challenges displayed as dynamic backgrounds on Zoom. The program ran twice per week for 16 weeks. Patient acceptability was assessed at 4 months by monitoring attendance rates and feedback from an exit questionnaire emailed to all participants assessing satisfaction, perceived benefit, safety, and willingness to continue and recommend to others.\nThe online program was delivered to 15 participants (n=9, 60%, females) with a diagnosis of PD, a mean age of 69.4 (SD 9.3) years, and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stages I-IV. The attendance rate was high, with participants coming to more than 13 (81%) of the sessions. Participants were very satisfied (n=8, 53%) or satisfied (n=7, 47%) with the program. Participants reported that what they most liked were the new cognitive physical challenges. The 3 main facilitators to participating were perceiving the benefits, instructor's flexibility and engagement, and the social interaction moments with others. The 3 main difficulties were dealing with motor fluctuations (n=3, 20%), difficulties in using technology (n=2, 13%), and difficulty hearing instructions due to hearing loss (n=2, 13%). Patients had favorable perceived benefits of the program, with 14 (93%) considering it very useful for the current management of health and 1 (7%) moderately useful. No adverse events were reported, and all participants said that they were willing to continue the program and recommend it to others.\nOur findings suggest that the online cognitive and motor program was well received, safe, and perceived to be of benefit to this group of medically stable people with PD in H&Y stages I-IV. Access to specialized care and enhancement of long-term adherence to regular exercise can be achieved with online community group programs.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular ATP can be a danger signal, but its role in striatal circuits afflicted in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unclear and was now investigated. ATP was particularly released at high stimulation intensities from purified striatal nerve terminals of mice, which were endowed with different ATP-P2 receptors (P2R), although P2R antagonists did not alter corticostriatal transmission or plasticity. Instead, ATP was extracellularly catabolized into adenosine through CD73 to activate adenosine A",

    "abstract": "So far, mutations in genes encoding lysosomal enzymes have been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by alpha-galactosidase A (\u03b1-GAL) deficiency, leading to deposition of globotriaosylceramide in the nervous system and other organs. We aimed to screen for FD a case series of PD patients from Southern Italy and to review the literature.\nOne hundred and forty-four consecutive unrelated PD subjects were enrolled. The \u03b1-GAL activity was measured in all men and, in case of pathological values, subsequent determination of globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) and GLA gene sequencing were also performed. All the women underwent GLA gene sequencing.\n\u03b1-GAL levels resulted low in fifteen men, whereas lyso-Gb3 testing showed values within the reference range in all of them. GLA gene variants were not detected in any tested subjects. One pathological study, six case series, and five case reports are currently reported in literature.\nThe few studies reviewed are heterogeneous, and the results are controversial. An unknown significance variant in GLA gene was detected in PD patients in one large study, whereas decreased \u03b1-GAL activity was observed in PD subjects in two other researches, but without confirmation by lyso-Gb3 assessment or genetic analysis. Vascular parkinsonism was associated to FD in five case reports. We found no association between PD and FD in our population. However, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions due to limited sample size. Furthermore, controls would have been missing in case of a positive finding.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate how cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) burden and its imaging markers are related to alterations in different gait parameters in Parkinson's disease (PD) and whether they affect attention, information processing speed, and executive function when global mental status is relatively intact.\nSixty-five PD patients were divided into the low CSVD burden group (n\u2009=\u200943) and the high CSVD burden group (n\u2009=\u200922). All patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging scans, clinical scale evaluations, and neuropsychological tests, as well as quantitative evaluation of gait and postural control. Multivariable linear regression models were conducted to investigate associations between CSVD burden and PD symptoms.\nBetween-group analysis showed that the high CSVD group had worse attention, executive dysfunction, information processing speed, gait, balance, and postural control than the low CSVD group. Regression analysis revealed that greater CSVD burden was associated with poor attention, impaired executive function, and slow gait speed; white matter hyperintensity was associated with slow gait speed, decreased cadence, increased stride time, and increased stance phase time; the presence of lacune was associated only with poor attention and impaired executive function; enlarged perivascular space in the basal ganglia was associated with gait speed.\nCSVD burden may worsen gait, postural control, attention, and executive function in patients with PD, and different imaging markers play different roles. Early management of vascular risks and treatment of vascular diseases provide an alternate way to mitigate some motor and cognitive dysfunction in PD.",

    "abstract": "(1) Background: Directed functional connectivity (DFC) alterations within brain networks are described using fMRI. EEG has been scarcely used. We aimed to explore changes in DFC in the sensory-motor network (SMN), ventral-attention network (VAN), dorsal-attention network (DAN), and central-executive network (CEN) using an EEG-based mapping between PD patients and healthy controls (HCs). (2) Methods: Four-minutes resting EEG was recorded from 29 PD patients and 28 HCs. Network\u2019s hubs were defined using fMRI-based binary masks and their electrical activity was calculated using the LORETA. DFC between each network\u2019s hub-pairs was calculated for theta, alpha and beta bands using temporal partial directed coherence (tPDC). (3) Results: tPDCs percent was lower in the CEN and DAN in PD patients compared to HCs, while no differences were observed in the SMN and VAN (group*network: F = 5.943, p < 0.001) in all bands (group*band: F = 0.914, p = 0.401). However, in the VAN, PD patients showed greater tPDCs strength compared to HCs (p < 0.001). (4) Conclusions: Our results demonstrated reduced connectivity in the CEN and DAN, and increased connectivity in the VAN in PD patients. These results indicate a complex pattern of DFC alteration within major brain networks, reflecting the co-occurrence of impairment and compensatory mechanisms processes taking place in PD.",

    "abstract": "The majority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) develop oropharyngeal dysphagia during the course of their disease. However, the efficacy of dysphagia treatments for these patients remains controversial. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate treatment efficacy based on the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\nFive electronic databases were systematically searched from inception date to April 2022. Two reviewers independently extracted and analyzed the data. The outcome measures were changes in swallowing-related characteristics based on instrumental swallowing assessments.\nAn initial search identified 187 RCT studies of relevance. After screening, nine studies with a total sample size of 286 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled effect size for all dysphagia treatments compared with control comparators was significant and medium (SMD [95% CI]\u00a0=\u00a00.58 [0.22, 0.94], p\u00a0=\u00a00.001; I\nOur results showed that overall, dysphagia treatments, particularly stimulation treatments, can potentially benefit PD patients. However, given the limited number of small RCTs for each type of treatment, the evidence remains weak and uncertain. Further large-scale, multicenter RCTs are warranted to fully explore their clinical efficacy in the PD population.",

    "abstract": "Deemed one of the most problematic neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly population, Parkinson's disease remains incurable to date. Ongoing diagnostic studies, however, have revealed that a large number of small molecule drugs that trigger the BMP2-Smad signaling pathway with an osteogenic nature may be effective in Parkinson's disease treatment. Although BMP2 and Smad1, 3, and 5 biomolecules promote neurite outgrowth and neuroprotection in dopaminergic cells as well, small molecules are quicker at crossing the BBB and reaching the damaged dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra due to a molecular weight less than 500\u2009Da. It is worth noting that osteogenic small molecules that inhibit Smurf1 phosphorylation do not offer therapeutic opportunities for Parkinson's disease; whereas, osteogenic small molecules that trigger Smad1, 3, and 5 phosphorylation may have strong therapeutic implications in Parkinson's disease by increasing the survival rate of dopaminergic cells and neuritogenesis. Notably, from a different perspective, it might be said that osteogenic small molecules can possibly put forth therapeutic options for Parkinson's disease by improving neuritogenesis and cell survival.",

    "abstract": "To identify the genetic linkage mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease (PD) and periodontitis, and explore the role of immunology in the crosstalk between both these diseases.\nThe gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets associated with whole blood tissue of PD patients and gingival tissue of periodontitis patients were obtained. Then, differential expression analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) deregulated in both diseases, which were defined as crosstalk genes. Inflammatory response-related genes (IRRGs) were downloaded from the MSigDB database and used for dividing case samples of both diseases into different clusters using k-means cluster analysis. Feature selection was performed using the LASSO model. Thus, the hub crosstalk genes were identified. Next, the crosstalk IRRGs were selected and Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was applied to investigate the correlation between hub crosstalk genes and hub IRRGs. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis was performed to examine the enrichment of immune cells in both diseases. The correlation between hub crosstalk genes and highly enriched immune cells was also investigated.\nOverall, 37 crosstalk genes were found to be overlapping between the PD-associated DEGs and periodontitis-associated DEGs. Using clustering analysis, the most optimal clustering effects were obtained for periodontitis and PD when k\u2009=\u20092 and k\u2009=\u20093, respectively. Using the LASSO feature selection, five hub crosstalk genes, namely, FMNL1, MANSC1, PLAUR, RNASE6, and TCIRG1, were identified. In periodontitis, MANSC1 was negatively correlated and the other four hub crosstalk genes (FMNL1, PLAUR, RNASE6, and TCIRG1) were positively correlated with five hub IRRGs, namely, AQP9, C5AR1, CD14, CSF3R, and PLAUR. In PD, all five hub crosstalk genes were positively correlated with all five hub IRRGs. Additionally, RNASE6 was highly correlated with myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in periodontitis, and MANSC1 was highly correlated with plasmacytoid dendritic cells in PD.\nFive genes (i.e., FMNL1, MANSC1, PLAUR, RNASE6, and TCIRG1) were identified as crosstalk biomarkers linking PD and periodontitis. The significant correlation between these crosstalk genes and immune cells strongly suggests the involvement of immunology in linking both diseases.",

    "results": "Overall, 37 crosstalk genes were found to be overlapping between the PD-associated DEGs and periodontitis-associated DEGs. Using clustering analysis, the most optimal clustering effects were obtained for periodontitis and PD when k\u2009=\u20092 and k\u2009=\u20093, respectively. Using the LASSO feature selection, five hub crosstalk genes, namely, FMNL1, MANSC1, PLAUR, RNASE6, and TCIRG1, were identified. In periodontitis, MANSC1 was negatively correlated and the other four hub crosstalk genes (FMNL1, PLAUR, RNASE6, and TCIRG1) were positively correlated with five hub IRRGs, namely, AQP9, C5AR1, CD14, CSF3R, and PLAUR. In PD, all five hub crosstalk genes were positively correlated with all five hub IRRGs. Additionally, RNASE6 was highly correlated with myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in periodontitis, and MANSC1 was highly correlated with plasmacytoid dendritic cells in PD.",

    "abstract": "Misfolded \u03b1-synuclein oligomers are closely implicated in the pathology of Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. The elusive nature of these aberrant assemblies makes it challenging to develop quantitative methods to detect them and modify their behavior. Existing detection methods use antibodies to bind \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in biofluids, although it remains challenging to raise antibodies against \u03b1-synuclein oligomers. To address this problem, we used an antibody scanning approach in which we designed a panel of 9 single-domain epitope-specific antibodies against \u03b1-synuclein. We screened these antibodies for their ability to inhibit the aggregation process of \u03b1-synuclein, finding that they affected the generation of \u03b1-synuclein oligomers to different extents. We then used these antibodies to investigate the size distribution and morphology of soluble \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from Parkinson's disease patients. Our results indicate that the approach that we present offers a promising route for the development of antibodies to characterize soluble \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in biofluids.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation mediated by microglia plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), and our previous studies showed this was significantly inhibited by enhanced autophagy. In the autophagy pathway, Bcl2-associated athanogene (BAG)3 is a prominent co-chaperone, and we have shown BAG3 can regulate autophagy to clear the PD pathogenic protein \u03b1-synuclein. However, the connection between BAG3 and microglia mediated neuroinflammation is not clear.\nIn this study, we explored whether BAG3 regulated related neuroinflammation and its original mechanism in PD. An inflammatory model of PD was established by injecting adeno-associated virus (AAV)-BAG3 into the bilateral striatum of C57BL/6 male mice to induce overexpression of BAG3, followed by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The striatum was extracted at 3 days after injection of LPS for Western blotting and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and immunohistochemical staining was performed at 21 days after injection. At the same time, LPS was used to induce activation of BV2 cells to verify the effect of BAG3 \nOverexpression of BAG3 reduced LPS-induced pyroptosis by reducing activation of caspase-1, the NOD-like receptor family, and the pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, and by release of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. The LPS-induced inflammatory environment inhibits autophagy, and overexpression of BAG3 can restore autophagy, which may be the mechanism by which BAG3 reduces neuronal inflammation in PD.\nOur results demonstrate BAG3 promotes autophagy and suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome formation in PD.",

    "abstract": "Gut dysbiosis contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Gastrointestinal disturbances in PD patients, along with gut leakage and intestinal inflammation, take place long before motor disorders. However, it remains unknown what bacterial species in gut microbiomes play the key role in driving PD pathogenesis. Here we show that Helicobacter hepaticus (H. hepaticus), abundant in gut microbiota from rotenone-treated human \u03b1-Synuclein gene (SNCA) transgenic mice and PD patients, initiates \u03b1-Synuclein pathology and motor deficits in an AEP-dependent manner in SNCA mice. Chronic Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment, an inflammatory inducer in the gut, activates AEP (asparagine endopeptidase) that cleaves \u03b1-Synuclein N103 and triggers its aggregation, promoting inflammation in the gut and the brain and motor defects in SNCA mice. PD fecal microbiota transplant or live H. hepaticus administration into antibiotics cocktail (Abx)-pretreated SNCA mice induces \u03b1-Synuclein pathology, inflammation in the gut and brain, and motor dysfunctions, for which AEP is indispensable. Hence, Helicobacter hepaticus enriched in PD gut microbiomes may facilitate \u03b1-Synuclein pathologies and motor impairments via activating AEP.",

    "abstract": "The brain glymphatic system is involved in the clearance of misfolding \u03b1-synuclein, the impaired glymphatic system may contribute to the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to analyze the diffusion tensor image along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) and perivascular space (PVS) burden to reveal the relationship between the glymphatic system and PD. A cross-sectional study using a 7\u2009T MRI of 76 PD patients and 48 controls was performed to evaluate the brain's glymphatic system. The DTI-ALPS and PVS burden in basal ganglia were calculated. Correlation analyses were conducted between DTI-ALPS, PVS burden and clinical features. We detected lower DTI-ALPS in the PD subgroup relative to controls, and the differences were more pronounced in patients with Hoehn & Yahr stage greater than two. The decreased DTI-ALPS was only evident in the left hemisphere in patients in the early stage but involved both hemispheres in more advanced PD patients. Decreased DTI-ALPS were also correlated with longer disease duration, higher Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score (UPDRS III) and UPDRS total scores, as well as higher levodopa equivalent daily dose. Moreover, the decreased DTI-ALPS correlated with increased PVS burden, and both indexes correlated with PD disease severity. This study demonstrated decreased DTI-ALPS in PD, which might initiate from the left hemisphere and progressively involve right hemisphere with the disease progression. Decreased DTI-ALPS index correlated with increased PVS burden, indicating that both metrics could provide supporting evidence of an impaired glymphatic system. MRI evaluation of the PVS burden and diffusion along PVS are potential imaging biomarkers for PD for disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a frequent disabling feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is treatable and may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment.\nWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the relationship between OH with PD-associated minimal cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) and assess the mitigating effects of potential confounding factors.\nObservational studies published in English, Spanish, French, or Portuguese up to January 2022 were searched for in PubMed, EBSCO, and SciELO databases. The primary aim of this study was to revise the association between OH with PD-MCI and PDD. Alongside, we assessed OH as related to cognitive rating scales. Fixed and random models were fitted. Meta-regression was used to assess the mitigating effects of confounding variables.\nWe identified 18 studies that reported OH association with PDD or PD-MCI, 15 of them reporting OH association with cognitive rating scales. OH was significantly associated with PDD/PD-MCI (OR, 95% CI: 3.31, 2.16-5.08; k\u2009=\u200918, n\u2009=\u20092251; p\u2009<\u20090.01). OH association with PDD (4.64, 2.68-8.02; k\u2009=\u200913, n\u2009=\u20091194; p\u2009<\u20090.01) was stronger than with PD-MCI (1.82, 0.92-3.58; k\u2009=\u20095, n\u2009=\u20091056; p\u2009=\u2009NS). The association between OH and PD-MCI/PDD was stronger in studies with a higher proportion of women and in those with a lower frequency of supine hypertension. Global cognition rating scale scores were lower in patients with OH (SMD, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20090.55,\u2009-\u20090.83/\u2009-\u20090.26; k\u2009=\u200912, n\u2009=\u20091427; p\u2009<\u20090.01).\nOrthostatic hypotension shows as a significant risk factor for cognitive impairment in PD, especially in women and patients not suffering from hypertension.",

    "abstract": "In advanced Parkinson's disease, oral medication can often no longer achieve sufficient therapeutic success. As one of the device aided therapies, the intrajejunal levodopa administration has been established as valuable treatment option. A modern form of the well-known intestinal levodopa pump offers the opportunity to continue the oral triple combination of levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone that many patients already use. Since February 2021 this modern option is available in Austria and Germany which also contains entacapone, whereby levodopa can be saved. In many other countries, including Hungary, approval is expected in the near future. The pump and cartridge are significantly smaller and lighter than in the LCIG pump which should improve the acceptance of the therapy. The higher acceptance of the smaller pump and the improved user-friendliness has already been reported in an observational study from Sweden. The unwanted effects of entacapone have to be considered.\nEl\u0151rehaladott Parkinson-k\u00f3rban a sz\u00e1jon \u00e1t adhat\u00f3 gy\u00f3gyszeres kezel\u00e9s gyakran nem \u00e9ri el a kell\u0151 ter\u00e1pi\u00e1s hat\u00e1st.

    "abstract": "Implementation of palliative care (PC) in neurology settings may improve symptom control and quality of life and reduce acute care admissions. The benefits of team-based PC for patients with Parkinson disease have been established through rigorous evidence standards including randomized controlled trials. However, evidence on implementation costs and return on investment (ROI) is unknown and may guide other providers and systems considering this model of care. We applied time-driven activity-based costing with reimbursable visits calculated using Medicare reimbursement rates in Colorado and current procedural technology codes to 2 outpatient clinics at the University of Colorado Hospital: neurology PC and movement disorders. Per-patient ROI was calculated as the ratio of the incremental difference in financial revenues divided by the incremental difference in investment to expand PC services. The cost per new patient was $154 and $98 for neuropalliative and movement disorders clinics, respectively. Established patient visit costs were $82 and $41 for the neuropalliative care and movement disorders clinics, respectively. The neurology PC clinic had per-patient revenue for new and established visits of $297 and $147, respectively, compared with $203 and $141 for new and established visits, respectively, at the comparator clinic. Based on our assumptions, for every $1 invested in expanding PC services, a projected $1.68 will be recouped by the hospital system for new patient visits, and $0.13 will be recouped for established patient visits. These amounts are context dependent, and a calculator was created to allow other systems to estimate costs and ROI. Our results suggest that in an academic medical setting, both neurology PC and movement disorders clinics provided increased revenue to the health system. Opportunities to improve ROI include efficient allocation of personnel to new and established visits, expanding telemedicine, and other cost offsets for complex patients not estimated in this analysis. ROI may also be greater in health systems that benefit from cost savings such as accountable care organizations. Our approach may be applied to other novel care models. Future research efforts will focus on estimating the continued sustainability of this innovative outpatient care model.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative movement disorders are rising in prevalence and are associated with high health care utilization. Generally, health care resources are disproportionately expended in the last year of life. Health care utilization by those with neurodegenerative movement disorders in the last year of life is not well-understood. The goal of this study was to assess the utilization of acute care in the last year of life among individuals with neurodegenerative movement disorders and determine whether outpatient neurology or palliative care affected acute care utilization and place of death.\nWe conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study including health system administrative data in Alberta, Canada, from 2011 to 2017. Administrative data were used to determine place of death and quantify emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and outpatient generalist and specialist visits. Diagnoses were classified by 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases codes. Stata 16v was used for statistical analyses.\nAmong 1439 individuals (60% male), Parkinson disease (n = 1226), progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 78), multiple system atrophy (n = 47), and Huntington disease (n = 58) were the most common diagnoses. The most frequent place of death was in hospital (45.9%), followed by long-term care (36.3%), home (7.9%), and residential hospice (4.0%). Most (64.2%) had >1 ED visit, and 14.4% had >3 emergency department visits. Fifty-five percent had >1 hospitalization, and 23.3% spent >30 days in hospital. Few (2.6%) were admitted to ICU. Only 37.2% and 8.8% accessed outpatient neurologist and specialist palliative care services, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression found the odds of dying at home was higher for those who received outpatient palliative consultation (OR, 2.49, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-4.21, \nThere are high rates of in-hospital death and acute care utilization in the year before death among those with neurodegenerative movement disorders. Most did not access specialist palliative or neurologic care in the last year of life. Outpatient palliative care and home care services were associated with increased odds of dying at home. Our results indicate the need for further research into the causes, costs, and potential modifiers to inform public health planning.",

    "abstract": "As the world's population ages, the incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurological ailment, keeps increasing. It is estimated that 1% of the global population over the age of 60 has the disease. The continuous loss of dopaminergic neurons and the concomitant brain depletion of dopamine levels represent the hallmarks of PD. As a result, current PD therapies primarily target dopamine or its precursor (levodopa). Therapeutic approaches that aim to provide an exogenous source of levodopa or dopamine are hindered by their poor bioavailability and the blood-brain barrier. Nevertheless, the fabrication of many polymeric nanoparticles has been exploited to deliver several drugs inside the brain. In addition to a brief introduction of PD and its current therapeutic approaches, this review covers novel polymeric nanoparticulate drug delivery systems exploited lately for dopamine and levodopa replacement in PD.",

    "abstract": "The second common disease that is neurodegenerative is connected with PD in elderly patients which is the distribution of gender. The proliferation has been reported in the last decade in homocysteine (Hcy) along with other diseases, epilepsy, Alzheimer, and idiopathic Parkinson's. Objectives - identifying the elevated level of Hcy which is a common factor for developmental disease and making the increase in motor disability of Hcy. With Parkinson's disease, a total of 70 patients were included in the case-control research which indicates that the newly diagnosed patients are not receiving any treatment at the department of neurology. These patients were compared with 70 healthy individuals attending the hospital for routine checkups matched for age and sex who were considered the control group. measurements of serum Hcy levels were done in both the case and control groups by the ELIZA method. This study shows that The mean Hcy level among the Parkinson's bunch was (16.884 \u00b1 15.582) which is essentially higher than that of the control bunch (9.493 \u00b1 3.752) at p=0.000 and albeit The Hcy level is higher in the currently analyzed patients (14.895\u00b19.073) contrasted and recently analyzed patients (17.640\u00b117.453) this distinction is genuinely non-critical Hcy level has a moderate direct relationship with the importance of brain highlights of the illness (r=0.682) in a genuinely huge way (p=0.000) While the connection with the term is exceptionally powerless (r=0.198) and measurably non-critical. Parkinson's patients have raised degrees of Hcy contrasted with ordinary individuals and there is an immediate relationship between the Hcy level and the importance of brain highlights of the sickness despite the fact that the Hcy level expanded with the span of the illness this shows a non-critical connection with sickness importance.",

    "abstract": "Poor walking endurance in Parkinson disease (PD) may be attributable to both bioenergetic and biomechanical factors, but locomotor training methods addressing both these factors simultaneously are understudied. Our objective was to examine the effects of overground locomotor training (OLT) on walking endurance in individuals with mild-to-moderate PD, and to further explore potential cardiorespiratory contributions.\nA single-arm, longitudinal design was used to examine the effects of 24 biweekly sessions of OLT in people with mild-to-moderate PD (n = 12). Walking endurance was measured as total distance walked during a 10-minute walk test (10minWT). Oxygen uptake (V\u02d9 o2 ) on-kinetic profiles were determined using a monoexponential function. Perceived fatigability was assessed following the 10minWT using a self-report scale. Magnitude of change in primary outcomes was assessed using Cohen's d and adjusted for sample size (Cohen's d(unbiased) ).\nParticipants executed 3036 (297) steps and maintained 65.5% (8%) age-predicted heart rate maximum in a typical session lasting 56.9 (2.5) minutes. Medium effects in total distance walked-885.9 (157.2) versus 969.5 (140.9); Cohen's d(unbiased) = 0.54-and phase II time constant of the V\u02d9 o2 on-kinetic profile-33.7 (12.3) versus 25.9 (15.3); Cohen's d(unbiased) = 0.54-were observed alongside trivial effects for perceived fatigability-4.7 (1.4) versus 4.8 (1.5); Cohen's d(unbiased) = 0.11-following OLT.\nThese preliminary findings may demonstrate the potential for moderate-intensity OLT to improve walking endurance and enhance cardiorespiratory adjustments to walking activity in adults with mild-to-moderate PD.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A407 ).",

    "abstract": "Repaglinide, a meglitinide insulinotropic antidiabetic, was unraveled as a promising therapeutic agent for Huntington's disease by targeting the neuronal calcium sensor downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM). However, its mechanistic profile in Parkinson's disease (PD) especially its impact on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitophagy, and their interconnections is poorly elucidated. This study is the first to examine the neuroprotective potential of repaglinide in rotenone-induced PD in rats by exploring its effects on DREAM, BiP/ATF6/CHOP ER stress pathway, apoptosis, mitophagy/autophagy, oxidative stress, astrogliosis/microgliosis, and neuroinflammation. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups: groups 1 and 2 received the vehicle or repaglinide (0.5 mg/kg/day p.o). Groups 3 and 4 received rotenone (1.5 mg/kg/48 h s.c) for 21 days; meanwhile, group 4 additionally received repaglinide (0.5 mg/kg/day p.o) for 15 days starting from day 11. Interestingly, repaglinide lessened striatal ER stress and apoptosis as evidenced by reduced BiP/ATF6/CHOP and caspase-3 levels; however, it augmented striatal DREAM mRNA expression. Repaglinide triggered the expression of the mitophagy marker PINK1 and the autophagy protein beclin1 and alleviated striatal oxidative stress through escalating catalase activity. In addition, repaglinide halted astrocyte/microglial activation and neuroinflammation in the striatum as expressed by reducing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding adaptor protein 1 (Iba1) immunostaining and decreasing interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1\u03b2 levels. Repaglinide restored striatum morphological alterations, intact neuron count, and neurobehavioral motor performance in rats examined by an open field, grip strength, and footprint gait analysis. Conclusively, repaglinide modulates the DREAM-ER stress BiP/ATF6/CHOP cascade, increases mitophagy/autophagy, inhibits apoptosis, and lessens oxidative stress, astrocyte/microglial activation, and neuroinflammation in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the world, which seriously damages motor and balance ability. Dual-task training is discussed as an appropriate intervention. The aim of this review was to synthesize the existing research findings on the efficacy of dual-task training for people with Parkinson's disease.\nA systematic search on PubMed, CENTRAL, Embase, Web of Science, and PEDro, randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) of dual-task training for individuals with Parkinson's disease.\nArticles published until 1 November 2022 were included. Our search identified 7 RCTs with a total of 406 subjects. Review Manager 5.4 software was used for bias evaluation and to process the results of the outcome measures collected from the investigations.\nDual-task training was associated with significant improvement in most motor and balance outcomes including gait velocity (standard mean difference (SMD)\u2009=\u20090.62; 95% CI, 0.37-0.87; \nEvidence from meta-analyses suggests that dual-task training may improve motor and balance abilities in Parkinson's disease patients. Future research should focus on finding the most appropriate dual-task treatment model for patients with different degrees, in order to further improve the rehabilitation treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) affects the quality of life of patients. Postural instability and gait disturbance are associated with the severity and prognosis of PD. We investigated the association of depression with axial involvement in early-stage PD patients.\nThis study involved 95 PD patients unexposed to antiparkinsonian drugs. After a baseline assessment for depression, the subjects were divided into a depressed PD group and a nondepressed PD group. Analyses were conducted to identify an association of depression at baseline with the following outcome variables: the progression to Hoehn and Yahr scale (H-Y) stage 3, the occurrence of freezing of gait (FOG), levodopa-induced dyskinesia, and wearing-off. The follow-up period was 53.40 \u00b1 16.79 months from baseline.\nKaplan-Meier survival curves for H-Y stage 3 and FOG showed more prominent progression to H-Y stage 3 and occurrences of FOG in the depressed PD group than in the nondepressed PD group (log-rank p = 0.025 and 0.003, respectively). Depression in drug-na\u00efve, early-stage PD patients showed a significant association with the progression to H-Y stage 3 (hazard ratio = 2.55; 95% confidence interval = 1.32-4.93; p = 0.005), as analyzed by Cox regression analyses. In contrast, the occurrence of levodopa-induced dyskinesia and wearing-off did not differ between the two groups (log-rank p = 0.903 and 0.351, respectively).\nDepression in drug-na\u00efve, early-stage PD patients is associated with an earlier occurrence of postural instability. This suggests shared nondopaminergic pathogenic mechanisms and potentially enables the prediction of early development of postural instability.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disease affecting dopaminergic (DA) neurons, is characterized by decline of motor function and cognition. Dopaminergic cell loss is associated with accumulation of toxic alpha synuclein aggregates. As DA neuron death occurs late in the disease, therapeutics that block the spread of alpha synuclein may offer functional benefit and delay disease progression. To test this hypothesis, we generated antibodies to the C terminal region of synuclein with high nanomolar affinity and characterized them in in vitro and in vivo models of spread. Interestingly, we found that only antibodies with high affinity to the distal most portion of the C-terminus robustly reduced uptake of alpha synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF) and accumulation of phospho (S129) alpha synuclein in cell culture. Additionally, the antibody treatment blocked the spread of phospho (S129) alpha synuclein associated-pathology in a mouse model of synucleinopathy. Blockade of neuronal PFF uptake by different antibodies was more predictive of in vivo activity than their binding potency to monomeric or oligomeric forms of alpha synuclein. These data demonstrate that antibodies directed to the C-terminus of the alpha synuclein have differential effects on target engagement and efficacy. Furthermore, our data provides additional support for the development of alpha synuclein antibodies as a therapeutic strategy for PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) in the nigrostriatal pathway that is followed by severe neuroinflammatory response. PD etiology is still puzzling; however, the mitocentric view might explain the vast majority of molecular findings not only in the brain, but also at systemic level. While neuronal degeneration is tightly associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, the causal role between aSyn accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction still requires further investigation. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction can elicit an inflammatory response that may be transmitted locally but also in a long range through systemic circulation. Furthermore, mitochondrial-driven innate immune activation may involve the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides, of which aSyn poses as a good candidate. While there is still a need to clarify disease-elicited mechanisms and how aSyn has the ability to modulate mitochondrial and cellular dysfunction, recent studies provide insightful views on mitochondria-inflammation axis in PD etiology.",

    "abstract": "Few studies interrogated the involvement of cerebellum in modulating gait in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with postural instability and gait disorders (PD-PIGD). This study aimed at assessing cerebellar atrophy and activity alterations during functional MRI (fMRI) gait-simulating motor- and dual-tasks in PD-PIGD.\nTwenty-one PD-PIGD and 23 healthy controls underwent clinical assessment, structural MRI, and fMRI including a motor-task (foot anti-phase movements) and a dual-task (foot anti-phase movements while counting backwards by threes). Grey matter cerebellar volumes were assessed using SUIT atlas. FMRI activations were extracted from each cerebellar lobule, and we correlated cerebellar and basal ganglia activity.\nPD-PIGD patients had reduced volumes of cerebellar motor and non-motor areas relative to controls. During fMRI motor-task, patients showed greater activation of cognitive cerebellar areas (VI and Crus I-II) vs controls. During fMRI dual-task, PD-PIGD patients showed increased activity of cognitive areas (Crus II) and reduced activity of motor areas (I-IV). Cerebellar structural alterations correlated with increased fMRI activity of cerebellar cognitive areas and with lower executive-attentive performance. The increased activity of Crus I during the motor-task correlated with a better motor performance in PD-PIGD. Moreover, the increased activity of cerebellum correlated with a reduced activity of putamen.\nIn PD-PIGD, the increased activity of non-motor cerebellar areas during gait-simulating tasks may be a consequence of grey matter atrophy or an attempt to compensate the functional failure of cerebellar motor areas and basal ganglia. Cerebellar MRI metrics are useful to characterize brain correlates of motor and dual-task abilities in PD-PIGD patients.",

    "abstract": "The Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ) and the Movement Imagery Questionnaire-Revised Second Version (MIQ-RS) are measurement instruments that assess motor imagery vividness. The aim of this study was to examine the validity and reliability of the Spanish KVIQ and MIQ-RS in people with Parkinson disease (PD).\nA longitudinal descriptive study was conducted following the COSMIN standards. Thirty-five people with idiopathic PD were evaluated twice (7-15 days apart) with the Spanish KVIQ and MIQ-RS. Structural validity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), smallest detectable change (SDC), and criterion validity of the MIQ-RS and KVIQ long (KVIQ-20), short (KVIQ-10), and extended (KVIQ-34) versions and their subscales (if pertinent) were tested.\nFactor analysis was satisfactory for the MIQ-RS, KVIQ-20, and KVIQ-10, providing evidence of their 2-dimensional structure. Evidence of the structural validity of the KVIQ-34 was not confirmed and thus was analyzed as an overall score. Revelle's \u03c9 > 0.9 showed excellent internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was moderate (ICC = 0.58-0.75) and higher for all visual subscales. SEM and SDC were up to 14.39% and 39.89% of the scores, respectively. Criterion validity between questionnaires and subscales was strong (Spearman's r > 0.7).\nThe results provide evidence for the validity and reliability of the Spanish MIQ-RS, KVIQ-20, and KVIQ-10 to assess motor imagery vividness in people with PD, whereas the KVIQ-34 should only be interpreted as an overall score. Psychometric, procedural, and practical features of the questionnaires should be considered when applying into clinical practice.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A401).",

    "abstract": "Despite many pharmacological and surgical treatments addressing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, there are no approved treatments that slow disease progression. Genetic discoveries in the last 20 years have increased our understanding of the molecular contributors to Parkinson's pathophysiology, uncovered many druggable targets and pathways, and increased investment in treatments that might slow or stop the disease process. Longitudinal, observational studies are dissecting Parkinson's disease heterogeneity and illuminating the importance of molecularly defined subtypes more likely to respond to targeted interventions. Indeed, clinical and pathological differences seen within and across carriers of PD-associated gene mutations suggest the existence of greater biological complexity than previously appreciated and increase the likelihood that targeted interventions based on molecular characteristics will be beneficial. This article offers our current perspective on the promise and current challenges in subtype identification and precision medicine approaches in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Due to basal ganglia dysfunction, short step length is a common gait impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD), especially in a dual-task walking. Here, we use electroencephalography (EEG) functional connectivity to investigate neural mechanisms of a stride awareness strategy that could improve dual-task walking in PD. Eighteen individuals with PD who had mild gait impairment walked at self-paced speed while keeping two interlocking rings from touching each other. During the dual-task walking trial, the participants received or did not receive awareness instruction to take big steps. Gait parameters, ring-touching time, and EEG connectivity in the alpha and beta bands were analyzed. With stride awareness, individuals with PD exhibited greater gait velocity and step length, along with a significantly lower mean EEG connectivity strength in the beta band. The awareness-related changes in the EEG connectivity strength of the beta band positively correlated with the awareness-related changes in gait velocity, cadence, and step length, but negatively correlated with the awareness-related change in step-length variability. The smaller reduction in beta connectivity strength was associated with greater improvement in locomotion control with stride awareness. This study is the first to reveal that a stride awareness strategy modulates the beta band oscillatory network and is related to walking efficacy in individuals with PD in a dual-task condition.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) represent the second most common type of degenerative dementia in patients aged 65 years and older, leading to progressive cognitive dysfunction and impaired quality of life. This study aims to provide a consensus based on a systematic Brazilian literature review and a comprehensive international review concerning PDD and DLB. Moreover, we sought to report on and give recommendations about the best diagnostic approaches focusing on primary and secondary care. Based on the available data, we recommend clinicians to apply at least one brief global cognitive instrument to assess PDD, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination and preferably the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised. Validated instruments to accurately assess functional abilities in Brazilian PD patients are still incipient. Further studies should focus on biomarkers with Brazilian cohorts.\nA dem\u00eancia da doen\u00e7a de Parkinson (DDP) e a dem\u00eancia com corpos de Lewy (DCL) representam a segunda causa mais comum de dem\u00eancia neurodegenerativa em pessoas com mais de 65 anos, ocasionando progressivo decl\u00ednio cognitivo e comprometimento da qualidade de vida. O presente estudo tem como objetivo prover um consenso de especialistas sobre a DDP e DCL, baseado em revis\u00e3o sistem\u00e1tica da literatura brasileira e revis\u00e3o n\u00e3o-sistem\u00e1tica de literatura internacional. Ademais, tal estudo visa promover informa\u00e7\u00e3o e conceder recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es sobre abordagem diagn\u00f3stica, com foco nos n\u00edveis de aten\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria e secund\u00e1ria em sa\u00fade. Com base nos dados dispon\u00edveis, recomendamos que os profissionais realizem pelo menos um breve instrumento cognitivo global, como o Mini-Exame do Estado Mental, contudo de prefer\u00eancia optem pela Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o Cognitiva de Montreal e o Exame Cognitivo de Addenbrooke-Revisado. Observa-se uma car\u00eancia de instrumentos validados para a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o precisa das habilidades funcionais em pacientes brasileiros com DDP e DCL. Al\u00e9m disso, mais estudos focando em biomarcadores com coortes brasileiras tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is frequent among people living with Parkinson's disease: up to 40% of patients exhibit symptoms of mild cognitive impairment and 25% meet the criteria for dementia. Parkinson's Disease Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS) is one of the recommended scales by the Movement Disorders Society Task Force for level 1 screening of dementia. However, its psychometric properties have not been studied in the Colombian population.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 patients with Parkinson's disease diagnosed by a movement disorders neurologist. Patients were evaluated with PD-CRS and MoCA. Principal component analysis was conducted, and then confirmatory factor analysis was implemented through the maximum-likelihood method. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach \n62% were males. Their median age was 68 years (IQR 57-74) and the median disease duration was 4 years (IQR 2-9). 77% were classified in early stages (Hoehn and Yahr stage \u2264\u20092), while the MDS-UPDRS part III score was 25 (IQR 15.5-38). In the principal component factor analysis, the pattern matrix unveiled a mnesic and a non-mnesic domain. Confirmatory factor analysis showed similar explanatory capacity (\nPD-CRS has acceptable psychometric properties for the Colombian population and has significant correlation and agreement with a validated scale (MoCA).",

    "abstract": "Context Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and causes many clinical manifestations including bradykinesia, tremor, postural instability, and musculoskeletal stiffness. Neurodegeneration is commonly associated with oxidative stress. Oxidative stress has not been measured in PD in relation to the manual techniques used in Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT). Objective To investigate the effect of OMT on oxidative stress biomarkers in PD. Methods In this randomized non-blinded study, 32 PD subjects were separated by block randomization into counseling and OMT groups, receiving respective interventions twice a week for six weeks. The counseling arm received informative sessions while the OMT arm received a set treatment protocol. Biomarkers of oxidative stress, malondialdehyde (MDA), dityrosine (DT), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and 8-isoprostane were measured before and after the first session and at weeks three, six, and 10 (four weeks after conclusion of intervention). Results No significant changes were found in blood plasma levels of MDA, DT, 3-NT, or 8-OHdG during or after intervention compared to controls (p > 0.05). No significant changes were found in urine 8-OHdG or 8-isoprostane during or after intervention compared to controls (p > 0.05). Conclusion OMT used in this study did not significantly affect the chosen oxidative stress biomarkers, however many limitations of the study may have impeded possible findings.",

    "abstract": "Our ability to enact successful goal-directed actions involves multiple learning processes. Among these processes, implicit motor adaptation ensures that the sensorimotor system remains finely tuned in response to changes in the body and environment. Whether Parkinson's disease impacts implicit motor adaptation remains a contentious area of research: whereas multiple reports show impaired performance in this population, many others show intact performance. While there is a range of methodological differences across studies, one critical issue is that performance in many of the studies may reflect a combination of implicit adaptation and strategic re-aiming. Here, we revisited this controversy using a visuomotor task designed to isolate implicit adaptation. In two experiments, we found that adaptation in response to a wide range of visual perturbations was similar in Parkinson's disease and matched control participants. Moreover, in a meta-analysis of previously published and unpublished work, we found that the mean effect size contrasting Parkinson's disease and controls across 16 experiments involving over 200 participants was not significant. Together, these analyses indicate that implicit adaptation is preserved in Parkinson's disease, offering a fresh perspective on the role of the basal ganglia in sensorimotor learning.",

    "results": "A moderate agreement in the raters' classification of pathological and non-pathological scores emerged regarding early and late H/M ratio values (\u03ba = 0.45 and 0.69 respectively), applying the manual method, while the early and late H/M ratios obtained with the semi-automatic method reached a good agreement among observers (\u03ba = 0.78). Cohen-Kappa values revealed that the semi-automatic method improved the agreement between expert and inexpert raters: the agreement improved from a minimum of 0.29 (fair, for early H/M) and 0.69 (substantial, in late H/M) with the manual method, to 0.90 (perfect, in early H/M) and 0.87 (perfect, in late H/M) with the semi-automatic method.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common nervous system disease, mainly manifested as motor retardation, resting tremor, etc. (1). The clinical features of early PD patients are not characteristic, and diagnosis is very difficult. When obvious PD manifestations are found, the number of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra of patients has been reduced by more than half, and the treatment is difficult (2). Early diagnosis or auxiliary diagnosis of PD in clinical work is crucial for the treatment of PD and the prognosis of patients. In recent years, cerebral ultrasound has been widely used in the diagnosis and treatment of some diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, tuberculous meningitis, brain injury, etc., especially for the study of PD. The European Union of neuroscience and the latest diagnostic guidelines for PD in China have confirmed the role of the transcranial sonography (TCS). This article reviews the recent advances in the study of PD by transcranial sonography.",

    "abstract": "Yang-ge dancing is a culturally specific exercise in which people are required to perform motor skills in coordination with rhythmic music. As an integrated exercise with both physical (decelerating the progression of aged-related motor function degeneration) and mental benefits, it has gained great popularity in China, especially among middle-aged and older adults. It remains largely unknown whether Yang-ge dancing (YG) can effectively improve main symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), while conventional exercise rehabilitation program has been recommended in the hospital setting. To this end, this study aimed to investigate the comparative effects of exercise therapy on motor function of PD patients.\nA sample of 51 PD patients were randomly assigned to Yang-ge dancing, conventional exercise, or conventional exercise with music. Participants in each group performed 60 min per session, five sessions per week of interventions for 4 weeks. All the participants were assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-motor examination, Berg balance test, timed up and go test, and Purdue pegboard test. Motor performances were examined before and after intervention.\nAll the three groups were benefited from exercise. Compared to conventional exercise, the Yang-ge dancing and conventional exercise with music had additional positive effects in mobility with reference to baseline.In addition, compared to the two conventional exercise groups (either with/without music), the Yang-ge dancing further enhanced manual dexterity.\nExercise with rhythmic auditory stimulation optimized mobility in PD, while YG dance specifically contributed to improvement in manual dexterity.\n[https://clinicaltrials.gov/], identifier [ChiCTR2200061252].",

    "abstract": "In our previous study, repeated sessions of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the auditory feedback area were shown to improve hypokinetic dysarthria (HD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) and led to changes in functional connectivity within the left-sided articulatory networks. We analyzed data from this previous study and assessed the effects of rTMS for HD in PD on the diffusion parameters of the left anterior arcuate fasciculus (AAF), which connects the auditory feedback area with motor regions involved in articulation.\nPatients were assigned to 10 sessions of real or sham 1-Hz stimulation over the right posterior superior temporal gyrus. Stimulation effects were evaluated using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging and by a speech therapist using a validated tool (Phonetics score of the Dysarthric Profile) at baseline, immediately after 2\u2009weeks of stimulation, and at follow-up visits at Weeks 6 and 10 after the baseline.\nAltogether, data from 33 patients were analyzed. A linear mixed model revealed significant time-by-group interaction (p\u00a0=\u20090.006) for the relative changes of fractional anisotropy of the AAF; the value increases were associated with the temporal evolution of the Phonetics score (R\u00a0=\u20090.367, p\u00a0=\u20090.028) in the real stimulation group.\nReal rTMS treatment for HD in PD as compared to sham stimulation led to increases of white matter integrity of the auditory-motor loop during the 2-month follow-up period. The changes were related to motor speech improvements.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's disease (PD) are more likely to be hospitalized and initiate antidepressant use compared to people without PD. It is not known if hospitalization increases the risk of antidepressant initiation. We studied whether a\u00a0recent hospitalization associates with antidepressant initiation in people with PD.\nA nested case-control study within the nationwide register-based FINPARK cohort which includes community-dwelling Finnish residents diagnosed with PD between years 1996 and 2015 (N\u2009=\u200922,189) was conducted. Initiation of antidepressant use after PD diagnosis was identified from Prescription Register with 1-year washout period (cases). One matched non-initiator control for each case was identified (N\u2009=\u20095492 age, sex, and time since PD diagnosis-matched case-control pairs). Hospitalizations within the 14\u2009day-period preceding the antidepressant initiation were identified from the Care Register for Health Care.\nThe mean age at antidepressant initiation was 73.5\u2009years with median time since PD diagnosis 2.9\u2009years. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (48.1%) and mirtazapine (35.7%) were the most commonly initiated antidepressants. Recent hospitalization was more common among antidepressant initiators than non-initiators (48.3 and 14.3%, respectively) and was associated with antidepressant initiation also after adjusting for comorbidities and use of medications during the washout (adjusted OR, 95% CI 5.85, 5.20-6.59). The initiators also had longer hospitalizations than non-initiators. PD was the most common main discharge diagnosis among both initiators (54.6%) and non-initiators (28.8%). Discharge diagnoses of mental and behavioral disorders and dementia were more common among initiators.\nHospitalisation is an opportunity to identify and assess depressive symptoms, sleep disorders and pain, which may partially explain the association. Alternatively, the indication for antidepressant initiation may have led to hospitalisation, or hospitalisation to aggravation of, e.g., neuropsychiatric symptoms leading to antidepressant initiation.",

In this study, we used a template-based, automatic, SN subregion segmentation pipeline to detect the neuromelanin (NM) and iron features in the SN and SN pars compacta (SNpc) derived from a single 3D magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) gradient echo (GRE) sequence in an attempt to develop a comprehensive imaging biomarker that could be used to diagnose PD.\nA total of 100 PD patients and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were imaged on a 3T scanner. NM-based SN (SN\nIn this study, we verified the value of the fully automatic template based midbrain deep gray matter mapping approach in differentiating PD patients from HCs.

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammatory status produced via activation of toll like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and interleukin-17 receptor (IL-17R) is one of the principal mechanisms involved in dopaminergic neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease (PD). Activation of TLR-4 and IL-17R stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17, IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, IL-6) production that augments neurodegeneration and reduces neuro-survival axis (TrKB/Akt/CREB/BDNF). So, reducing IL-17-driven neuroinflammation via secukinumab, monoclonal antibody against IL-17A, may be one of therapeutic approach for PD. Moreover, the aim was extended to delineate the possible neuroprotective mechanism involved against neuronal loss in rotenone induced PD in rats. Rats received 11 subcutaneous injection of rotenone (1.5\u00a0mg/kg) every other day for 21 consecutive days and treated with 2 subcutaneous injections of secukinumab (15\u00a0mg/kg) on day 9 and 15, one hour after rotenone administration. Treatment with secukinumab improved motor impairment and muscle incoordination induced by rotenone, as verified by open field and rotarod tests. Moreover, secukinumab attenuated neuronal loss and improve histopathological profile. Noteworthy, secukinumab reduces neuro-inflammatory status by hindering the interaction between IL and 17A and IL-17RA together with inhibiting the activation of TLR-4 and its downstream cascade including pS536-NF\u03baB p65, IL-1\u03b2 and HMGB-1. Additionally, secukinumab stimulated neuro-survival signalling cascade via activation pY515-TrKB receptor and triggered upsurge in its downstream targets (pS473-Akt/pS133-CREB/BDNF). Furthermore, secukinumab increased striatal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoexpression, the rate limiting step in dopamine biosynthesis, to guard against dopaminergic neuronal loss. In conclusion, secukinumab exerts a neuroprotective effect against rotenone induced neuronal loss via inhibition IL17A/IL17RA interaction and HMGB-1/TLR-4/NF-\u03baBp65/IL1\u03b2 signalling cascade, together with activation of TrKB/ Akt/CREB/BDNF axis.",

    "abstract": "Clinical worsening has been common in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) during the social distancing due to pandemic. It is unclear if telerehabilitation applied during social distancing preserves clinical aspects of people with PD who are frequent exercisers before the pandemic. Thus, we compared the effects of 10\u00a0months of supervised, home-based, real-time videoconferencing telerehabilitation (SRTT) and nonexercising control on clinical aspects in people with PD who are frequent exercisers before the pandemic.\nFifty-seven (SRTT group) and 29 (nonexercising control group) people with PD were retrospectively assessed (Clinical Trials Registry: RBR-54sttfk). Only the SRTT group performed a 60-min online training sessions, 2-3\u00a0days per week, for 10\u00a0months (April 2020 to January 2021) during social distancing. Quality of life (PD Questionnaire [PDQ-39]), walking (item 28 from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III [UPDRS-III]), posture (item 29 from the UPDRS-III), and freezing of gait (New-FOG questionnaire [NFOGQ]) were retrospectively assessed before (February-March 2020) and during social distancing (February-March 2021). The assessments were performed in-person and remotely before and during social distancing, respectively.\nThere were no between-group differences at baseline (p\u2009>\u20090.05). SRTT preserves PDQ-39 and walking scores but not posture and NFOGQ scores, while nonexercising control worsens scores in all variables. In addition, SRTT is more effective than nonexercising control in preserving PDQ-39 and walking scores.\nDuring social distancing, long-term SRTT preserves the subjective quality of life and walking, but not subjective posture and FOG in people with PD who are frequent exercisers before the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "The clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by heterogeneity in age at onset, disease duration, rate of progression, and the constellation of motor versus non-motor features. There is an unmet need for the characterization of distinct disease subtypes as well as improved, individualized predictions of the disease course. We used unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods on comprehensive, longitudinal clinical data from the Parkinson's Disease Progression Marker Initiative (n\u2009=\u2009294 cases) to identify patient subtypes and to predict disease progression. The resulting models were validated in an independent, clinically well-characterized cohort from the Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (n\u2009=\u2009263 cases). Our analysis distinguished three distinct disease subtypes with highly predictable progression rates, corresponding to slow, moderate, and fast disease progression. We achieved highly accurate projections of disease progression 5\u2009years after initial diagnosis with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.95\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01) for the slower progressing group (PDvec1), 0.87\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 for moderate progressors, and 0.95\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 for the fast-progressing group (PDvec3). We identified serum neurofilament light as a significant indicator of fast disease progression among other key biomarkers of interest. We replicated these findings in an independent cohort, released the analytical code, and developed models in an open science manner. Our data-driven study provides insights to deconstruct PD heterogeneity. This approach could have immediate implications for clinical trials by improving the detection of significant clinical outcomes. We anticipate that machine learning models will improve patient counseling, clinical trial design, and ultimately individualized patient care.",

Medical records throughout the entire disease course of consecutive patients with neuropathology-confirmed PD and MSA from the Queen Square Brain Bank were systematically reviewed. Time of onset and severity of OH-related symptoms were documented, and their association with other clinical and neuropathologic variables was evaluated. Dementia risk for patients with PD and cognitive impairment risk for patients with MSA were estimated using multivariable hazard regression.\nOne hundred thirty-two patients with PD and 137 with MSA were included. Patients with MSA developed OH more frequently, earlier in the disease course and with more severe symptoms. Cumulative dementia prevalence was higher in patients with PD. Multivariable adjusted regression models showed that early OH, but not its symptom severity, increased dementia risk in patients with PD by 14% per year (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.93) and cognitive impairment risk in patients with MSA by 41% per year (HR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.42-0.83). Early OH was not associated with increased \u03b1-synuclein, \u03b2-amyloid, tau, Alzheimer, or cerebrovascular pathologies. No significant associations were found between severity of OH symptoms and other clinical or neuropathologic variables.\nEarly OH, but not its symptom severity, increases the risk of cognitive impairment in patients with PD and MSA. OH is not associated with more extensive Lewy, \u03b2-amyloid, tau, Alzheimer, or cerebrovascular pathologies. It is likely that OH contributes to cognitive impairment in patients with PD and MSA by hypoxia-induced nonspecific neurodegeneration. Further research should evaluate whether improving brain perfusion by treating OH may modify the risk of dementia in these conditions.",

    "abstract": "Pesticide exposure has consistently been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) onset. Yet, fewer epidemiologic studies have examined whether pesticides influence PD motor and non-motor symptom progression.\nUsing a geographic information system tool that integrates agricultural pesticide use reports and land use records to derive ambient exposures at residences and workplaces, we assessed associations between specific pesticides previously related to PD onset with PD symptom progression in two PD patient cohorts living in agricultural regions of California.\nWe calculated the pounds of pesticide applied agriculturally near each participant's residential or occupational addresses from 1974 to the year of PD diagnosis, using a geographic information system tool that links the California Pesticide Use Reports database to land use data. We examined 53 pesticides selected a priori as they have previously been associated with PD onset. We longitudinally followed two PD patient cohorts (PEG1 N = 242, PEG2 N = 259) for an average of 5.0 years (SD \u00b1 3.5) and 2.7 years (SD \u00b1 1.6) respectively and assessed PD symptoms using the movement disorder specialist-administered Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Weighted time-to-event regression models were implemented to estimate effects.\nTen agricultural pesticides, including copper sulfate (pentahydrate), 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) dimethylamine salt, tribufos, sodium cacodylate, methamidophos, ethephon, propargite, bromoxynil octanoate, monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA), and dicamba, were associated with faster symptom progression. Among these pesticides, residential or workplace proximity to higher amounts of copper sulfate (pentahydrate) and MCPA (dimethylamine salt) was associated with all three progression endpoints (copper sulfate: HRs = 1.22-1.36, 95 % CIs = 1.03-1.73; MCPA: HRs = 1.27-1.35, 95 % CIs = 1.02-1.70).\nOur findings suggest that pesticide exposure may not only be relevant for PD onset but also PD progression phenotypes. We have implicated ten specific pesticide active ingredients in faster PD motor and non-motor decline.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease associated psychosis (PDAP) is a prevalent non-motor symptom (NMS) that significantly erodes patients' and caregivers' quality of life yet remains vastly understudied. One potential source of PDAP in late-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) is the common dopamine (DA) replacement therapy for motor symptoms, Levodopa (L-DOPA). Given the high incidence of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in later phases of PD, this study sought to characterize the relationship between PDAP and LID in a bilateral medial forebrain bundle 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide (6-OHDA) lesion rat model. To assess PDAP in this model, prepulse inhibition (PPI), a well-validated assay of sensorimotor gating, was employed. First, we tested whether a bilateral lesion alone or after chronic L-DOPA treatment was sufficient to induce PPI dysfunction. Rats were also monitored for LID development, using the abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) test, to examine PPI and LID associations. In experiment 2, Vilazodone (VZD), a serotonin transporter (SERT) blocker and 1A receptor (5-HT",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. The main therapeutic approach available nowadays relieves motor symptoms but does not prevent or stop neurodegeneration. Rosmarinic acid (RA), an ester of caffeic and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acids, is obtained from numerous plant species such as Salvia officinalis L. (sage) and Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary). This compound has a wide spectrum of biological activities, such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, and could be an additional therapy for neurodegenerative disorders. Here we evaluated the potential neuroprotective effects of RA treatment in a murine model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Mice were separated into four groups: CN, Control/saline; RA, Rosmarinic acid/vehicle; MPTP, MPTP/saline; MPTP+RA, MPTP/RA. RA (20 mg/kg, or vehicle) was administered orally by intra-gastric gavage for 14 days, one hour before MPTP or saline injection. MPTP groups received the drug (30\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneally) once a day for five days (fourth to the eighth day of the experiment). MPTP-treated animals displayed hyperlocomotion behavior, which was significantly prevented by RA treatment. In addition, RA treatment increased dopaminergic signaling in the parkinsonian mice and improved the monoaminergic system in healthy animals. Analysis of alterations in the striatal mRNA expression of dopaminergic system components showed that MAO-A expression was increased in the MPTP+AR group. Overall, this study brings new evidence of the potential neuroprotective properties of RA not only in preventing behavioral features observed in PD, but also by improving neurotransmission in the healthy brain.",

As PD is rare, case finding remains a challenge, contributing to our limited understanding of PD risk factors. Here, we explore the validity of case-finding strategies and whether military employment is associated with PD.\nWe identified Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study participants reporting military employment as their longest or second longest occupation. We used self-report and prescription fills to identify PD cases and validated this case-finding approach against medical record review.\nAt enrollment, 6% of 5,125 eligible participants had military employment and 1.8% had prevalent PD; an additional 3.5% developed PD over follow-up (mean: 8.3\u00a0years). Sensitivity of our case-finding approach was higher for incident (80%) than prevalent cases (54%). Specificity was high (>97%) for both. Military employment was not associated with prevalent PD. Among nonsmokers, point estimates suggested an increased risk of incident PD with military employment, but the result was non-significant and based on a small number of cases.\nSelf-report and prescription medications can accurately identify incident PD cases relative to the reference method of medical record review. We found no association between military employment and PD.",

From a genetic point of view, PD is basically considered a sporadic, idiopathic disease, however, hereditary components can be detected in 5-10% of patients. Expanding data are available regarding the targeted molecular therapy of the disease.\nThe aim of this current review article is to provide brief clinical and molecular insight into three important genetic forms (LRRK2, SNCA, GBA) of hereditary PD subtypes and to present the human clinical trials in relation to these forms of the disease.\nThese small hereditary subgroups are crucially important in drug development, because the general trend is that clinical trials that treat PD patients as a large group, without any separation, do not meet expectations. As a result, no long term conclusions can currently be drawn regarding the effectiveness of the molecules tested in these phase 1 and 2 studies. Further precise studies are needed in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Microglia activation and neuroinflammation have been extensively studied in murine models of neurodegenerative diseases; however, to overcome the genetic differences between species, a human cell model of microglia able to recapitulate the activation profiles described in patients is needed. Here we developed human models of Parkinson's like neuroinflammation by using the human microglia clone 3 (HMC3) cells, whose activation profile in response to classic inflammatory stimuli has been controversial and reported only at mRNA levels so far. In fact, we showed the increased expression of the pro-inflammatory markers iNOS, Caspase 1, IL-1\u03b2, in response to IFN-\u03b3 plus high glucose, a non-specific disease stimulus that emphasized the dynamic polarization and heterogenicity of the microglial population. More specifically, we demonstrated the polarization of HMC3 cells through the upregulation of iNOS expression and nitrite production in response to the Parkinson's like stimuli, 6-hydroxidopamine (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), the latter depending on the NF-\u03baB pathway. Furthermore, we identified inflammatory mediators that promote the pro-inflammatory activation of human microglia as function of different pathways that can simulate the phenotypic transition according to the stage of the pathology. In conclusion, we established and characterized different systems of HMC3 cells activation as ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative condition diagnosed in North America. We recently demonstrated, using multiple epidemiological data sources, that the prevalence of PD diagnoses was greater than previously reported and currently used for clinical, research, and policy decision-making. Prior PD incidence estimates have varied, for unclear reasons. There is a need for improved estimates of PD incidence, not only for care delivery planning and future policy but also for increasing our understanding of disease risk. The objective of this study was thus to investigate the incidence of Parkinson disease across five epidemiological cohorts in North America in a common year, 2012. The cohorts contained data on 6.7 million person-years of adults ages 45 and older, and 9.3 million person-years of adults ages 65 and older. Our estimates of age-sex-adjusted incidence of PD ranged from 108 to 212 per 100,000 among persons ages 65 and older, and from 47 to 77 per 100,00 among persons ages 45 and older. PD incidence increased with age and was higher among males. We also found persistent spatial clustering of incident PD diagnoses in the U.S. PD incidence estimates varied across our data sources, in part due to case ascertainment and diagnosis methods, but also possibly due to the influence of population factors (prevalence of genetic risk factors or protective markers) and geographic location (exposure to environmental toxins). Understanding the source of these variations will be important for health care policy, research, and care planning.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder with motor and nonmotor symptoms. Recent studies demonstrate various susceptibility loci and candidate genes for familial forms of the disease. However, the genetic basis of the familial form of early-onset PD (EOPD) is not widely studied in the Iranian population. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the possible causative genetic variants responsible for developing EOPD among Iranian patients. Iranian patients with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease were evaluated, and 12 consanguineous families with at least two affected individuals with early-onset PD (EOPD) were chosen to enroll in the present study. An expert neurologist group examined these families. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on PD patients, and the possible causative genetic variants related to the development of PD were reported. Exome sequencing (WES) was performed on every PD patient and revealed that patients had novel genetic variants in PRKN, PARK7, and PINK1 genes. All the genetic variants were in homozygous status and none of these variants were previously reported in the literature. Moreover, these genetic variants were \"pathogenic\" based on bioinformatic studies and according to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). The present research revealed some novel variants for EOPD among the Iranian population. Further functional studies are warranted to confirm the pathogenicity of these novel variants and establish their clinical application for the early diagnosis of EOPD.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia and Parkinson's disease are closely related diseases of the elderly population leading to progressive disability and nursing-dependent care.\nThe aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of sarcopenia in PD patients with three different approaches: (1) the screening tool SARC-F, (2) EWGSOP-1 criteria, and (3) EWGSOP-2 criteria. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the screening tool SARC-F to detect sarcopenia according to the updated EWGSOP-2 criteria.\nEighty-one patients with Parkinson's disease aged 65 years and above were interviewed in a cross-sectional study at a tertiary referral center. All patients were screened with the SARC-F questionnaire and were evaluated for motor and non-motor symptoms, exercise, quality of life, and frailty. Muscle mass was assessed with bioelectrical impedance analysis, handgrip strength with a dynamometer, and gait speed was assessed with the 8-m walk test. EWGSOP-2 criteria were considered the gold standard to diagnose sarcopenia in our study.\nEighty-one patients were evaluated (mean age: 73.82; SD 5.30). The prevalence of sarcopenia was 28.4% according to the EWGSOP-2 criteria. The concordance between EWGSOP-2 and EWGSOP-1 was poor (weighted kappa of 0.361[95% 0.164-0.557]). The sensitivity of the SARC-F screening test for detecting sarcopenia was 60.9%. The corresponding AUC in the ROC curve analysis showed 0.598 (0.462, 0.734 CI). The item assessing strength was found to have the highest sensitivity (69.6%).\nSarcopenia prevalence in patients with PD in Tirol, Austria is higher with EWGSOP-1 criteria compared to EWGSOP-2 criteria. The sensitivity and specificity of the SARC-F scale to detect sarcopenia in this population are poor.",

    "abstract": "Pimavanserin is approved in the USA to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP).\nWe evaluated mortality in patients with PDP after initiation of pimavanserin or comparator atypical antipsychotics, overall, over time, and across subgroups.\nA cohort of patients aged \u226565\u00a0years in the USA with PDP newly initiating pimavanserin or a comparator atypical antipsychotic (clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole) was identified in 2016-2019 Medicare claims data. All-cause mortality in the propensity score-matched treatment groups was compared with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimated with Cox-proportional hazards models. Cumulative incidence curves and time period-specific models evaluated risk over time. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed, including a sub-cohort of long-term care (LTC) or skilled nursing facility (SNF) residents.\nWe identified 2892 pimavanserin initiators and 19,083 comparator initiators (overall 47% female, mean age\u00a0=\u00a080.9\u00a0years, LTC/SNF residents\u00a0=\u00a030%). Before matching, pimavanserin users had fewer severe comorbidities and more anti-Parkinson medication use than comparators. Matching resulted in 2891 patients in both groups, and all covariates were well balanced. In the matched cohort, the HR for mortality for pimavanserin versus comparator was 0.78 (95% CI 0.67-0.91), with the lowest time period-specific HRs in the first 180\u00a0days. Hazard ratios were similar across sensitivity analyses and subgroups. In LTC/SNF residents, the HR was 0.78 (95% CI 0.60-1.01).\nThe observed mortality rates were lower among patients treated with pimavanserin compared with those treated with other atypical antipsychotics.\nEuropean Union Post-authorization Study (EU PAS) register number 46331.",

    "abstract": "Neurotensin (NTS) is a 13-amino acid neuropeptide functionally linked with the brain dopaminergic system via expression of the NTS peptide or its receptor in dopamine neurons. Neuropeptide-binding immunoglobulins (Igs) are present in humans and can be involved in both physiological and pathological processes. Considering the functional link between NTS and dopamine neurons, we studied the occurrence of NTS-binding IgG autoantibodies in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nPlasma levels of NTS-binding IgG were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in both male and female PD patents and in age-matched healthy controls. Possible microbial origin of NTS cross-reactive IgG was analyzed by sequence alignment of the 6-amino acid C-terminal NTS pharmacophore with bacterial and viral proteins from the public NCBI database.\nNTS-binding IgG were detected in the plasma of all study subjects, while their levels were consistently lower in PD patients versus controls (p = 0.0001), independently from age or sex of the study participants. Moreover, PD patients with a more severe stage (2.5-3.0) of the disease had lower levels of NTS-binding IgG (p = 0.0004) than those with a milder stage (1.0-2.0). Furthermore, PD patients taking amantadine or high doses of levodopa had higher levels of NTS-binding IgG than those without medication. Contiguous sequence homology for the NTS pharmacophore was present in several microbial proteins occurring in human gut microbiota.\nThe study revealed that NTS-binding IgG occur naturally in humans and that PD patients display their low plasma levels accentuated by disease severity. The functional significance of this finding and its relevance to the pathophysiology of PD, including putative link to gut microbiota, remain to be studied.",

    "abstract": "In the absence of a disease-modifying treatment and prognostic uncertainty, ethics of risk disclosure in prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD) is challenging. Previous studies highlighted several facets of these challenges from the perspective of involved parties. However, to date, the view of neurologists who may encounter individuals with prodromal PD remained unrepresented. Moreover, cross-cultural differences intrinsic to the ethics of risk disclosure are yet to be elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the attitude of neurologists toward risk disclosure in prodromal PD.\nIn this observational study, Turkish neurologists were invited to fill out a questionnaire evaluating their stance on risk disclosure regarding an individual with polysomnography-confirmed REM sleep behavior disorder, which is the strongest risk factor for PD.\nMore than 90% of the participating 222 neurologists were familiar with prodromal PD. While 15.3% stated that the risk should be disclosed in any case, 6.8% chose no disclosure. The remaining 77.9% favored disclosure only under certain circumstances, the plurality of which was the individual's consent to know about the risk. After reminding the potential neuroprotective effects of exercise and diet, neurologists who chose the option of \"no disclosure\" decreased to 3.2% (McNemar's test p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). No significant differences among the neurologists were found regarding sex, academic title, or field of interest.\nThe majority of the neurologists found it appropriate to disclose the risk of future PD only if the individual expresses a desire to know. Also, recognition of the impact of lifestyle factors on PD is important in prognostic counseling.",

    "abstract": "Mirror writing (MW) is the production of individual letters, words, or word strings in the reverse direction. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and high MW rates have been reported in patients with PD. Thus, the present study sought to identify the factors that cause MW in patients with PD. We examined the frequency of MW in patients with PD and investigated the area of the brain where such frequency inversely correlates with reduced regional cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (rCMRglc). We also examined whether this area satisfied the motor and visual monitoring hypotheses of MW that have been presented in previous studies. Thirty-six subjects with idiopathic PD and 23 healthy controls were included in the study. We asked the participants to write down words, numerals, and sentences from left to right using their dominant and non-dominant hands. Patients with PD underwent an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan to measure the rCMRglc. Neither the patients with PD nor the healthy subjects exhibited MW in the use of the right hand. In the use of the left hand, MW occurred in 15 of the 36 patients with PD, but in none of the healthy controls. The right intraparietal sulcus was identified as the area where rCMRglc was inversely correlated with the number of left-right reversed characters. Previous functional imaging studies have suggested that the right superior parietal cortex and intraparietal sulcus play an important role in recognizing left-right reversed letters. Therefore, dysfunction in the intraparietal sulcus may hinder the recognition of left-right reversed characters, resulting in MW. Consequently, our findings in patients with PD are consistent with the visual-monitoring hypothesis of MW.",

    "abstract": "Sleep/wake alterations are predominant in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders involving dopamine dysfunction. Unfortunately, specific, mechanisms-based therapies for these debilitating sleep problems are currently lacking. The pathophysiological mechanisms of sleep/wake alterations within a hypodopaminergic MitoPark mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD) are investigated. MitoPark mice replicate most PD-related sleep alterations, including sleep fragmentation, hypersomnia, and daytime sleepiness. Surprisingly, these alterations are not accounted for by a dysfunction in the circadian or homeostatic regulatory processes of sleep, nor by acute masking effects of light or darkness. Rather, the sleep phenotype is linked with the impairment of instrumental arousal and sleep modulation by behavioral valence. These alterations correlate with changes in high-theta (8-11.5\u00a0Hz) electroencephalogram power density during motivationally-charged wakefulness. These results demonstrate that sleep/wake alterations induced by dopamine dysfunction are mediated by impaired modulation of sleep by motivational valence and provide translational insights into sleep problems associated with disorders linked to dopamine dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The claustrum is a sheet-like of telencephalic gray matter structure whose function is poorly understood. The claustrum is considered a multimodal computing network due to its reciprocal connections with almost all cortical areas as well as subcortical structures. Although the claustrum has been involved in several neurodegenerative diseases, specific changes in connections of the claustrum remain unclear in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Resting-state fMRI and T1-weighted structural 3D images from healthy elderly (n\u00a0=\u00a015), AD (n\u00a0=\u00a016), and PD (n\u00a0=\u00a012) subjects were analyzed. Seed-based FC analysis was performed using CONN FC toolbox and T1-weighted images were analyzed with the Computational Anatomy Toolbox for voxel-based morphometry analysis. While we observed a decreased FC between the left claustrum and sensorimotor cortex, auditory association cortex, and cortical regions associated with social cognition in PD compared with the healthy control group (HC), no significant difference was found in alterations in the FC of both claustrum comparing the HC and AD groups. In the AD group, high FC of claustrum with regions of sensorimotor cortex and cortical regions related to cognitive control, including cingulate gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and insular cortex were demonstrated. In addition, the structural results show significantly decreased volume in bilateral claustrum in AD and PD compared with HC. There were no significant differences in the claustrum volumes between PD and AD groups so the FC may offer more precise findings in distinguishing changes for claustrum in AD and PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that starts unilaterally in almost all cases and tends to emerge on the side of the dominant hand, but what we know about the cause of this lateralization is limited. Frequent use of the extremity and physical activity are argued to be protective from PD in preclinical and clinical studies. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of handedness and working in occupations that require continuous use of upper extremities on the disease onset-side.\nWe retrospectively collected 84 PD patients who applied to Ko\u00e7 University Neurology outpatient clinic between July 2016-October 2018. We analyzed the parameters of the side and region of disease onset, age of onset, number of drugs used for PD, hand preference, and patients' occupations.\nThe median age of our study group was 61 (53-69). Thirty (36%) of the 84 patients were women. Seventy-nine patients (94%) were right-handed. Eighty-three (99%) had asymmetric onset. The disease started on the dominant hand side in 47 patients (57%) and on the non-dominant hand side in 36 (43%) patients. In our group with a median disease duration of four (2-7) years, the side with more severe complaints measured with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Evaluation Scale was consistent with the onset-side of the disease (p<0.001). In addition, the number of drugs used for PD and the scale score were higher in patients with longer disease duration (p=0.039, p=0.005). The number of drugs used for PD was also higher in patients with lower extremity-onset or both upper and lower extremities affected simultaneously than the upper extremity-onset (p=0.005). While the probability of starting on the dominant side was 43% in patients working in occupations requiring continuous use of upper extremities, it was 65% in others (p=0.027).\nAccording to this study, the onset of PD tends to be on the dominant hand side. Continuous upper extremity use may reduce the possibility of starting on the dominant side.",

In our group with a median disease duration of four (2-7) years, the side with more severe complaints measured with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Evaluation Scale was consistent with the onset-side of the disease (p<0.001). In addition, the number of drugs used for PD and the scale score were higher in patients with longer disease duration (p=0.039, p=0.005). The number of drugs used for PD was also higher in patients with lower extremity-onset or both upper and lower extremities affected simultaneously than the upper extremity-onset (p=0.005). While the probability of starting on the dominant side was 43% in patients working in occupations requiring continuous use of upper extremities, it was 65% in others (p=0.027).",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-syn) has been shown to form various conformational fibrils associated with different synucleinopathies. But whether the conformation of \u03b1-syn fibrils changes during disease progression is unclear. Here, we amplified \u03b1-syn aggregates from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) staged in preclinical PD (pre-PD), middle- to late-stage PD (mid-PD), and late-stage PD (late-PD). Our results show that \u03b1-syn fibrils derived from the late-PD patient are most potent in inducing endogenous \u03b1-syn aggregation in primary neurons, followed by the mid-PD and pre-PD fibrils. By using cryo-electron microscopy, we further determined the high-resolution structures of the CSF-amplified fibrils. The structures exhibit remarkable differences in a minor but significant population of conformational species in different staged samples. Our work demonstrates structural and pathological differences between \u03b1-syn fibrils derived from PD patients at a spectrum of clinical stages, which suggests potential conformational transition of \u03b1-syn fibrils during the progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "Community-based exercise programs for Parkinson's disease (PD) have gained popularity. Our understanding of such programs on non-motor features is limited. We characterized the effect of a 12-week community-based boxing exercise program on motor and non-motor symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD).\nIn this prospective observational study, PwPD underwent a 12-week community-based boxing program (2 sessions per week, for a total of 24 sessions). The following assessments were performed by a movement disorders neurologist at baseline and after completion of the program: MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (MDS-UPDRS III) in a modified version since assessments were performed virtually due to COVID-19 pandemic, MDS Non-Motor Rating Scale (MDS-NMS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Lilli Apathy Rating Scale (LARS), Parkinson's Disease Questionaire-39 (PDQ-39), and Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living scale (SE-ADL). Pre- and post-assessments were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test; only participants who completed the program and both assessments were analyzed.\nA total of 14 PwPD agreed to be a part of the study and completed assessments. All participants were ambulatory and functionally independent at baseline. Total non-motor feature severity (MDS-NMS, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0031), depression (HDRS, p\u00a0=\u00a00.015), and motor features (MDS-UPDRS PART 3 modified, p\u00a0=\u00a00.023) all improved significantly after the intervention. Scales on apathy (LARS, p\u00a0=\u00a00.29), Parkinson's disease-specific health related quality (PDQ-39, p\u00a0=\u00a00.093), and activities of daily living (SE-ADL, p\u00a0=\u00a00.32) did not demonstrate significant change.\nPwPD who participated in a community-based, pilot boxing program showed improvements in motor exam and non-motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Although much is known about the multifactorial nature of falls in Parkinson's disease (PD), optimal classification of fallers remains unclear.\nTo identify clinical (demographic, motor, cognitive and patient-reported) and objective mobility (balance and gait) measures that best discriminate fallers from non-fallers in PD.\nPeople with mild-to-moderate idiopathic PD were classified as fallers (at least one fall; n\u00a0=\u00a054) or non-fallers (n\u00a0=\u00a090) based on previous six months falls. Clinical characteristics included demographic, motor and cognitive status and patient-reported outcomes. Mobility (balance and gait) characteristics were derived from body-worn, inertial sensors while performing walking and standing tasks. To investigate the combinations of (up to four) measures that best discriminate fallers from non-fallers in each scenario (i.e., clinical-only, mobility-only and combined clinical\u00a0+\u00a0mobility models), we applied logistic regression employing a 'best subsets selection strategy' with a 5-fold cross validation, and calculated the area under the curve (AUC).\nThe highest AUCs for the clinical-only, mobility-only and clinical\u00a0+\u00a0mobility models were 0.89, 0.88, and 0.94, respectively. The most consistently selected measures in the top-10 ranked models were freezing of gait status (8x), the root mean square of anterior-posterior trunk acceleration while standing on a foam with eyes open (5x), gait double support duration (4x) and the postural instability and gait disorders score from the MDS UPDRS (4x).\nFindings highlight the importance of considering multiple aspects of clinical as well as objective balance and gait characteristics for the classification of fallers and non-fallers in PD.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), the quality of life of both patients and caregivers is affected. While key issues relating to quality of life may not emerge in conversations with healthcare professionals (HCPs), unguarded social media conversations can provide insight into how people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) and their caregivers are affected. We conducted a qualitative and quantitative netnographic study of PD conversations posted on social media sites over a 12-month period.\nTo identify key themes and issues for PwPD.\nUsing predefined and piloted search terms, we identified 392,962 social media posts (between March 31, 2020, and March 31, 2021, for the UK and France, and between September 30, 2019, and March 31, 2021, for Italy, Spain, and Germany). A random sample of these posts was then analyzed using natural language processing (NLP), and quantitative, qualitative,in-depth contextual analysis was also performed.\nKey themes that emerged in the PD conversation related to the changing experience of symptoms over time are the physical, emotional, and cognitive impact of symptoms, the management and treatment of PD, disease awareness among the general public, and the caregiver burden. The emotional impact of motor symptoms on PwPD is significant, particularly when symptoms increase and PwPD lose their independence, which may exacerbate existing anxiety and depression. Nonmotor symptoms can also compound the difficulties with managing the physical impact of motor symptoms. The burden of nonmotor symptoms is felt by both PwPD and their caregivers, with the impact of nonmotor symptoms on cognitive processes particularly frustrating for caregivers. The experience of off-time was also featured in the online conversation. Some PwPD believe there is a lack of adequate management from healthcare professionals, who may not appreciate their concerns or take sufficient time to discuss their needs.\nThis study identified key themes that PwPD and their caregivers discuss online. These findings help signpost issues of importance to PwPD and areas in which their care may be improved.",

    "results": "Key themes that emerged in the PD conversation related to the changing experience of symptoms over time are the physical, emotional, and cognitive impact of symptoms, the management and treatment of PD, disease awareness among the general public, and the caregiver burden. The emotional impact of motor symptoms on PwPD is significant, particularly when symptoms increase and PwPD lose their independence, which may exacerbate existing anxiety and depression. Nonmotor symptoms can also compound the difficulties with managing the physical impact of motor symptoms. The burden of nonmotor symptoms is felt by both PwPD and their caregivers, with the impact of nonmotor symptoms on cognitive processes particularly frustrating for caregivers. The experience of off-time was also featured in the online conversation. Some PwPD believe there is a lack of adequate management from healthcare professionals, who may not appreciate their concerns or take sufficient time to discuss their needs.",

    "abstract": "A long-running debate concerns whether dopamine or noradrenaline deficiency drives response disinhibition in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to investigate whether damage to the locus coeruleus (LC) or substantia nigra (SN) might impact inhibitory functions of the fronto-subthalamic hyperdirect or fronto-striatal indirect pathway. Patients with PD (n\u00a0=\u00a029, 13 women) and matched healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a029, 15 women) participated in this cross-sectional study. LC and SN integrity was assessed using neuromelanin-sensitive MRI. Response inhibition was measured using fMRI with a stop-signal task. In healthy controls, LC (but not SN) integrity correlated with the stopping-related activity of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and right subthalamic nucleus (STN), which further correlated with stop-signal reaction time (SSRT). PD patients showed reduced LC integrity, longer SSRT, and lower stopping-related activity over the right IFG, pre-supplementary motor area, and right caudate nucleus than healthy controls. In PD patients, the relationship between SSRT and the fronto-subthalamic pathway was preserved. However, LC integrity no longer correlated with the stopping-related right IFG or right STN activity. No contribution of SN integrity was found during stopping. In conclusion, LC (but not SN) might modulate inhibitory functions of the right IFG-STN pathway. Damage to the LC might impact the right IFG-STN pathway during stopping, leading to response disinhibition in PD.",

    "abstract": "Depressive symptoms are common in patients with Parkinson's disease and depression is a significant predictor of functional impairment, reduced quality of life and general well-being\u00a0in Parkinson's disease. Despite the high prevalence of depression, evidence on the effectiveness and tolerability of antidepressants in this population is limited. The primary aim of this trial is to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of escitalopram and nortriptyline for the treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease.\nThis is a multi-centre, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial in 408 people with Parkinson's disease with subsyndromal depression, major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder and a Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score of 14 or above. Participants will be randomised into one of three groups, receiving either escitalopram, nortriptyline or placebo for 12\u00a0months. Trial participation is face-to-face, hybrid or remote. The primary outcome measure is the BDI-II score following 8\u00a0weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes\u00a0will be collected at baseline, 8, 26 and 52\u00a0weeks and following withdrawal, including severity of anxiety and depression scores as well as Parkinson's disease motor severity, and ratings of non-motor symptoms, cognitive function, health-related quality of life, levodopa-equivalence dose, changes in medication, overall clinical effectiveness, capability, health and social care resource use, carer health-related quality of life, adverse effects and number of dropouts.\nThis trial aims to determine the effectiveness of escitalopram and nortriptyline for reducing depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease over 8\u00a0weeks, to provide information on the effect of these medications on anxiety and other non-motor symptoms in PD\u00a0and on impact on patients and caregivers, and to examine their effect on change in motor severity.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03652870 Date of registration - 29",

    "abstract": "Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is one of the most commonly mutated genes in familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Under some circumstances, LRRK2 co-localizes with microtubules in cells, an association enhanced by PD mutations. We report a cryo-EM structure of the catalytic half of LRRK2, containing its kinase, in a closed conformation, and GTPase domains, bound to microtubules. We also report a structure of the catalytic half of LRRK1, which is closely related to LRRK2 but is not linked to PD. Although LRRK1's structure is similar to that of LRRK2, we find that LRRK1 does not interact with microtubules. Guided by these structures, we identify amino acids in LRRK2's GTPase that mediate microtubule binding; mutating them disrupts microtubule binding in vitro and in cells, without affecting LRRK2's kinase activity. Our results have implications for the design of therapeutic LRRK2 kinase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The advent of recent high throughput sequencing technologies resulted in unexplored big data of genomics and transcriptomics that might help to answer various research questions in Parkinson's disease (PD) progression. While the literature has revealed various predictive models that use longitudinal clinical data for disease progression, there is no predictive model based on RNA-Sequence data of PD patients. This study investigates how to predict the PD Progression for a patient's next medical visit by capturing longitudinal temporal patterns in the RNA-Seq data. Data provided by Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) includes 423 PD patients without revealing any race, sex, or age information with a variable number of visits and 34,682 predictor variables for 4\u00a0years. We propose a predictive model based on deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the addition of dense connections and batch normalization into RNN layers. The results show that the proposed architecture can predict PD progression from high dimensional RNA-seq data with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.0 and a rank-order correlation of (r\u2009=\u20090.83, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) between the predicted and actual disease status of PD.",

    "abstract": "After more than 2 years of the pandemic, effective treatment for COVID-19 is still under research. In recent months, publications hypothesized amantadine's potential beneficial effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nTo compare the groups of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients who were administered amantadine chronically and those who did not take this medication in the context of the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection.\nAn observational, retrospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted among consecutive patients with idiopathic PD. The structured questionnaires were completed during the patient's follow-up visits at the Outpatient Clinic or during hospitalization. The questionnaire included the following informations: patient's age, duration of PD, Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) stage, comorbidities, medications, COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab test for SARS-CoV-2 with specified symptoms and their severity (home or hospital treatment). The vaccination status was verified as well.\nFive hundred fifty-two (n\u00a0=\u00a0552) patients participated in the study - 329 men (60%). The mean H-Y stage was 2.44 (range: 1-4) and the mean duration of PD was 9.6 years (range: 1-34). One hundred four subjects (19%) had confirmed COVID-19 infection. Subjects over 50 years of age had a significantly lower incidence of COVID-19 (17% vs 38%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) with difference also in mean H-Y stage (2.27 vs 2.49; p\u00a0=\u00a00.011) and disease duration (8.4 vs 9.9 years, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). There were no differences between patients with and without co-morbidities. In the whole analyzed group 219 (40%) subjects were treated with amantadine. Comparing COVID-19 positive and negative patients, amantadine was used by 48/104 (46%) and 171/448 (38%) respectively. 22% of patients on amantadine vs. 17% of patients without amantadine developed COVID-19. These differences were not significant. There were no differences in morbidity and severity of COVID-19 between amantadine users and non-users as well.\nCOVID-19 was less common in older (>50) with longer duration and more advanced patients. Amantadine did not affect the risk of developing COVID-19 or the severity of infection.",

Flexed posture, postural instability and bradykinesia were measured using the MDS-UPDRS part III. Walking speed was measured during the 10-m Walk Test and 6-min Walk Test.\nUnivariate analysis revealed that age, bradykinesia, flexed posture, and hip, knee and ankle weakness were all significantly correlated with walking speed over short and long distances. Multiple regression analysis revealed that age, bradykinesia, flexed posture and weakness of the hip and knee muscles together accounted for 47% of the variance in walking speed over a short distance, with age (R\nIn people with mild PD, weakness of the hip muscles and bradykinesia only make a significant relative contribution to walking speed over a long distance. Therefore, in people with normal walking speed over a short distance the 6-min Walk Test could be measured to more effectively identify the impact of motor impairments on walking.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine selected baseline acoustic features of hypokinetic dysarthria in Spanish speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD) and identify potential acoustic predictors of ease of understanding in Spanish.\nSeventeen Spanish-speaking individuals with mild-to-moderate hypokinetic dysarthria secondary to PD and eight healthy controls were recorded reading a translation of the Rainbow Passage. Acoustic measures of vowel space area, as indicated by the formant centralization ratio (FCR), envelope modulation spectra (EMS), and articulation rate were derived from the speech samples. Additionally, 15 healthy adults rated ease of understanding of the recordings on a visual analogue scale. A multiple linear regression model was implemented to investigate the predictive value of the selected acoustic parameters on ease of understanding.\nListeners' ease of understanding was significantly lower for speakers with dysarthria than for healthy controls. The FCR, EMS from the first 10 s of the reading passage, and the difference in EMS between the end and the beginning sections of the passage differed significantly between the two groups of speakers. Findings indicated that 67.7% of the variability in ease of understanding was explained by the predictive model, suggesting a moderately strong relationship between the acoustic and perceptual domains.\nMeasures of envelope modulation spectra were found to be highly significant model predictors of ease of understanding of Spanish-speaking individuals with hypokinetic dysarthria associated with PD. Articulation rate was also found to be important (albeit to a lesser degree) in the predictive model. The formant centralization ratio should be further examined with a larger sample size and more severe dysarthria to determine its efficacy in predicting ease of understanding.",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-synuclein is the synaptic protein majorly involved in neuronal dysfunction and death and it is well known for the last two decades as a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Alpha-synuclein is involved in neurodegeneration mediated through various neurotoxic pathways, majorly including autophagy or lysosomal dysregulation, mitochondrial disruption, synaptic dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Moreover, the alpha-synuclein aggregation has been associated with the development of several neurodegenerative conditions such as various forms of Parkinson's disease. The recent discovery in oligonucleotide chemistry has developed potential alpha-synuclein targeting molecules for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The present review article focuses on recent advances in the applications of oligonucleotides acting ",

    "abstract": "Postural instability and falls are considered a major factor of impaired quality of life in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). The knowledge of the time at which postural instability occurs will help to provide the evidence required to introduce fall-prevention strategies at the right time in PD.\nTo investigate whether postural instability of patients with different age at disease onset is associated with age or with disease duration of PD.\nPatients diagnosed with sporadic PD between 1991 and 2017 and postural instability (according to the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III, item 3.12 postural instability) were included, with strict inclusion criteria including regular follow-ups, agreement on data use, and exclusion of comorbidities affecting the free stand.\nApplying these strict inclusion criteria, we included 106 patients. Those younger than 50 years at PD onset took significantly longer to develop postural instability (\nIn PD, postural instability is primarily associated with the age of the patient and not with disease duration.",

    "abstract": "The precise mechanisms initiating and perpetuating the cellular degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) remain unclear. There is decreased expression of the main brain gangliosides, and GM1 ganglioside in particular, in the PD brain along with decreased expression of the genes coding for the glycosyltranferase and the sialyltransferase responsible for the synthesis of these brain gangliosides. However, potentially important pathogenic mechanisms contributing to the neurodegeneration in PD may also include altered levels of expression of genes involved in glycosylation, sialylation and sphingolipid synthesis and metabolism. Although various studies have described pathological lipid and glycolipid changes in PD brain, there have been limited studies of expression of glycobiology-related genes in PD brain. The current study was performed as an initial attempt to gain new information regarding potential changes in glycoprotein and glycolipid-related genes in PD by investigating the gene expression status for select glycosyltransferases, sialyltransferases, sialidases, sphingosine kinases, and lysosomal enzymes in the substantia nigra and putamen from patients with PD and neurologically normal controls. Results showed altered expression of glycosyltransferase genes (",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is effective for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, remote programming is widely used in Mainland China. This necessitates evaluating the ability of remote programming to achieve the ideal postoperative effect. Therefore, we aimed to retrospectively evaluate the effects of different programming modes on the effectiveness of STN-DBS 12 months postoperatively in patients with PD.\nClinical data were collected retrospectively, before and 12 months after surgery, in 83 patients with PD. Based on the programming modes voluntarily selected by the patients during 12 months postoperatively, they were divided into three groups, namely remote programming alone, hospital programming alone, and hospital + remote programming. We compared the programming data and the effects of different programming methods on STN-DBS-related improvements 12 months postoperatively among these groups. Furthermore, we analyzed STN-DBS-related improvements at 12 months postoperatively in 76 patients.\nThe effectiveness of STN-DBS was not influenced by the three programming modes. The postoperative Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores did not reveal statistically significant differences between the remote alone and hospital alone programming groups, except for motor examination. The postoperative decline in the levodopa equivalent daily dose was most apparent in the hospital programming alone group. The programming frequency of the hospital + remote programming group was considerably higher than that of the remaining groups. Seventy-six patients with PD displayed good STN-DBS surgical efficacy.\nProgramming modes do not influence the short-term efficacy of STN-DBS, and remote programming can yield a satisfactory surgical effect.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic dysfunction and degeneration are central contributors to the pathogenesis and progression of parkinsonian disorders. Therefore, identification and validation of biomarkers reflecting pathological synaptic alterations are greatly needed and could be used in prognostic assessment and to monitor treatment effects.\nTo explore candidate biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders.\nMass spectrometry was used to quantify 15 synaptic proteins in two clinical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cohorts, including PD (n\nAcross both cohorts, lower levels of the neuronal pentraxins (NPTX; 1, 2, and receptor) were found in PD, MSA, and PSP, compared with HC. In MSA and PSP, lower neurogranin, AP2B1, and complexin-2 levels compared with HC were observed. In AD, levels of 14-3-3 zeta/delta, beta- and gamma-synuclein were higher compared with the parkinsonian disorders. Lower pentraxin levels in PD correlated with Mini-Mental State Exam scores and specific cognitive deficits (NPTX2; rho\u00a0=\u00a00.25-0.32, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and reduced dopaminergic pre-synaptic integrity as measured by DaTSCAN (NPTX2; rho\u00a0=\u00a00.29, P\u00a0=\u00a00.023). Additionally, lower levels were associated with the progression of postural imbalance and gait difficulty symptoms (All NPTX; \u03b2-estimate\u00a0=\u00a0-0.025 to -0.038, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and cognitive decline (NPTX2; \u03b2-estimate\u00a0=\u00a00.32, P\u00a0=\u00a00.021).\nThese novel findings show different alterations of synaptic proteins in parkinsonian disorders compared with AD and HC.

In MSA and PSP, lower neurogranin, AP2B1, and complexin-2 levels compared with HC were observed. In AD, levels of 14-3-3 zeta/delta, beta- and gamma-synuclein were higher compared with the parkinsonian disorders. Lower pentraxin levels in PD correlated with Mini-Mental State Exam scores and specific cognitive deficits (NPTX2; rho\u00a0=\u00a00.25-0.32, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and reduced dopaminergic pre-synaptic integrity as measured by DaTSCAN (NPTX2; rho\u00a0=\u00a00.29, P\u00a0=\u00a00.023). Additionally, lower levels were associated with the progression of postural imbalance and gait difficulty symptoms (All NPTX; \u03b2-estimate\u00a0=\u00a0-0.025 to -0.038, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and cognitive decline (NPTX2; \u03b2-estimate\u00a0=\u00a00.32, P\u00a0=\u00a00.021).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which dopaminergic (DAergic) systems are destroyed (particularly in the nigrostriatal system), causing both motor and nonmotor symptoms. Hippocampal neuroplasticity is altered in PD animal models, resulting in nonmotor dysfunctions. However, little is known about the precise mechanism underlying the hippocampal dysfunctions in PD.\nStriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) infusions were performed unilaterally in adult Sprague Dawley rats. Both motor and nonmotor symptoms alongside the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the substantia nigra and striatum were confirmed in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. The neuronal architecture in the hippocampus was analyzed by Golgi staining.\nDuring the 7-8 weeks after infusion, the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats exhibited motor and nonmotor dysfunctions (especially anxiety/depression-like behaviors). Rats with unilateral 6-OHDA infusion displayed reduced TH+ immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral nigrostriatal pathway of the brain. Golgi staining revealed that striatal 6-OHDA infusion significantly decreased the dendritic complexity (i.e., number of crossing dendrites, total dendritic length, and branch points) in the ipsilateral hippocampal conus ammonis 1 (CA1) apical/basal and dentate gyrus (DG) subregions. Additionally, the dendritic spine density and morphology were significantly altered in the CA1 apical/basal and DG subregions following striatal 6-OHDA infusion. However, alteration of microglial and astrocytic distributions did not occur in the hippocampus following striatal 6-OHDA infusion.\nThe present study provides anatomical evidence that the structural plasticity in the hippocampus is altered in the late phase following striatal 6-OHDA infusion in rats, possibly as a result of the prolonged suppression of the DAergic system, and independent of neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Deregulation of SNCA encoding \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-SYN) has been associated with both the familial and sporadic forms of Parkinson disease (PD). Epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in PD. The intron1 of SNCA harbors a large unmethylated CpG island. Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1), a CpG island binding protein, can repress gene expression by occupying hypomethylated CpG-rich promoters, and therefore SNCA could be a target for TET1. We investigated whether TET1 binds to SNCA-intron1 and regulates gene expression.\nThe dopaminergic neuronal cell line, ReNcell VM, was used. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real time-quantitative PCR, Western blot, dot-blot, and Chromatin immunoprecipitation were conducted. The substantia nigra tissues of postmortem PD samples were used to confirm the level of TET1 expression.\nIn the human dopaminergic cell line, ReNcell VM, overexpression of the DNA-binding domain of TET1 (TET1-CXXC) led to significant repression of \u03b1-SYN. On the contrary, knocking down of TET1 led to significantly higher expression of \u03b1-SYN. However, overexpression of the DNA-hydroxymethylating catalytic domain of TET1 failed to change the expression of \u03b1-SYN. Altogether, we showed that TET1 is a repressor for SNCA, and a CXXC domain of TET1 is the primary mediator for this repressive action independent of its hydroxymethylation activity. TET1 levels in PD patients are significantly lower than that in the controls.\nWe identified that TET1 acts as a repressor for SNCA by binding the intron1 regions of the gene. As a high level of \u03b1-SYN is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of PD, discovering a repressor for the gene encoding \u03b1-SYN is highly important for developing novel therapeutic strategies for the disease.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the neuroprotective effect of L-theanine in Parkinson's disease and the underlying mechanism focusing on WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling mediated by the MAPK pathway. We treated MPTP-induced SH-SY5Y cells with various concentrations of L-theanine (50, 100, 200, and 500\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), and we also treated Parkinson's model mice with L-theanine. L-theanine treatment effectively reduced the immunohistochemical hallmarks of Parkinson's disease, particularly Lewy bodies and \u03b1-synuclein, and increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells. L-theanine also improved the motor dysfunction in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease model mice as measured by the rotarod test. The levels of several pro-inflammatory mediators that are overexpressed in Parkinson's disease, namely TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, COX-2, and MAC-1, were reduced following L-theanine treatment, and the levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, caspase-3, p53, and PARP-1 were significantly reduced. L-theanine regulated the oxidative stress-related factors SOD-1, GST, and NOX-4 by targeting several proteins related to WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling, i.e., \u03b2-catenin, WNT-3a, WNT-5a, TCF1/TCF7, and LEF1, via the MAPK pathway (p-JNK, p-ERK, and p-p38). Our results indicate that L-theanine is neuroprotective and has anti-inflammatory effects that could be beneficial for treating Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age associated neurological disorder which is specified by cardinal motor symptoms such as tremor, stiffness, bradykinesia, postural instability, and non-motor symptoms. Dopaminergic neurons degradation in substantia nigra region and aggregation of \u03b1Syn are the classic signs of molecular defects noticed in PD pathogenesis. The discovery of microRNAs (miRNA) predicted to have a pivotal part in various processes regarding regularizing the cellular functions. Studies on dysregulation of miRNA in PD pathogenesis has recently gained the concern where our review unravels the role of miRNA expression in PD and its necessity in clinical validation for therapeutic development in PD. Here, we discussed how miRNA associated with ageing process in PD through molecular mechanistic approach of miRNAs on sirtuins, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, dopamine loss, oxidative stress and autophagic dysregulation. Further we have also conferred the expression of miRNAs affected by SNCA gene expression, neuronal differentiation and its therapeutic potential with PD. In conclusion, we suggest more rigorous studies should be conducted on understanding the mechanisms and functions of miRNA in PD which will eventually lead to discovery of novel and promising therapeutics for PD.",

    "abstract": "The visualization and identification of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) (dentate [DN], interposed [IN] and fastigial nuclei [FN]) are particularly challenging. We aimed to visualize the DCN using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), predict the contrast differences between QSM and T2* weighted imaging, and compare the DCN volume and susceptibility in movement disorder populations and healthy controls (HCs). Seventy-one Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, 39 essential tremor patients, and 80 HCs were enrolled. The PD patients were subdivided into tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) groups. A 3D strategically acquired gradient echo MR imaging protocol was used for each subject to obtain the QSM data. Regions of interest were drawn manually on the QSM data to calculate the volume and susceptibility. Correlation analysis between the susceptibility and either age or volume was performed and the intergroup differences of the volume and magnetic susceptibility in all the DCN structures were evaluated. For the most part, all the DCN structures were clearly visualized on the QSM data. The susceptibility increased as a function of volume for both the HC group and disease groups in the DN and IN (p\u2009<\u2009.001) but not the FN (p\u00a0=\u00a0.74). Only the volume of the FN in the TD-PD group was higher than that in the HCs (p\u00a0=\u00a0.012), otherwise, the volume and susceptibility among these four groups did not differ significantly. In conclusion, QSM provides clear visualization of the DCN structures. The results for the volume and susceptibility of the DCN can be used as baseline references in future studies of movement disorders.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD), especially the \"L-dopa-unresponsive\" subtype, is associated with the dysfunction of non-dopaminergic circuits.\nWe sought to determine whether cortical sensorimotor inhibition evaluated by short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) related to cholinergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic activities is impaired in PD patients with L-dopa-unresponsive FOG (ONOFF-FOG).\nSAI protocol was performed in 28 PD patients with ONOFF-FOG, 15 PD patients with \"off\" FOG (OFF-FOG), and 25 PD patients without FOG during medication \"on\" state. Additionally, 10 ONOFF-FOG patients underwent SAI testing during both \"off\" and \"on\" states. Twenty healthy controls participated in this study. Gait was measured objectively using a portable Inertial Measurement Unit system, and participants performed 5-meter Timed Up and Go single- and dual-task conditions. Spatiotemporal gait characteristics and their variability were determined. FOG manifestations and cognition were assessed with clinical scales.\nCompared to controls, PD patients without FOG and with OFF-FOG, ONOFF-FOG PD patients showed significantly reduced SAI. Further, dopaminergic therapy had no remarkable effect on this SAI alterations in ONOFF-FOG. Meanwhile, OFF-FOG patients presented decreased SAI only relative to controls. PD patients with ONOFF-FOG exhibited decreased gait speed, stride length, and increased gait variability relative to PD patients without FOG and controls under both walking conditions. For ONOFF-FOG patients, significant associations were found between SAI and FOG severity, gait characteristics and variability.\nReduced SAI was associated with severe FOG manifestations, impaired gait characteristics and variability in PD patients with ONOFF-FOG, suggesting the impaired thalamocortical cholinergic-GABAergic SAI pathways underlying ONOFF-FOG.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) by its common understanding is a late-onset sporadic movement disorder. However, there is a need to recognize not only the fact that PD pathogenesis expands beyond (or perhaps to) the brain but also that many early-onset patients develop motor signs before the age of 50 years. Indeed, studies have shown that it is likely the protein aggregation observed in the brains of patients with PD precedes the motor symptoms by perhaps a decade. Studies on early-onset forms of PD have shown it to be a heterogeneous disease with multiple genetic and environmental factors determining risk of different forms of disease. Genetic and neuropathological evidence suggests that there are \u03b1-synuclein centric forms (e.g., SNCA genomic triplication), and forms that are driven by a breakdown in mitochondrial function and specifically in the process of mitophagy and clearance of damaged mitochondria (e.g., PARKIN and PINK1 recessive loss-of-function mutations). Aligning genetic forms with recognized environmental influences will help better define patients, aid prognosis, and hopefully lead to more accurately targeted clinical trial design. Work is now needed to understand the cross-talk between these two pathomechanisms and determine a sense of independence, it is noted that autopsies studies for both have shown the presence or absence of \u03b1-synuclein aggregation. The integration of genetic and environmental data is critical to understand the etiology of early-onset forms of PD and determine how the different pathomechanisms crosstalk.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder impacting patients' movement, causing a variety of movement abnormalities. It has been the focus of research studies for early detection based on wearable technologies. The benefit of wearable technologies in the domain rises by continuous monitoring of this population's movement patterns over time. The ubiquity of wrist-worn accelerometry and the fact that the wrist is the most common and acceptable body location to wear the accelerometer for continuous monitoring suggests that wrist-worn accelerometers are the best choice for early detection of the disease and also tracking the severity of it over time. In this study, we use a dataset consisting of one-week wrist-worn accelerometry data collected from individuals with Parkinson's disease and healthy elderlies for early detection of the disease. Two feature engineering methods, including epoch-based statistical feature engineering and the document-of-words method, were used. Using various machine learning classifiers, the impact of different windowing strategies, using the document-of-words method versus the statistical method, and the amount of data in terms of number of days were investigated. Based on our results, PD was detected with the highest average accuracy value (85% \u00b1 15%) across 100 runs of SVM classifier using a set of features containing features from every and all windowing strategies. We also found that the document-of-words method significantly improves the classification performance compared to the statistical feature engineering model. Although the best performance of the classification task between PD and healthy elderlies was obtained using seven days of data collection, the results indicated that with three days of data collection, we can reach a classification performance that is not significantly different from a model built using seven days of data collection.",

    "abstract": "The Mediterranean (MEDI) and Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diets have been associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) diagnosis. However, studies evaluating whether these diets are associated with disease progression in those patients already diagnosed are lacking. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether MIND and MEDI scores were associated with improved patient-reported outcomes. Additionally, we sought to explore which questions on the MIND and MEDI scales were more strongly correlated with PD symptom severity. Data were obtained from the ongoing Modifiable Variables in Parkinsonism study, using patient-reported outcomes in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PRO-PD) as the primary measure for symptom severity, and MIND and MEDI scales for diet score. After adjusting for age, gender, income, and years since diagnosis, for each 1-point increase in the MIND and MEDI scores, PRO-PD scores were 52.9 points lower (95%CI: \u221266.4, \u221239.4; p < 0.001) and 25.6 points lower (95%CI: \u221237.2, \u221214.0; p < 0.001), respectively (N = 1205). This study suggests MIND and MEDI scores are associated with fewer patient-reported symptoms over time, with each MIND point being twice as strong as a MEDI point in reducing symptom severity. Future dietary intervention trials should consider the MIND diet as a therapeutic strategy for improving long-term PD outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disorder that affects brain nerve cells responsible for body motion and remains incurable. p-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA) is the primary phenolic compound in Gastrodiae Rhizoma, known for its therapeutic benefits against neurodegeneration. However, the protective effect of HBA against Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of HBA in vitro 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD model in SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with various concentrations of HBA for 1 h and incubated with 100 \u03bcmol/L 6-OHDA for 24 h to induce cellular lesions. 2,5-Diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide was used to detect cellular viability. 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin oxidation detects reactive oxygen species (ROS). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. The cellular mitochondrial function was identified through the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of cytochrome c, and the synthesis of mitochondrial ATP. Expression of pro-and anti-apoptotic factors was measured by Western blot. HBA enhanced cell viability, blocked ROS overproduction, and reduced antioxidant activities induced by 6-OHDA. HBA also reduced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death caused by 6-OHDA. Moreover, HBA reversed the 6-OHDA-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, the downregulation of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, the Apaf-1 upregulation and the induction of caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP cleavage. This study shows that the protective effects of HBA against 6-OHDA-induced cell injury provide the potential preventive effects of HBA, making it a promising preventive agent for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. The etiology of PD remains unclear. However, several studies have demonstrated the interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors in PD. Early-onset PD (EOPD) is a subgroup of PD diagnosed between the ages of 21 and 50. Population genetic studies have demonstrated great genetic variability amongst EOPD patients. Hence, this study aimed to obtain a genetic landscape of EOPD in the Cypriot population.

    "abstract": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is increasingly employed as an ecological neuroimaging technique in assessing age-related chronic neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), mainly providing a cross-sectional characterization of clinical phenotypes in ecological settings. Current fNIRS studies in PD have investigated the effects of motor and non-motor impairment on cortical activity during gait and postural stability tasks, but no study has employed fNIRS as an ecological neuroimaging tool to assess PD at different stages. Therefore, in this work, we sought to investigate the cortical activity of PD patients during a motor grasping task and its relationship with both the staging of the pathology and its clinical variables. This study considered 39 PD patients (age 69.0 \u00b1 7.64, 38 right-handed), subdivided into two groups at different stages by the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) scale: early PD (ePD; N = 13, HY = [1; 1.5]) and moderate PD (mPD; N = 26, HY = [2; 2.5; 3]). We employed a whole-head fNIRS system with 102 measurement channels to monitor brain activity. Group-level activation maps and region of interest (ROI) analysis were computed for ePD, mPD, and ePD vs. mPD contrasts. A ROI-based correlation analysis was also performed with respect to contrasted subject-level fNIRS data, focusing on age, a Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIQ), disease duration, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), and performances in the Stroop Color and Word (SCW) test. We observed group differences in age, disease duration, and the UPDRS, while no significant differences were found for CRIQ or SCW scores. Group-level activation maps revealed that the ePD group presented higher activation in motor and occipital areas than the mPD group, while the inverse trend was found in frontal areas. Significant correlations with CRIQ, disease duration, the UPDRS, and the SCW were mostly found in non-motor areas. The results are in line with current fNIRS and functional and anatomical MRI scientific literature suggesting that non-motor areas-primarily the prefrontal cortex area-provide a compensation mechanism for PD motor impairment. fNIRS may serve as a viable support for the longitudinal assessment of therapeutic and rehabilitation procedures, and define new prodromal, low-cost, and ecological biomarkers of disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn)/Lewy bodies in the brain and -enteric nervous system. The etiology of the disease is not well understood, but bacterial and viral infections may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. It has been suggested that the gastrointestinal (GI) complications observed in PD patients may arise from bacterial dysbiosis, leading to curli/\u03b1-syn deposits in the enteric nervous system. Enteric bacteria secrete curli, a functional amyloid peptide involved in adhesion to surfaces, cell invasion, and biofilm formation. However, these bacterial amyloids can initiate additional \u03b1-syn deposits through immune system activation and cross-seeding. In this study, we investigate the humoral response against \u03b1-syn, curli peptides, and various bacterial and viral immunogen peptides in PD patients, and compare them with those in healthy controls (HCs). Polyclonal IgG antibodies (Abs) were detected against peptides derived from \u03b1-syn (\u03b1-syn100\u2212114), curli (Curli133\u2212141), Porphyromonas gingivalis Pg (RgpA800\u2212812, Kpg328\u2212339), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (LtxA1429\u2212445, LtxA264\u221280), Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP3865c125\u2212133, MAP1,4-a-gbp157\u2212173 and MAP_402718\u221232), Epstein\u2212Barr virus (EBNA1400\u2212413, BOLF1305\u2212320), and Herpes Simplex virus 1 (UI4222\u221236), as investigated by indirect ELISA of 51 serum samples from PD and 58 sex and age-matched HCs. Significant differences in OD (optical density) values and Abs positivity between PD patients and HCs were observed for Kpg (82.3% vs. 10.3%), followed by RgpA (60.7% vs. 24.1%), curli (51% vs. 22.4%), and UI42 (43.1% vs. 25.8%) in PD, compared to HCs sera (p < 0.001). No significant difference was found in the ODs obtained from other tested peptides in PD patients, compared to HCs. Significant positive correlations between OD values obtained by ELISA were observed for UI42 and curli (r = 0.811, p < 0.0001), Kpg and RgpA (r = 0.659, p < 0.0001), followed by LtxA1 and LtxA2 (r = 0.653, p < 0.0001). The correlation between the HY scale (Hoehn and Yahr Scale) and LtxA1 (r = 0.306, p < 0.028) and HY and Kpg (r = 0.290, p < 0.038) were significantly positive. This study reports a significantly increased humoral response against curli, Pg, and HSV-1 in PD patients, implying that they could be important factors in the pathogenesis of the disease. In addition, the high positive correlation between UI42 and curli may suggest the involvement of HSV-1 in GI dysbiosis. Therefore, the role of each individual pathogen and curli in PD needs to be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The classical behavioral defects of PD patients involve motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity, as well as non-motor symptoms such as anosmia, depression, and cognitive impairment. Pathologically, the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn)-composed Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) are key hallmarks. Glia are more than mere bystanders that simply support neurons, they actively contribute to almost every aspect of neuronal development and function; glial dysregulation has been implicated in a series of neurodegenerative diseases including PD. Importantly, amounting evidence has added glial activation and neuroinflammation as new features of PD onset and progression. Thus, gaining a better understanding of glia, especially neuron-glia crosstalk, will not only provide insight into brain physiology events but also advance our knowledge of PD pathologies. This review addresses the current understanding of \u03b1-syn pathogenesis in PD, with a focus on neuron-glia crosstalk. Particularly, the transmission of \u03b1-syn between neurons and glia, \u03b1-syn-induced glial activation, and feedbacks of glial activation on DA neuron degeneration are thoroughly discussed. In addition, \u03b1-syn aggregation, iron deposition, and glial activation in regulating DA neuron ferroptosis in PD are covered. Lastly, we summarize the preclinical and clinical therapies, especially targeting glia, in PD treatments.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of autonomic dysfunctions (e.g., urological dysfunctions) is a common phenomenon during the course of Parkinson's disease (PD) and resulting complications such as lower urinary tract infections (LUTI) are one of the leading causes of hospitalizations and mortality in patients with the condition. Therefore, the aim of this retrospective cohort study was to compare the most common levodopa-based treatment regimens (DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor (DCI) + carbidopa or benserazide) and to analyze the incidence of LUTI and antibiotic prescriptions in patients receiving the respective treatments.\nThis study was based on data from the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA) and included adult patients (\u226518 years) with an initial prescription of levodopa therapy including fixed-dose levodopa/DCI combinations in 1284 general practices in Germany between January 2010 and December 2020. Conditional Cox regression models were used to analyze the association between levodopa/DCI combinations and LUTI incidence and antibiotic prescriptions.\nCompared to levodopa + carbidopa, levodopa + benserazide therapy was significantly and negatively associated with LUTI (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.71-0.95). This association was stronger in women (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.65-0.92) than in men (HR: 0.93, not significant).\nEspecially in women, receiving levodopa + benserazide prescriptions was associated with a lower LUTI incidence. It is important for clinicians to keep this in mind, since LUTI is a leading cause of hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality in patients with PD.",

The characteristic pathology of progressive dopaminergic neuronal loss in people with PD is associated with iron accumulation and is suggested to be driven in part by the novel cell death pathway, ferroptosis. A unique modality of cell death, ferroptosis is mediated by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation. The mechanisms of ferroptosis inhibitors enhance antioxidative capacity to counter the oxidative stress from lipid peroxidation, such as through the system x",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation is one of the major pathological events in age-related Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology, predominantly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). UPS essentially requires core component ubiquitin; however, its role in PD pathology is obscure. This study aimed to investigate the role of ubiquitin-encoding genes in sporadic PD pathology. Both cellular and rat models of PD as well as SNCA C57BL/6J-Tg (Th-SNCA*A30P*A53T)39 Eric/J transgenic mice showed a decreased abundance of UBA52 in conjunction with significant downregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuronal death. In silico predictions, mass spectrometric analysis, and co-immunoprecipitation findings suggested the protein-protein interaction of UBA52 with \u03b1-synuclein, HSP90 and E3-ubiquitin ligase CHIP, and its co-localization with \u03b1-synuclein in the mitochondrion. Next, in vitro ubiquitylation assay indicated an imperative requirement of the lysine-63 residue of UBA52 in CHIP-mediated HSP90 ubiquitylation. Myc-UBA52 expressed neurons inhibited alteration in PD-specific markers such as \u03b1-synuclein and TH protein along with increased proteasome activity in diseased conditions. Furthermore, Myc-UBA52 expression inhibited the altered protein abundance of HSP90 and its various client proteins, HSP75 (homolog of HSP90 in mitochondrion) and ER stress-related markers during early PD. Taken together, the data highlights the critical role of UBA52 in HSP90 ubiquitylation in parallel to its potential contribution to the modulation of various disease-related neurodegenerative signaling targets during the early phase of PD pathology.",

    "abstract": "The most commonly used treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) is levodopa, prescribed in conjunction with carbidopa. Virtually all patients with PD undergo dopamine replacement therapy using levodopa during the course of the disease's progression. However, despite the fact that levodopa is the \"gold standard\" in PD treatments and has the ability to significantly alleviate PD symptoms, it comes with side effects in advanced PD. Levodopa replacement therapy remains the current clinical treatment of choice for Parkinson's patients, but approximately 80% of the treated PD patients develop levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in the advanced stages of the disease. A better understanding of the pathological mechanisms of LID and possible means of improvement would significantly improve the outcome of PD patients, reduce the complexity of medication use, and lower adverse effects, thus, improving the quality of life of patients and prolonging their life cycle. This review assesses the recent advancements in understanding the underlying mechanisms of LID and the therapeutic management options available after the emergence of LID in patients. We summarized the pathogenesis and the new treatments for LID-related PD and concluded that targeting pathways other than the dopaminergic pathway to treat LID has become a new possibility, and, currently, amantadine, drugs targeting 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors, and surgery for PD can target the Parkinson's symptoms caused by LID.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a heightened inflammatory state, including activated T cells. However, it is unclear whether these PD T cell responses are antigen specific or more indicative of generalized hyperresponsiveness. Our objective was to measure and compare antigen-specific T cell responses directed towards antigens derived from commonly encountered human pathogens/vaccines in patients with PD and age-matched healthy controls (HC).\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 20 PD patients and 19 age-matched HCs were screened. Antigen specific T cell responses were measured by flow cytometry using a combination of the activation induced marker (AIM) assay and intracellular cytokine staining.\nHere we show that both PD patients and HCs show similar T cell activation levels to several antigens derived from commonly encountered human pathogens/vaccines in the general population. Similarly, we also observed no difference between HC and PD in the levels of CD4 and CD8 T cell derived cytokines produced in response to any of the common antigens tested. These antigens encompassed both viral (coronavirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, cytomegalovirus) and bacterial (pertussis, tetanus) targets.\nThese results suggest the T cell dysfunction observed in PD may not extend itself to abnormal responses to commonly encountered or vaccine-target antigens. Our study supports the notion that the targets of inflammatory T cell responses in PD may be more directed towards autoantigens like \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) rather than common foreign antigens.",

    "abstract": "Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) is a flavonoid with numerous pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammation, yet its role in Parkinson's disease (PD) with microglia-mediated neuroinflammation remains unknown. In this study, the effects of ISL on inhibiting microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in PD were evaluated in the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD and in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglia. Our results showed that ISL prevented behavioral deficits and excessive microglial activation in MPTP-treated mice. Moreover, ISL was found to prevent the elevation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and mitigate the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), protein kinase B (AKT), nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF\u03baB), and inhibitor of NF\u03baB protein \u0251 (I\u03baB\u0251) in the substantia nigra and striatum of MPTP-treated mice and LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells. Meanwhile, in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells, ISL inhibited the production of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). In addition, the agonist of JNK partly abolished the inhibitory effects of ISL in LPS-treated BV-2 cells. Our results demonstrated that ISL inhibits microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in PD models probably through deactivating JNK/AKT/NF\u03baB signaling pathways. The novel findings suggest the therapeutic potential of ISL for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in PD.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative delirium can increase cognitive impairment and mortality in patients with Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this study was to develop and internally validate a clinical prediction model of delirium after deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease under general anesthesia.\nWe conducted a retrospective observational cohort study on the data of 240 patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus under general anesthesia. Demographic characteristics, clinical evaluation, imaging data, laboratory data, and surgical anesthesia information were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was used to develop the prediction model for postoperative delirium.\nA total of 159 patients were included in the cohort, of which 38 (23.90%) had postoperative delirium. Smoking (OR 4.51, 95% CI 1.56-13.02, \nThis study provides evidence for the independent inducing factors of delirium after deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease under general anesthesia. By predicting the development of delirium, our model may identify high-risk groups that can benefit from early or preventive intervention.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease may present difficulties in performing dual tasks. The use of dual tasks during training can improve different abilities. Therefore, the objective of this study is creating a protocol, based on standard protocol items recommendations for interventional trials compliant, for a clinical trial study conduct, review, reporting, and interpretation. This protocol will provide the framework and a guide to a randomized double-blind study, that will be conducted to assess the influence of a cycling exercise program combined with a cognitive task, on cognitive and physical Parkinson disease aspects.\nDesigned a protocol for a double-blind randomized study, where participants will perform a dual tasks intervention with cycling and a cognitive task. The revised version of the unified Parkinson disease rating scale, the Parkinson disease questionnaire, the timed up and go Test, the 30 seconds chair sit to stand test, the Stroop and the trail making test will be used to measure outcomes.\nResearch in Parkinson disease suggests that an improvement of motor and cognitive functions of Parkinson disease patients can be achieved by modifying different motor and cognitive pathways. The results of the present study will yield findings on both the physical and cognitive response to an intervention that combines a cognitive task with a motor task in Parkinson disease patients and will be essential tool for a better conducting of the clinical trial study.",

    "abstract": "The protein dyshomeostasis is identified as the hallmark of many age-related neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD). The diseased brain shows the deposition of Lewy bodies composed of \u03b1-synuclein protein aggregates. Functional proteostasis is characterized by the well-coordinated signaling network constituting unfolded protein response (UPR), the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP). These networks ensure proper synthesis, folding, confirmation, and degradation of protein i.e., \u03b1-synuclein protein in PD. The proper functioning the of intricately woven proteostasis network is quite resilient to sustain under the influence of stressors. The synuclein protein turnover is hugely influenced by the autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked mutational changes of a gene involved in UPR, UPS, and ALP. The methylation, acetylation-related epigenetic modifications of DNA and histone proteins along with microRNA-mediated transcriptional changes also lead to extensive proteostasis dysregulation. The result of defective proteostasis is the deposition of many proteins which start appearing in the biofluids and can be identified as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of PD. The therapeutic intervention targeted at different strata of proteostasis machinery holds great possibilities for delaying the age-related accumulation of pathological hallmarks.",

    "abstract": "The early differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical Parkinsonian syndromes (APS), including corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), is challenging because of an overlap of clinical features and the lack of reliable biomarkers. Neural-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) isolated from blood provide a window into the brain's biochemistry and may assist in distinguishing between PD and APS. We verified in a case-control study whether oligomeric \u03b1-Synuclein and Tau aggregates isolated from NDEVs could allow the differential diagnosis of these conditions. Blood sampling and clinical data, including disease duration, motor severity, global cognition, and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), were collected from patients with a diagnosis of either PD (n\u00a0=\u00a070), PSP (n\u00a0=\u00a021), or CBD (n\u00a0=\u00a019). NDEVs were isolated from serum by immunocapture using an antibody against the neuronal surface marker L1CAM; oligomeric \u03b1-Synuclein and aggregated Tau were measured by ELISA. NDEVs analyses showed that oligomeric \u03b1-Synuclein is significantly augmented in PD compared to APS, whereas Tau aggregates are significantly increased in APS compared to PD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). ROC analyses showed that these two biomarkers have a \"good\" power of classification (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 for both proteins), with high sensitivity and specificity, with NDEVs concentration of Tau aggregates and oligomeric \u03b1-Synuclein being respectively the best biomarker for PD/PSP and PD/CBD diagnostic differentiation. Logistic and multiple regression analysis confirmed that NDEVs-derived oligomeric \u03b1-Synuclein and Tau aggregates differentiate PD from CBD and PSP (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Notably, a positive correlation between NDEVs oligomeric \u03b1-Synuclein and disease severity (disease duration, p\u00a0=\u00a00.023; Modified H&Y, p\u00a0=\u00a00.015; UPDRS motor scores, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) was found in PD patients and, in these same patients, NDEVs Tau aggregates concentration inversely correlated with global cognitive scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.043). A minimally invasive blood test measuring the concentration of \u03b1-synuclein and Tau aggregates in NDEVs can represent a promising tool to distinguish with high sensitivity and specificity PD from CBD or PSP patients. Optimization and validation of these data will be needed to confirm the diagnostic value of these biomarkers in distinguishing synucleinopathies from taupathies.",

    "abstract": "Human neuronal cells are a more appropriate cell model for neurological disease studies such as Alzheimer and Parkinson's disease. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells have been widely used for differentiation into a mature neuronal cell phenotype. The cellular differentiation process begins with retinoic acid incubation, followed by incubation with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a recombinant protein produced in E. coli cells. Endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major component of the outer membrane of bacterial cells that triggers the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ultimately cell death. Consequently, any endotoxin contamination of the recombinant BDNF used for cell culture experiments would impact on data interpretation. Therefore, in this study, we expressed the BDNF recombinant protein in bacterial endotoxin-free cells that were engineered to modify the oligosaccharide chain of LPS rendering the LPS unable to trigger the immune response of human cells. The expression of DCX and MAP-2 in differentiated cells indicate that in-house and commercial BDNF are equally effective in inducing differentiation. This suggests that our in-house BDNF protein can be used to differentiate SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells without the need for an endotoxin removal step.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an unparalleled example of a\u00a0neurodegenerative disorder that can be effectively managed leading to sustained symptom control and quality of life. The cooperation of neurologists with general practitioners, gastroenterologists, and geriatricians is of increasing importance for an optimized management of PD. New diagnostic criteria for PD and for atypical Parkinsonism, which should be considered in the differential diagnostics, include non-motor symptoms and aim to diagnose these disorders as early as possible. Recent research has shown that there are highly complex and clinically relevant interactions with PD at all levels of the gastrointestinal tract, which have been increasingly better understood and have direct clinical relevance. Novel dopaminergic treatment approaches focus on circumvention of the impaired gastrointestinal tract of PD patients. The management of geriatric PD patients and PD dementia requires specific clinical knowledge. Worldwide, PD has emerged as a\u00a0model disease for the development of network structures for the treatment of chronic neurological diseases.\nDie Parkinson-Krankheit (PK) ist das eindr\u00fccklichste Beispiel f\u00fcr eine effektiv therapierbare neurodegenerative Erkrankung mit lang anhaltender stabiler Symptomkontrolle und Lebensqualit\u00e4t.

Neue Diagnosekriterien f\u00fcr die PK, aber auch f\u00fcr differenzialdiagnostisch zu erw\u00e4gende atypische Parkinson-Syndrome beziehen nichtmotorische Symptome ein und haben das Ziel der m\u00f6glichst fr\u00fchen Diagnosestellung. Auf allen Ebenen des Gastrointestinaltrakts bestehen hochkomplexe Interaktionen mit der PK, die in den letzten Jahren immer besser verstanden wurden und unmittelbare klinische Relevanz haben. Neue dopaminerge Therapieoptionen fokussieren auch auf eine Umgehung des gest\u00f6rten Gastrointestinaltrakts. Das Management der PK bei geriatrischen Patienten sowie der Parkinson-Demenz erfordert spezifisches Wissen. Die PK ist weltweit eine Modellkrankheit f\u00fcr die Entwicklung von Netzwerkstrukturen zur Versorgung chronisch-neurologischer Erkrankungen.",

    "abstract": "Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) is a rare congenital arrhythmia that could result in peripartum cardiomyopathy. This condition could be managed by medical treatments or ablation treatments. In this report, we presented a 14-year-old pregnant girl with initial signs of syncope and palpitation, who was later diagnosed with WPW-induced peripartum cardiomyopathy. The baby was successfully delivered at 32 weeks gestational age, and the patient received a beta-blocker as the main treatment strategy. We recommend that a proper cardiology and gynecology care is critical in providing the best prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Examination of post-mortem brain tissues has previously revealed a strong association between Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Evidence in the literature regarding the circulation of ER stress-regulated factors released from neurons provides a rationale for investigating ER stress biomarkers in the blood to aid diagnosis of PD. The levels of ER stress-regulated proteins in serum collected from 29 PD patients and 24 non-PD controls were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A panel of four biomarkers, protein disulfide-isomerase A1, protein disulfide-isomerase A3, mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor, and clusterin, together with age and gender had higher ability (area under the curve 0.64, sensitivity 66%, specificity 57%) and net benefit to discriminate PD patients from the non-PD group compared with other analyzed models. Addition of oligomeric and total \u03b1-synuclein to the model did not improve the diagnostic power of the biomarker panel. We provide evidence that ER stress-regulated proteins merit further investigation for their potential as diagnostic biomarkers of PD.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine whether reduced lingual strength was associated with functional swallowing outcomes in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Participants (N\u2009=\u200942) completed evaluations of maximal lingual isometric pressure (MIP) and mean lingual swallowing pressure (MSP), and flexible endoscopic evaluations of swallowing. Regression models were used to determine the association between lingual strength and functional swallowing outcomes of airway invasion, the presence of post-swallow pharyngeal residue, and the amount of pharyngeal residue (when present). Results revealed that higher MIP (p\u2009=\u20090.002, OR 0.93) and higher MSP (p\u2009=\u20090.001 OR 0.88) were associated with less airway invasion of thin liquids. Both MIP and MSP were able to differentiate between those with and without dysphagia (MIP: AUC 0.7935, p\u2009=\u20090.001; MSP: AUC 0.75, p\u2009=\u20090.026). Neither MIP nor MSP was related to the presence of residue. However, when thin liquid oropharyngeal residue was present, both MIP (p\u2009<\u20090.001, OR 0.99) and MSP (p\u2009<\u20090.001; OR 0.98) were significantly associated with the amount of residue observed. Similarly, when thin liquid hypopharyngeal residue was present, MIP (p\u2009<\u20090.001, OR 0.99) and MSP (p\u2009<\u20090.001, OR 0.98) were associated with the amount of residue observed. These findings suggest a relationship between reduced lingual strength and worse thin liquid swallowing safety and efficiency; however, the magnitude of these effects was small. This indicates that lingual strength is one important contributing factor to functional swallowing impairments in PD and may identify those with unsafe swallowing. These findings have important clinical implications for including lingual strength in the screening, assessment, and management of dysphagia in PD.",

    "abstract": "Studies suggest swallow intervention programmes that incorporate visual biofeedback and motor programming principles can improve swallowing and quality of life for people with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and dysphagia. Few studies have examined outcomes using instrumentation.\nUsing fibreoptic endoscopic examination of swallowing (FEES), this study examines the effectiveness of a neurorehabilitation intervention involving biofeedback via surface electromyography (sEMG) to improve swallowing in people with IPD, and to explore the feasibility of the intervention approach.\nWe recruited 12 participants with IPD and dysphagia. A total of 10 completed the study. Intervention was delivered for 1 h per day, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks (20 h). Swallowing tasks using sEMG biofeedback incorporated principles of motor learning and neuroplasticity. Instrumental and non-instrumental assessment, including quality-of-life measures carried out at four different time points (two pre-treatment and two post-treatment). The final assessment was at 3 months post-intervention.\nStatistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) in oral intake methods (95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.70-5.50) and in pharyngeal residue from saliva (95% CI = 2.14-3.15) and solids (95% CI = 2.4-3.5) post-intervention were confirmed using FEES with improvements at 3 months. The intervention protocol was well tolerated. Participants reported positive change in saliva control and duration of mealtimes as well as unanticipated improvements in voice and cognitive attention.\nAn intensive neurorehabilitation with biofeedback shows positive effects in improving swallow function in IPD. This protocol is feasible with amendments to inform a larger clinical trial.\nWhat is already known on the subject Biofeedback has positive effects on increasing swallowing function and quality of life in people with IPD and dysphagia. sEMG is the most common method used to deliver swallowing biofeedback in this population. The quality of the evidence on the intervention, based on findings from a recent systematic review, is low. Included studies in this review were heterogeneous in terms of type and frequency of biofeedback, study design and outcome measures. The majority of outcome measures were subjective and higher quality studies to examine the efficacy of biofeedback using sEMG are needed. What this study adds Recognizing the limitations of earlier studies, this within-subject feasibility study examined the efficacy and effectiveness of an intensive biofeedback intervention using sEMG in a sample of people with dysphagia and IPD. Valid and reliable outcome measures were used and repeated after a 3-month period. The feasibility of the methodological approach was also tested and a qualitative component was included in the study. Positive findings were evident. Qualitative information added new perspectives and provided direction for new outcomes to be included in future studies. This study helps to inform further research trials as well as clinical practice. Clinical implications of this study This intensive intervention using principles of neuroplasticity and motor programming with sEMG biofeedback led not only to positive swallowing outcomes but also to unexpected benefits such as improved voice production and general attention skills. No adverse events were reported. Improvement in function was retained at 3 months post-intervention. Despite the small sample size, participants described the benefits of the treatment, and enjoyed sEMG biofeedback tasks, especially using an sEMG game mode. This suggests that intensive biofeedback not only improved swallowing but also was acceptable to these participants. This intensive protocol has merit and is worth considering further in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common and considered the most incapacitating non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). Little is known about OH in Ethiopian PD patients. The objectives of the present study were to determine the frequency and factors associated with OH in individuals diagnosed with PD compared to a healthy control.\nA multi-center case-control observational study was conducted. A total of 53 PD cases and 53 age and sex matched healthy controls were included. Both descriptive and Chi-square proportional statistical analysis were used.\nThe mean age distribution was comparable between the two study groups (61.9 vs. 59.9 years). Distribution of male gender was comparable between PD and control groups (71.7% vs. 67.9%). Nearly all the individuals diagnosed with PD were on levodopa treatment, and close to half of them were on anticholinergic drugs. Hypertension was the commonest comorbid disorder in both groups. The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension was higher in PD patients (22.6%) compared to the control group (9.4%). The proportion of constipation (p=0.007), urinary urgency (p=0.007), and nocturia (p<0.0001) was significantly higher among Parkinson's disease patients compared to the healthy control group. Falls and excessive sweating were only reported by PD patients.\nThe present study shows the frequency of orthostatic hypotension in Ethiopian Parkinson's disease patients is comparable to other regions. The presence of constipation, urinary urgency, and nocturia was associated with Parkinson's disease compared to the control group.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore possible biomarkers of postoperative delirium (POD) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients received deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nuclei.\nThis nested case control study analyzed perioperative plasma and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of patients (n = 40) who developed POD undergone DBS surgery (n = 10) and those who did not (n = 30). Blood sample was collected before surgery and on the first day postoperative, CSF sample was collected at the beginning of the operation. POD was assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) twice a day between 7:00 am and 7:00 pm after the surgery until discharge. Plasma and CSF sample from the two groups were analyzed to investigate possible biomarkers for POD in PD patients.\nThere was no difference between POD and Non-POD groups on the concentration of Interleukin 6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 in CSF, preoperative plasma and postoperative plasma. There was no difference between POD and Non-POD groups on the concentration of S100 calcium-binding protein \u03b2 protein (S100\u03b2) and Neurofilament light chain (NFL) in preoperative plasma and postoperative plasma. The concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), NFL and S100\u03b2 were significant higher in POD group than non-POD group in CSF. The concentration of CRP was significantly higher in POD group than non-POD group in preoperative plasma and postoperative plasma. CSF concentration of S100\u03b2 might be a potential biomarker for POD via the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and the area under the curve value of 0.973.\nFor PD patients received DBS surgery, CSF S100\u03b2 might be a marker for aiding detection of high-risk patients with delirium. This requires further confirmation in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Axons, crucial for impulse transmission and cellular trafficking, are thought to be primary targets of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Axonal degeneration occurs early, preceeding and exceeding neuronal loss, and contributes to the spread of pathology, yet is poorly described outside the nigrostriatal circuitry. The insula, a cortical brain hub, was recently discovered to be highly vulnerable to pathology and plays a role in cognitive deficits in PD and DLB. The aim of this study was to evaluate morphological features as well as burden of proteinopathy and axonal degeneration in the anterior insular sub-regions in PD, PD with dementia (PDD), and DLB.\n\u03b1-Synuclein, phosphorylated (p-)tau, and amyloid-\u03b2 pathology load were evaluated in the anterior insular (agranular and dysgranular) subregions of post-mortem human brains (n\u2009=\u200927). Axonal loss was evaluated using modified Bielschowsky silver staining and quantified using stereology. Cytoskeletal damage was comprehensively studied using immunofluorescent multi-labelling and 3D confocal laser-scanning microscopy.\nCompared to PD and PDD, DLB showed significantly higher \u03b1-synuclein and p-tau pathology load, argyrophilic grains, and \u00a0more severe axonal loss, particularly in the anterior agranular insula. Alternatively, the dysgranular insula showed a significantly higher load of amyloid-\u03b2 pathology\u00a0and its axonal density\u00a0correlated with cognitive performance. p-Tau contributed most to axonal loss in the DLB group, was highest in the anterior agranular insula and significantly correlated with CDR global scores for dementia. Neurofilament and myelin showed degenerative changes including swellings, demyelination, and detachment of the axon-myelin unit.\nOur results highlight the selective vulnerability of the anterior insular sub-regions to various converging pathologies, leading to impaired axonal integrity in PD, PDD and DLB, disrupting their functional properties and potentially contributing to cognitive, emotional, and autonomic deficits.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to overcome the obstacle of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in therapeutic drugs of Parkinson's disease (PD), like rhynchophylline (RIN) entry by intranasal administration and to solve the problem of short residence time of drugs in the nasal cavity by the dosage form design of thermosensitive gel. We first conducted a study of the screening of absorption enhancers and 3% hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) was effective to improve the nasal mucosal permeability of RIN. By adjusting the ratio of different components in order to make the gel with adhesion and rapid gelation which were determined to be Poloxamer 407 (P407) 20%, Poloxamer 188 (P188) 1%, polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG-6000) 1% and HP-\u03b2-CD 3%. In addition, the characterization showed that the thermosensitive gel was network cross-linked, rapidly gelation upon entry into the nasal cavity and was stable as semi-solid state with adhesion as well as sustained release properties. Moreover, pharmacokinetic study was performed to evaluate the bioavailability and brain targeting of RIN thermosensitive gel and which were 1.6 times and 2.1 times higher than those of oral administration. We also evaluated the anti-PD effects of RIN thermosensitive gel in-vitro as well as in-vivo. The results showed that RIN thermosensitive gel was effective in repairing the motor function impairment, dysregulated expression levels of oxidative stress factors, and positive neuronal damage within the substantia nigra and dopamine caused by PD. The constructed intranasal drug administration strategy through thermosensitive gel provided a new choice for targeted treatment of PD together with other central nervous system diseases.",

Speech performance of patients with PD was compared in ON and OFF STN-DBS conditions.\nAll LTAS spectral moments including mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis across both monologue and reading passage were able to significantly distinguish between patients with PD in both stimulation conditions and control speakers. The spectral mean was the only LTAS measure sensitive to capture better speech performance in STN-DBS ON, as compared to the STN-DBS OFF stimulation condition (\nOur findings confirmed that LTAS is a suitable approach to objectively describe changes in speech impairment severity due to STN-DBS therapy in patients with PD.

    "abstract": "Despite the careful selection of candidate patients, the levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) remains challenging due to a complex interplay between motor and non-motor symptoms. We developed a random forest (RF) model to determine the postoperative motor outcome of patients with advanced PD at 2\u00a0years under the LCIG therapy by using motor and non-motor data from a Greek multicenter, observational registry (ForHealth S.A.).\nThis was a prospective 24-month, observational study of 59 patients with advanced PD under LCIG treatment from September 2019 to September 2021. Motor status was assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) parts III and IV. Non-motor symptoms (NMS) were assessed by the Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQ) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).\nWe demonstrated that the proper combination of motor and non-motor measures significantly determines the motor outcome (UPDRS-III year 2: 23.57\u2009\u00b1\u200914.22 p\u2009<\u20090.001), reducing the RMSE (root-mean-square-error) from 3.487279 to 3.066292, suggesting that the optimized model performed well. Based on the \"IncNodePurity,\" the major determinant factors of UPDRS-III (year 2) were, in descending order: UPDRS-III (year 0), disease duration, NMSQ (year 2), age, NMSQ (year 0), time off (hours) (year 2), time dyskinesia (year 0), quality of life (year 2) after the LCIG implementation.\nThe novelty of this model is the possibility to determine the motor outcome after two years of LCIG. This model could be also useful for not specialized Parkinson's neurologists, to improve patient counseling, expectation management, and patient satisfaction with LCIG therapy.",

    "abstract": "Although the effectiveness of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) for structural and functional outcomes has been widespread proven, few researchers investigated the impact of ARCR on patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD), which may have previously been viewed as a relative contraindication to ARCR.\nData were collected retrospectively for all patients who underwent ARCR for small- to large-sized rotator cuff tears between September 2014 and May 2019. Patients were eligible for the study if they indicated that they diagnosed with rotator cuff repair and had minimum 2-year postoperative outcome scores for the range of motion (ROM), the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC), the Constant-Murley Score (CMS), the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Propensity score matching (PSM), a statistical method, was used to screen a control group without PD matched 1:1 with similar age, sex, tear size, preoperative stiffness, and fatty infiltration, which have previously been identified as important factors influencing success rates.\nThree hundred and eighty-nine patients met all study criteria including required follow-up, of whom 31 and 358 with PD and without PD, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, the propensity score matched indicators were compared, patients with PD experienced significantly more pain (4.45\u2009\u00b1\u20092.43 vs. 0.52\u2009\u00b1\u20091.18; P<.001) and had lower WORC (49.10\u2009\u00b1\u200921.22 vs. 78.90\u2009\u00b1\u200917.54; P<.001), CMS (46.77\u2009\u00b1\u200922.24 vs. 79.45\u2009\u00b1\u200914.74; P<.001) and UCLA (21.11\u2009\u00b1\u20098.54 vs. 28.16\u2009\u00b1\u20096.16; P<.001) scores respectively than the matched control group. They also exhibited higher sleep disturbance (10.04\u2009\u00b1\u20095.36 vs. 5.19\u2009\u00b1\u20093.28; P<.001), as well as higher anxiety and depression psychological status at 24\u2009months (P<.001; P<.001). Overall clinical outcomes from preoperatively to postoperatively were not improved significantly for patients with PD vs. without PD.\nPatients with PD experienced significantly more pain, resulted in worse shoulder functional outcomes, and reported persistently diminished mental and physical health status. Shoulder surgeons should be cognizant of PD as an outcome-modifying variable when treating patients with rotator cuff tears. This finding suggested that the need for ARCR in patients with PD should be carefully considered in the light of personalized needs and physical conditions.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) has been reported to be an effective treatment for motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it remains unclear whether and in which motor domain aDBS provides greater/less benefits than conventional DBS (cDBS).\nTo conduct a meta-analysis and systematic review to explore the improvement of the motor symptoms of PD patients undergoing aDBS and the comparison between aDBS and cDBS.\nNineteen studies from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library database were eligible for the main analysis. Twelve studies used quantitative plus qualitative analysis; seven studies were only qualitatively analyzed. The efficacy of aDBS was evaluated and compared to cDBS through overall motor function improvements, changes in symptoms of rigidity-bradykinesia, dyskinesia, tremor, and speech function, and total electrical energy delivered (TEED). The overall motor improvement and TEED were investigated through meta-analyses, while other variables were investigated by systematic review.\nQuantitative analysis showed that aDBS, with a reduction of TEED (55% of that of cDBS), significantly improved motor functions (33.9%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and may be superior to cDBS in overall motor improvement (p\u2009=\u20090.002). However, significant publication bias was detected regarding the superiority (p\u2009=\u20090.006, Egger's test). In the qualitative analysis, rigidity-bradykinesia, dyskinesia, and speech function outcomes after aDBS and cDBS were comparable. Beta-based aDBS may not be as efficient as cDBS for tremor control.\naDBS can effectively relieve the clinical symptoms of advanced PD as did cDBS, at least in acute trials, delivering less stimulation than cDBS. Specific symptoms including tremor and axial disability remain to be compared between aDBS and cDBS in long-term studies.",

However, significant publication bias was detected regarding the superiority (p\u2009=\u20090.006, Egger's test). In the qualitative analysis, rigidity-bradykinesia, dyskinesia, and speech function outcomes after aDBS and cDBS were comparable. Beta-based aDBS may not be as efficient as cDBS for tremor control.",

    "abstract": "A cut-off of -2 z-score for striatal or putaminal SBR has been to date arbitrarily used to define an abnormal DaT SPECT in patients with suspected neurodegenerative parkinsonism. We aimed to experimentally identify the most accurate z-score cut-offs for SBR of striatal and substriatal regions to independently discriminate PD and DLB, with respect to essential tremor (ET) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) respectively.\nTwo-hundred twenty-five patients undergoing DaT SPECT were enrolled (seventy-five de novo PD, eighty ET, fifty DLB, and twenty AD). Semiquantification was computed by means of Datquant\u00ae software which returns measures of striatal SBR and z-scores with respect to 118 healthy volunteers belonging to the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). ROC analysis was used to identify most accurate cut-offs for z-score for striatum and substriatal regions (clinical diagnosis at follow-up as gold standard).\nPosterior putamen of the most affected hemisphere (MAH) with a z-score cut-off of\u2009 -\u20091.27 demonstrated the highest accuracy to differentiate between PD and ET (sensitivity 0.97, specificity 0.94). The whole putamen (z-score cut-off\u2009 -\u20090.96) was the most accurate parameter to support the diagnosis of DLB (sensitivity 0.74, specificity 0.95). Putamen to caudate ratio was accurate to detect PD (especially in early stages) while not DLB patients.\nWe experimentally demonstrated that different substriatal regions and cut-offs for z-score of SBR should be considered to support the diagnosis of either PD or DLB. The identified less conservative cut-offs showed higher sensitivity without a measurable reduction in specificity with respect to the arbitrary \u2009-\u20092 z-score.",

    "abstract": "The role of serum lipids in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the association between time-varying serum lipid levels and the risk of PD. This study included an assessment of the complete lipid profiles of 200,454 individuals from the 2002-2019 Korean National Health Insurance Health Screening Cohort. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the association between serum lipid levels over time and the risk of PD. Individuals in the lowest tertile of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol had a 1.17 times [hazard ratio (HR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.31] and 1.19 times (HR 1.19; 95% CI 1.06-1.34) higher risk of PD than those in middle tertile, respectively. Individuals in the highest high-density lipoprotein cholesterol tertile had a 0.89 times (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.79-1.00) lower risk of PD than those in middle tertile, but the association was less robust in sensitivity analyses. Serum triglyceride levels were not related to the risk of PD. Our results suggest that the serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels over time are inversely associated with the risk of PD. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings and reveal the underlying mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) can be classified into an akinetic-rigid (AR) and a tremor-dominant (TD) subtype based on predominant motor symptoms. Patients with different motor subtypes often show divergent clinical manifestations; however, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to characterize the cortical and subcortical morphological alterations in motor subtypes of PD. T1-weighted MRI images were obtained for 90 patients with PD (64 with the AR subtype and 26 with the TD subtype) and 56 healthy controls (HCs). Cortical surface area, sulcal depth (measured by Freesurfer's Sulc index), and subcortical volume were computed to identify the cortical and subcortical morphological alterations in the two motor subtypes. Compared with HCs, we found widespread surface area reductions in the AR subtype yet sparse surface area reductions in the TD subtype. We found no significant Sulc change in the AR subtype yet increased Sulc in the right supramarginal gyrus in the TD subtype. The hippocampal volumes in both subtypes were lower than those of HCs. In PD patients, the surface area of left posterior cingulate cortex was positively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, while the Sulc value of right middle frontal gyrus was positively correlated with severity of motor impairments. Additionally, the hippocampal volumes were positively correlated with MMSE and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores and negatively correlated with severity of motor impairments and Hoehn & Yahr scores. Taken together, these findings may contribute to a better understanding of the neural substrates underlying the distinct symptom profiles in the two PD subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Motor reserve (MR) may explain why individuals with similar pathological changes show marked differences in motor deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we investigated whether estimated individual MR was linked to local striatal volume (LSV) in PD. We analyzed data obtained from 333 patients with drug na\u00efve PD who underwent dopamine transporter scans and high-resolution 3-tesla T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance images. Using a residual model, we estimated individual MRs on the basis of initial UPDRS-III score and striatal dopamine depletion. We performed a correlation analysis between MR estimates and LSV. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of LSV, which is correlated with MR estimates, on the longitudinal increase in the levodopa-equivalent dose (LED) during the 4-year follow-up period using a linear mixed model. After controlling for intracranial volume, there was a significant positive correlation between LSV and MR estimates in the bilateral caudate, anterior putamen, and ventro-posterior putamen. The linear mixed model showed that the large local volume of anterior and ventro-posterior putamen was associated with the low requirement of LED initially and accelerated LED increment thereafter. The present study demonstrated that LSV is crucial to MR in early-stage PD, suggesting LSV as a neural correlate of MR in PD.",

    "abstract": "Impaired balance is a common symptom that increases fall risk in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). Although previous meta-analyses concluded that dance-based interventions could improve balance in PwPD, they have limitations, such as small samples and low rigor. Another overlooked issue is whether the effects of dance-based interventions depend on dance style and training duration. The primary purpose of this meta-analysis was to further examine the efficacy of dance-based interventions in improving balance in PwPD. The secondary goals were to compare the intervention efficacy of different dance styles and durations.\nFourteen randomized controlled trials (RCT) examining the effect of dance-based treatment on improving balance among 612 PwPD were included. Effect size (ES) was calculated as the standardized mean difference. Meta-analyses (one primary analysis and three subgroup analyses) were completed using random-effects models.\nResults showed a medium overall ES of 0.57 (95% confidence interval or CI: [0.29,0.84], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) in favor of dance versus control on improving balance in PwPD. The subgroup analysis of six dance styles revealed various ES ranging 0.40-2.00. Balance was significantly improved with dance compared to control group for 12+ week interventions (ES\u00a0=\u00a00.72, 95%CI: [0.37,1.08], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Interventions with 60- and 90-min classes produced similar ES for improving PwPD's balance (60-min ES\u00a0=\u00a00.54; 90-min ES\u00a0=\u00a00.68).\nDance-based interventions (particularly of 12+ weeks) could effectively improve balance among PwPD. More high-quality RCT are needed to determine the most beneficial dance styles and session lengths. These findings could inform future studies for designing/deploying effective dance-based balance training and fall prevention programs for PwPD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta. PD patients' brains show neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The present study aims to evaluate the neuroprotective activity of VD3 on astrocytes after their exposure to rotenone (ROT) a natural pesticide known to exhibit neurotoxic potential via the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. Cell viability parameters were evaluated by the MTT test and staining with 7-AAD in cultures of astrocytes treated and untreated with VD3 (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0\u00a0ng/mL) and/or ROT (10\u00a0\u00b5g/mL or 5\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), and the cytoplasmic production of ROS and the cell death profile were measured by flow cytometry. Glutathione accumulation and ultrastructural changes were evaluated and immunocytochemistry assays for NF-kB and Nrf2 were also carried out. The results showed that VD3 improved the viability of cells previously treated with VD3 and then exposed to ROT, reducing the occurrence of necrotic and apoptotic events. Furthermore, cells exposed to ROT showed increased production of ROS, which decreased significantly with previous treatment with VD3. Importantly, the decrease by ROT in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was significantly prevented after treating cells with VD3, especially at a concentration of 1\u00a0ng/mL. Therefore, treatment with VD3 protected astrocytes from damage caused by ROT, decreasing oxidative stress, decreasing NF-kB and Nrf2 expressions, and improving mitochondrial function. However, further investigation is needed regarding the participation and mechanism of action of VD3 in this cellular model of PD focusing on the crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-kB.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the role of innate and adaptive immune cell function in brain health and how it goes awry during aging and neurodegenerative diseases is still in its infancy. Inflammation and immunological dysfunction are common components of Parkinson's disease (PD), both in terms of motor and non-motor components of PD. In recent decades, the antiquated notion that the central nervous system (CNS) in disease states is an immune-privileged organ, has been debunked. The immune landscape in the CNS influences peripheral systems, and peripheral immunological changes can alter the CNS in health and disease. Identifying immune and inflammatory pathways that compromise neuronal health and survival is critical in designing innovative and effective strategies to limit their untoward effects on neuronal health.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein induced degeneration of the midbrain substantia nigra pars compact (SNc) dopaminergic neurons causes Parkinson's disease (PD). Rodent studies demonstrate that nigrostriatal dopamine stimulates pallidal neurons which, via the topographical pallidocortical pathway, regulate cortical activity and functions. We hypothesize that nigrostriatal dopamine acting at the basal ganglia regulates cortical activity in sleep and wake state, and its depletion systemically alters electroencephalogram (EEG) across frequencies during sleep-wake state. Compared to control rats, 6-hydroxydopamine induced selective SNc lesions increased overall EEG power (positive synchronization) across 0.5-60\u00a0Hz during wake, NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep, and REM sleep. Application of machine learning (ML) to seven EEG features computed at a single or combined spectral bands during sleep-wake differentiated SNc lesions from controls at high accuracy. ML algorithms construct a model based on empirical data to make predictions on subsequent data. The accuracy of the predictive results indicate that nigrostriatal dopamine depletion increases global EEG spectral synchronization in wake, NREM sleep, and REM sleep. The EEG changes can be exploited by ML to identify SNc lesions at a high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Constipation is a common nonmotor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and has been reported to increase the risk of developing PD. However, previous studies have yielded conflicting results. Understanding this correlation may promote early diagnosis and treatment of PD, which could help patients improve their quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the association between constipation and PD onset.\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. We searched the Medline, Embase, Scopus, SINOMED, and Cochrane databases as well as specific journals from inception to September 2021 for observational studies that evaluated the association between constipation and the risk of PD. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. Associations were summarized as odds ratios (ORs) using a random-effects model. Subgroup, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses were performed.\nSeventeen studies comprising 3,024,193 participants (case-control = 1,636,831; cohort = 1,387,362) were eligible for inclusion. The pooled OR for the association between constipation and PD was 2.36 (95% confidence interval: 1.93-2.88), although strong heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 90%, p < 0.01). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses indicated that study design and disease duration were the major sources of heterogeneity. A sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the outcomes. In addition, the prevalence of among those with prodromal PD was 20%, whereas it was only 11% in the control group (p < 0.01). Moreover, there were no significant age-based differences in constipation between the prodromal stage of PD patients and the controls (p > 0.05).\nConstipation has a relatively high incidence in the prodromal phase of PD and is associated with an increased risk of developing PD.",

    "abstract": "Although studies have explored some dietary patterns for Parkinson's disease (PD), more other dietary patterns and food item under the dietary pattern are needed to investigate. This study aimed to identify more categories of dietary patterns for PD and further explore the association of single food item with PD.\nThe 2015-2018 US National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) database was used for data extraction. The data on demographics and nutrient intake were collected. Dietary patterns were derived from food categories by factor analysis. The association between dietary patterns or single food item and PD was explored using logistic regression analysis in the overall and only in secure PD cases, and results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding participants using unsecure PD medication.\nAmong 5,824 participants aged over 50 years, 91 were diagnosed as PD. Factor analysis identified 5 major dietary pattern factors. We observed that the increased adherence to Mediterranean diet (MeDi) was associated with the reduced odds of PD (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65-0.93). The higher adherence to Western pattern was associated with the increased odds of PD (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.16-4.14). In addition, high intake of sweets under Western pattern was found to be associated with the higher odds of PD (OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.08-3.71).\nThe odds of PD decreased by higher MeDi adherence and increased by higher Western pattern adherence, especially sweets intake in this pattern, suggesting population \u226550 years should adhere to MeDi pattern and decrease the adherence to Western pattern, reducing the intake of sweets.",

    "abstract": "We previously showed that kaempferol (KAE) could exert neuroprotective effects against PD. It has been demonstrated that abnormal autophagy plays a key role in the development of PD. Mitochondrial dysfunction, involved in the development of PD, can damage dopaminergic neurons. Whether the protective effects of KAE were exerted via regulating autophagy remains largely undefined, however. This study aimed to investigate whether KAE could protect dopaminergic neurons via autophagy and the underlying mechanisms using a MPTP/MPP",

The discriminative abilities were evaluated using machine learning approach.\nThe HOFC networks in the PD group showed decreased segregation and integration. The normalized clustering coefficient and small-worldness in the HOFC networks were correlated to motor performance.

Several highly connected nodes (thalamus, paracentral lobule, calcarine fissure and precuneus) and improved classification performance were found based on HOFC profiles.\nThis study identified disrupted topology of functional interactions at a high level with extensive alterations in topological properties and improved differentiation ability in patients with PD prior to clinical symptoms of cognitive impairment, providing complementary insights into complex neurodegeneration in PD.",

    "abstract": "Clinical markers of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) encompass several mental non-motor symptoms such as hallucinations, apathy, anxiety, and depression. Furthermore, freezing of gait (FOG) and specific gait alterations have been associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD. Finally, although low cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-\u03b242 have been found to predict cognitive decline in PD, hitherto PET imaging of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) failed to consistently demonstrate the association between A\u03b2 plaques deposition and mild cognitive impairment in PD (PD-MCI).\nFinding significant features associated with PD-MCI through a machine learning approach.\nPatients were assessed with an extensive clinical and neuropsychological examination. Clinical evaluation included the assessment of mental non-motor symptoms and FOG using the specific items of the MDS-UPDRS I and II. Based on the neuropsychological examination, patients were classified as subjects without and with MCI (noPD-MCI, PD-MCI). All patients were evaluated using a motion analysis system. A subgroup of PD patients also underwent amyloid PET imaging. PD-MCI and noPD-MCI subjects were compared with a univariate statistical analysis on demographic data, clinical features, gait analysis variables, and amyloid PET data. Then, machine learning analysis was performed two times: Model 1 was implemented with age, clinical variables (hallucinations/psychosis, depression, anxiety, apathy, sleep problems, FOG), and gait features, while Model 2, including only the subgroup performing PET, was implemented with PET variables combined with the top five features of the former model.\nSeventy-five PD patients were enrolled (33 PD-MCI and 42 noPD-MCI). PD-MCI vs. noPD-MCI resulted in older and showed worse gait patterns, mainly characterized by increased dynamic instability and reduced step length; when comparing amyloid PET data, the two groups did not differ. Regarding the machine learning analyses, evaluation metrics were satisfactory for Model 1 overcoming 80% for accuracy and specificity, whereas they were disappointing for Model 2.\nThis study demonstrates that machine learning implemented with specific clinical features and gait variables exhibits high accuracy in predicting PD-MCI, whereas amyloid PET imaging is not able to increase prediction. Additionally, our results prompt that a data mining approach on certain gait parameters might represent a reliable surrogate biomarker of PD-MCI.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic Deep Brain Stimulation (STN-DBS) is a safe and well-established therapy for the management of motor symptoms refractory to best medical treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Early intervention is discussed especially for Early-onset PD (EOPD) patients that present with an age of onset \u2264 45-50 years and see themselves often confronted with high psychosocial demands.\nWe retrospectively assessed the effect of STN-DBS at 12 months follow-up (12-MFU) in 46 EOPD-patients. Effects of stimulation were evaluated by comparison of disease-specific scores for motor and non-motor symptoms including impulsiveness, apathy, mood, quality of life (QoL), cognition before surgery and in the stimulation ON-state without medication. Further, change in levodopa equivalent dosage (LEDD) after surgery, DBS parameter, lead localization, adverse and serious adverse events as well as and possible additional clinical features were assessed.\nPD-associated gene mutations were found in 15% of our EOPD-cohort. At 12-MFU, mean motor scores had improved by 52.4 \u00b1 17.6% in the STIM-ON/MED-OFF state compared to the MED-OFF state at baseline (\nThe present study-results demonstrate that EOPD patients with and without known genetic background benefit from STN-DBS with significant improvement in motor as well as non-motor symptoms. In line with this, patients experienced a meaningful reduction of additional neuropsychiatric features. Physicians as well as patients have an utmost interest in possible predictors for the putative DBS outcome in a cohort with such a highly complex clinical profile. Longitudinal monitoring of DBS-EOPD-patients over long-term intervals with standardized comprehensive clinical assessment, accurate phenotypic characterization and documentation of clinical outcomes might help to gain insights into disease etiology, to contextualize genomic information and to identify predictors of optimal DBS candidates as well as those in danger of deterioration and/or non-response in the future.",

    "abstract": "The experiment aimed to explore the effects of curcumin on motor impairment, dopamine neurons, and gut microbiota in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mice model.\nMice were randomly assigned to six groups: normal control group, solvent control group, MPTP group, curcumin-low-dose group (40\u2009mg/kg), curcumin-medium-dose group (80\u2009mg/kg), and curcumin-high-dose group (160\u2009mg/kg). After 14 days, each group of mice was subjected to the pole text, the hanging test, and the open-field test. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry was used to observe the survival of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. Moreover, ultrastructural changes were observed with a transmission electron microscope in mice striatal tissue cells. Then, 16S rRNA was used to assess changes in the gut microbiota.\n(1) Each dose of curcumin reduced pole climbing time and increased suspension score and total distance moved dose-dependently. (2) All curcumin groups improved cell wrinkling and vacuolar degeneration, increased the number of TH positives, improved cell survival, and the higher the dose of curcumin, the better the effect. (3) There were differences in microbiota composition and a relative abundance among the groups. The relative abundance of \nCurcumin regulates gut microbiota and exerts a neuroprotective effect in the MPTP mice model. This preliminary study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of curcumin for Parkinson's disease, providing clues for microbially targeted therapies for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) in people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) are often underreported and may remain untreated. Constipation is a common nonmotor symptom that can adversely affect health-related quality of life (QoL); however, the impact of other GIS has not been adequately investigated.\nTo investigate the relationship between QoL and constipation using the Bristol Stool Chart, bowel movement frequency, and a perceived constipation measure; and to explore the relationship between QoL and other GIS in an Australian PD cohort.\nThe impact of constipation and other GIS on QoL, as measured using the PDQ-39 scale, was assessed in a cohort of 144 (89 males, 55 females) clinic-attending PwP. Constipation was assessed using the Bristol Stool Chart as well as a composite constipation measure, and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) was used to rate other GIS. Covariate corrected linear regression models were utilised to determine significant associations between GIS and QoL scores.\nIndividual and combined constipation measures were significantly associated with poorer QoL (\nThe findings point to the importance of GIS as contributor to health-related QoL in PwP. A better understanding of the relationship between GIS and QoL will help facilitate the development of more effective screening and treatment programs to improve symptom management and QoL for PwP.",

    "abstract": "General anesthesia is usually selected when patients cannot remain still during surgery with local anesthesia. However, damage to the lungs from positive pressure ventilation under general anesthesia is a major concern in patients with Parkinson's disease. We report a case in which dyskinesia related to Parkinson's disease was attenuated by intravenous dexmedetomidine (DEX) administration, following which epiretinal membrane (ERM) and inner limited membrane peeling could be smoothly performed. A 68-year-old woman with systemic dyskinesia related to Parkinson's disease underwent cataract surgery for her right eye with local anesthesia (topical anesthesia with 4% lidocaine and sub-Tenon's anesthesia with 2% lidocaine and 30% nitrous oxide inhalation). During the surgery, continuous involuntary facial movement related to Parkinson's disease remained uncontrollable. One week later, she underwent cataract surgery and pars plana vitrectomy for the ERM of her left eye. In addition to local anesthesia (topical anesthesia with 4% lidocaine and retrobulbar anesthesia with 2% lidocaine and 30% nitrous oxide inhalation), the patient received intravenous DEX, which halted movement from the beginning of surgery until the end. Therefore, ERM surgery was performed without the influence of dyskinesia. This case highlights that intravenous DEX administration can inhibit dyskinesia related to Parkinson's disease during ERM surgery, which is among the most delicate microscopic procedures performed in ophthalmological settings. Additional studies are required to examine the actual effectiveness of DEX administration in patients with Parkinson's disease-related dyskinesia undergoing ophthalmological procedures.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common form of neurodegeneration, and it poses a major threat to the quality of life of older adults. Stem cell transplantation, which has attracted widespread attention from researchers, is a new treatment that is demonstrating excellent potential for treating Parkinson's disease. This paper introduces the advantages, disadvantages, and current research on the progress of using stem cells for Parkinson's disease; briefly describes the strategies for controlling the differentiation of stem cells into dopaminergic neurons in vitro; highlights how transplanted cells improve the loss of dopaminergic neurons by interacting with the inflammatory microenvironment in the brain; and proposes that future stem cell research focus on finely regulating the signal pathways that influence the directed differentiation of dopaminergic neurons to maintain an appropriate balance between the modulatory factors that affect the inflammatory microenvironment and clarify the interaction between neurons and neuroglia.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are both age-related diseases of global concern being among the most common chronic metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, respectively. While both diseases can be genetically inherited, environmental factors play a vital role in their pathogenesis. Moreover, DM and PD have common underlying molecular mechanisms, such as misfolded protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and microbial dysbiosis. Recently, epidemiological and experimental studies have reported that DM affects the incidence and progression of PD. Moreover, certain antidiabetic drugs have been proven to decrease the risk of PD and delay its progression. In this review, we elucidate the epidemiological and pathophysiological association between DM and PD and summarize the antidiabetic drugs used in animal models and clinical trials of PD, which may provide reference for the clinical translation of antidiabetic drugs in PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of globus pallidus interna (GPi) is an established treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). However, in contrast to subthalamic nucleus (STN)-DBS, long-term outcomes of GPi-DBS have rarely been studied.\nWe investigated the long-term motor outcomes in PD patients at 5\u00a0years after GPi-DBS.\nWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical data for PD patients who underwent GPi-DBS. Longitudinal changes of UPDRS scores from baseline to 5\u00a0years after surgery were assessed.\nForty PD patients with a mean age of 59.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.9\u00a0years at DBS surgery (mean duration of PD: 11.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4\u00a0years) were included at baseline and 25 patients were included in 5-year evaluation after DBS. Compared to baseline, sub-scores for tremor, levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), and motor fluctuation indicated improved states up to 5\u00a0years after surgery (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, UPDRS Part 3 total score and sub-score for postural instability and gait disturbance (PIGD) gradually worsened over time until 5\u00a0years after surgery (p\u00a0>\u00a00.017 after Bonferroni correction). In a logistic regression model, only preoperative levodopa response was associated with the long-term benefits on UPDRS Part 3 total score and PIGD sub-score (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.20; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.04-1.39; p\u00a0=\u00a00.015 and OR\u00a0=\u00a04.99; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.39-17.89; p\u00a0=\u00a00.014, respectively).\nGPi-DBS provides long-term beneficial effects against tremor, motor fluctuation and LID, but PIGD symptoms gradually worsen. This selective long-term benefit has implications for the optimal application of DBS in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Saccade performance has been reported to be altered in Parkinson's disease (PD), however, with a large variability between studies as both motor and cognitive impairment interfere with oculomotor control. The aim of this study was to identify different patterns in saccade alterations in PD using a data-driven approach and to explore their relationship with cognitive phenotypes. Sixty-one participants with PD and 25 controls performed eye-tracking (horizontal and vertical prosaccades, antisaccades) and neuropsychological testing. Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to the eye-tracking data to subsequently compare the clusters based on demographical, clinical and cognitive characteristics. The three identified clusters of saccade alterations differed in cognitive profiles from healthy controls, but not in PD-related motor symptoms or demographics. The rate of directive errors in the antisaccade task was increased in clusters 1 and 2. Further, cluster 1 was defined by a general disinhibition of reflexive saccades and executive dysfunction in the neuropsychological evaluation. In cluster 2, prolonged saccade latencies and hypometria were accompanied by multidomain cognitive impairment. The cluster 3 showed increased antisaccade latency and vertical hypometria despite lack of evidence for cognitive impairment. Our results suggest that there may be at least two opposing patterns of saccade alterations associated with cognitive impairment in PD, which may explain some of the contradictory results of previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has been considered to be one of the most promising target diseases for forthcoming cell-based therapy. The aim of this study is to explore the views of individuals with cryopreserved embryos on using human embryonic stem cells for treating PD.\nThe study was performed as a qualitative, semi-structured interview study in June-October 2020. Participants were recruited at a private fertility clinic located in one of the larger Swedish cities. The clinic provides both publicly financed and privately financed IVF-treatments. All interviews were performed by telephone and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Five main categories emerged from 27 sub-categories.\nIn total, 18 interviews were performed with 22 individuals, as either a couple (n\u2009=\u200916) or separately (n\u2009=\u20096). Participants had different views on what a cryopreserved embryo is. Some participants addressed cryopreserved embryos as 'a lump of cells', and some in terms of their 'unborn child'. Conditions for donation of cryopreserved embryos for cell-based treatment in PD were: not losing control of what is happening to the embryo, that donating must be voluntary and based on informed consent with time for reflection, that reimbursement, equality and transparency.\nUsing cryopreserved embryos to treat PD is associated with fundamental ethical and practical issues. This study shows that IVF couples with left-over embryos may be supportive but there is a need for future research to assess people's views on using cryopreserved embryos for cell-based treatment in PD on a more aggregated level.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) gene-modified BMSCs (ERK-BMSCs) transplantation in ameliorating cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). The PD rat model was built by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection into the right striatum for 8\u00a0weeks, then successful PD rats were randomly divided into three groups and respectively transplanted in the same position of striatum as modeling with PBS, BMSCs and ERK-BMSCs for another 8\u00a0weeks. The 6-OHDA-induced PD rat model was successfully established, as demonstrated by reduced active avoidance response (AAR) times, percentage of time exploring in the light area (Ltime%) and platform quadrant time (PQT), as well as p-ERK expression. Compared with PBS rats, both BMSCs and ERK-BMSCs transplantation significantly reduced the left turn number, while increased AAR, Ltime%, PQT and p-ERK expression, suggesting improved cognitive abilities through restoring p-ERK expression. In addition, ERK-BMSCs injection exhibited higher therapeutic efficacy against cognitive deficits compared with BMSCs injection. These results demonstrated that BMSCs transplantation ameliorated cognitive deficits, and ERK-BMSCs exerted synergistic effects, which may prove beneficial against cognitive impairments in PD.",

    "abstract": "The identification of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) is important for the effective management of patients, affecting their treatment and prognosis. Recently, structural brain networks (SBNs) have been used to diagnose PD. However, how to mine abnormal patterns from high-dimensional SBNs has been a challenge due to the complex topology of the brain. Meanwhile, the existing prediction mechanisms of deep learning models are often complicated, and it is difficult to extract effective interpretations. In addition, most works only focus on the classification of imaging and ignore clinical scores in practical applications, which limits the ability of the model. Inspired by the regional modularity of SBNs, we adopted graph learning from the perspective of node clustering to construct an interpretable framework for PD classification.\nIn this study, a multi-task graph structure learning framework based on node clustering (MNC-Net) is proposed for the early diagnosis of PD. Specifically, we modeled complex SBNs into modular graphs that facilitated the representation learning of abnormal patterns. Traditional graph neural networks are optimized through graph structure learning based on node clustering, which identifies potentially abnormal brain regions and reduces the impact of irrelevant noise. Furthermore, we employed a regression task to link clinical scores to disease classification, and incorporated latent domain information into model training through multi-task learning.\nWe validated the proposed approach on the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative dataset. Experimental results showed that our MNC-Net effectively separated the early-stage PD from healthy controls(HC) with an accuracy of 95.5%. The t-SNE figures have showed that our graph structure learning method can capture more efficient and discriminatory features. Furthermore, node clustering parameters were used as important weights to extract salient task-related brain regions(ROIs). These ROIs are involved in the development of mood disorders, tremors, imbalances and other symptoms, highlighting the importance of memory, language and mild motor function in early PD. In addition, statistical results from clinical scores confirmed that our model could capture abnormal connectivity that was significantly different between PD and HC. These results are consistent with previous studies, demonstrating the interpretability of our methods.",

    "abstract": "The background of this study is to investigate whether striatal dopamine depletion patterns (selective involvement in the sensorimotor striatum or asymmetry) are associated with motor deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). We enrolled 404 drug-na\u00efve patients with early stage PD who underwent dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging. After quantifying DAT availability in each striatal sub-region, principal component (PC) analysis was conducted to yield PCs representing the spatial patterns of striatal dopamine depletion. Subsequently, multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between striatal dopamine depletion patterns and motor deficits assessed using the Unified PD Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS-III). Mediation analyses were used to evaluate whether dopamine deficiency in the posterior putamen mediated the association between striatal dopamine depletion patterns and parkinsonian motor deficits. Three PCs indicated patterns of striatal dopamine depletion: PC1 (overall striatal dopamine deficiency), PC2 (selective dopamine loss in the sensorimotor striatum), and PC3 (symmetric dopamine loss in the striatum). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that PC1 (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u00a01.605, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and PC2 (\u03b2\u2009=\u20093.201, p\u2009<\u20090.001) were associated with motor deficits (i.e., higher UPDRS-III scores in subjects with severe dopamine depletion throughout the whole striatum or more selective dopamine loss in the sensorimotor striatum), whereas PC3 was not (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.016, p\u2009=\u20090.992). Mediation analyses demonstrated that the effects of PC1 and PC2 on UPDRS-III scores were indirectly mediated by DAT availability in the posterior putamen, with a non-significant direct effect. Dopamine deficiency in the posterior putamen was most relevant to the severity of motor deficits in patients with PD, while the spatial patterns of striatal dopamine depletion were not a key determinant.",

Statistical analyses compared changes between the STN-DBS and BMT groups from baseline to 24\u00a0months.\nOver the 2-year period, changes in speech intelligibility and MPT, as well as patient-reported outcomes, were not different between groups, either off or on medication or OFF or ON stimulation, but most outcomes showed a nonsignificant trend toward worsening in both groups. Change in oral diadochokinesis was significantly different between STN-DBS and BMT groups, on medication and OFF STN-DBS, with patients in the STN-DBS group performing slightly worse than patients under BMT only. A signal for clinical worsening with STN-DBS was found for the individual speech item of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part III.\nAt this early stage of the patients' disease, STN-DBS did not result in a consistent deterioration in blinded speech intelligibility assessment and patient-reported communication, as observed in studies of advanced Parkinson's Disease. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor disturbances as a result of a complex and not fully understood pathogenesis, probably including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and formation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregates. As age is the main risk factor for several neurodegenerative disorders including PD, progressive aging of the immune system leading to inflammaging and immunosenescence may contribute to neuroinflammation leading to PD onset and progression; abnormal \u03b1-syn aggregation in the context of immune dysfunction may favor activation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NOD) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome within microglial cells through interaction with toll-like receptors (TLRs). This process would further lead to activation of Caspase (Cas)-1, and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (PC), with subsequent impairment of mitochondria and damage to dopaminergic neurons. All these phenomena are mediated by the translocation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) and enhanced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). To date, drugs to treat PD are mainly aimed at relieving clinical symptoms and there are no disease-modifying options to reverse or stop disease progression. This review outlines the role of the TLR/NLRP3/Cas-1 pathway in PD-related immune dysfunction, also focusing on specific therapeutic options that might be used since the early stages of the disease to counteract neuroinflammation and immune dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by an abnormal post-translational modifications (PTM) in amino acid sequence and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) protein. It is generally believed that dopamine (DA) metabolite in dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons promotes the aggregation of toxic \u03b1-Syn oligomers and protofibrils, whereas DA inhibits the formation of toxic fibers and even degrades the toxic fibers. Therefore, the study on interaction between DA metabolites and \u03b1-Syn oligomers is one of the current hot topics in neuroscience, because this effect may have direct relevance to the selective DAergic neuron loss in PD. Several mechanisms have been reported for DA metabolites induced \u03b1-Syn oligomers viz. i) The reactive oxygen species (ROS) released during the auto-oxidation or enzymatic oxidation of DA changes the structure of \u03b1-Syn by the oxidation of amino acid residue leading to misfolding, ii) The oxidized DA metabolites directly interact with \u03b1-Syn through covalent or non-covalent bonding leading to the formation of oligomers, iii) DA interacts with lipid or autophagy related proteins to decreases the degradation efficiency of \u03b1-Syn aggregates. However, there is no clear-cut mechanism proposed for the interaction between DA and \u03b1-Syn. However, it is believed that the lysine (Lys) side chain of \u03b1-Syn sequence is the initial trigger site for the oligomer formation. Herein, we review different chemical mechanism involved during the interaction of Lys side chain of \u03b1-Syn with DA metabolites such as dopamine-o-quinone (DAQ), dopamine-chrome (DAC), dopamine-aldehyde (DOPAL) and neuromelanin. This review also provides the promotive effect of divalent Cu",

    "abstract": "Sleep benefit (SB) is a well-known phenomenon in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate whether the SB phenomenon in PD patients is associated with dopamine transporter (DAT) expression levels in the striatum.\nThe data of 125 PD patients were collected and divided into SB (n\u00a0=\u00a061) and non-SB (nSB) groups (n\u00a0=\u00a054) depending on whether they had SB or not. DAT expression on both sides of the striatum in PD patients was measured using 2b-carbomethoxy-3b-(4-trimethylstannylphenyl) tropane (11C-CFT) positron emission tomography imaging. The clinical variables, sleep scores, and striatum 11C-CFT uptake index of PD patients between the SB and nSB groups were compared. The associations of clinical variables, sleep scores, and striatum 11C-CFT uptake index with the SB variable were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of the striatum 11C-CFT uptake index in distinguishing SB patients from nSB patients.\nThe tremor subtype ratio (P\u00a0=\u00a00.011), levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), sleep efficiency score (P\u00a0=\u00a00.025), habitual sleep efficiency (P\u00a0=\u00a00.012), and night sleep duration (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005) in the SB group were significantly different from those in the nSB group. The 11C-CFT uptake index in both the contralateral and ipsilateral striata in the SB group was significantly higher than that in the nSB group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The binary logistic regression showed that SB variables were significantly and independently associated with tremor subtype (P\u00a0=\u00a00.048), LEDD (P\u00a0=\u00a00.021), sleep duration at night (P\u00a0=\u00a00.035), 11C-CFT uptake index in the contralateral (P\u00a0=\u00a00.013) and ipsilateral (P\u00a0=\u00a00.019) putamen in PD patients after correction for important clinical confounders. ROC analysis showed that the 11C-CFT uptake index on the onset side of the putamen had a high capacity (AUC: 0.916) to distinguish SB patients from nSB patients with high sensitivity (83.33\u00a0%) and specificity (88.89\u00a0%).\nDAT expression in the putamen was associated with the SB phenomenon in PD patients, and the putamen DAT expression level could predict the SB phenomenon in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability and loss of vestibular and somatosensory acuity can be part of the signs encountered in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Visual dependency is described in PD. These modifications of sensory input hierarchy are predictors of motion sickness (MS). The aim of this study was to assess MS susceptibility and effects of real induced MS in posture. 63 PD patients, whose medication levels (levodopa) reflected the pathology were evaluated, and 27 healthy controls, filled a MS questionnaire; 9 PD patients and 43 healthy controls were assessed by posturography using virtual reality. Drug amount predicted visual MS (p=0.01), but not real induced MS susceptibility. PD patients did not experience postural instability in virtual reality, contrary to healthy controls. Since PD patients do not seem to feel vestibular stimulated MS, they may not rely on vestibular and somatosensory inputs during the stimulation. However, they feel visually induced MS more with increased levodopa drug effect. Levodopa amount can increase visual dependency. The strongest MS predictors must be studied in PD to better understand the effect of visual stimulation and its absence in vestibular stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and osteoporosis are degenerative diseases that have shared pathomechanisms. To investigate the associations of skull bone density with nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration and longitudinal motor prognosis in female patients with PD. We analyzed the data of 260 drug-na\u00efve female PD patients aged \u226550 years old who were followed-up for \u22653 years after their first visit to the clinic with baseline dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging. We measured skull bone density as a surrogate marker for systemic bone loss by calculating the Hounsfield unit (HU) in computed tomography scans. A Cox proportional hazard model was built to compare the rates of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) or wearing-off according to skull HU. Longitudinal changes in levodopa-equivalent dose (LED) during a 3-year follow-up were assessed using a linear mixed model. A lower skull HU was associated with lower baseline DAT availability in striatal subregions; however, this relationship was not significant after adjusting for age, disease duration, body mass index, and white matter hyperintensities. After adjusting for confounding factors, a lower skull HU was significantly associated with an increased risk of LID development (hazard ratio = 1.660 per 1 standard deviation decrease, ",

    "abstract": "Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a common motor complication in Parkinson disease (PD). Abnormal substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (SN+), detected by transcranial sonography (TCS), plays an important role in the differential diagnosis of PD. The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictive performance of quantitative SN+ evaluations for LID. Five hundred sixty-two individuals were included in our analysis, and 198 individuals were followed up. These individuals were divided into two groups at baseline: the PD with LID (PD+LID) group and the PD without LID (PD-LID) group. The association between total hyperechogenic area of the SN on both sides (SN",

    "abstract": "The microbiota-gut-brain axis or simple gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex and interactive bidirectional communication network linking the gut to the brain. Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiome have been linked to GBA dysfunction, central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, and dopaminergic degeneration, as those occurring in Parkinson's disease (PD). Besides inflammation, the activation of brain microglia is known to play a central role in the damage of dopaminergic neurons. Inflammation is attributed to the toxic effect of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein, in the brain of PD patients. It has been suggested that the \u03b1-synuclein misfolding might begin in the gut and spread \"prion-like\", via the vagus nerve into the lower brainstem and ultimately to the midbrain, known as the Braak hypothesis. In this review, we discuss how the microbiota-gut-brain axis and environmental influences interact with the immune system to promote a pro-inflammatory state that is involved in the initiation and progression of misfolded \u03b1-synuclein proteins and the beginning of the early non-motor symptoms of PD. Furthermore, we describe a speculative bidirectional model that explains how the enteric glia is involved in the initiation and spreading of inflammation, epithelial barrier disruption, and \u03b1-synuclein misfolding, finally reaching the central nervous system and contributing to neuroinflammatory processes involved with the initial non-motor symptoms of PD.",

    "abstract": "In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), long-term care insurance (LTCI), which can provide physical activity, might affect medical costs and utilization. We investigated the impact of LTCI on medical costs and utilization among patients with PD aged \u226560 years.\nData were derived from the 12-year Korean National Health Insurance Service\u2012Senior cohort. Among patients with newly developed PD, the intervention group receiving LTCI was matched with the control group using propensity score risk-set matching. As medical costs and utilization may increase markedly immediately before LTCI allocation, the baseline period was set from 5 years to 1 year prior to receiving LTCI. Medical costs and utilization were recorded in six 1-year intervals thereafter. We compared medical costs and utilization between groups using a comparative interrupted time-series analysis.\n5011 LTCI beneficiaries and 5011 propensity score- and risk-set-matched controls were included. The overall mean (standard deviation) age was 77.73 (5.7) years, and 66.2% were women, in both groups. LTCI benefit was associated with reduced overall direct medical costs for 5 years (post-intervention year 5: -270$, p\u00a0=\u00a00.033), and overall hospital length-of-stay (LOS) for 2 years post-LTCI (post-intervention year 2: -2.43 days, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), although medical costs and LOS increased immediately pre-LTCI implementation. The long-term care hospital LOS of LTCI beneficiaries increased relatively by 3-years post-LTCI implementation, particularly in those with a high Charlson Comorbidity Index score (post-intervention year 3: +2.65 days, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).\nLTCI benefit stably decreased medical costs for patients with PD for 5 years, despite the steep increase immediately pre-LTCI benefit, but was limited in reducing medical utilization, particularly as reflected by LOS in long-term care hospitals and patients with comorbidities. LTCI could be a useful health policy to reduce PD disease burden. However, further development is required to provide services that can reduce LOS to PD patients with comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive and neuropsychiatric disturbances in Parkinson's disease are as common and as disabling as its well-known motor symptoms. Even though several neural substrates for these symptoms have been suggested, to which extent these symptoms reflect cortical neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease remains to be fully elucidated.\nIn a representative sample of 44 Parkinson's disease patients, the data about the following symptoms was recorded: cognitive performance, apathy, depression and anxiety. Surface-based vertexwise multiple regression analyses were performed to investigate the cortical macro (cortical thinning) and microstructural (increased intracortical diffusivity) correlates of each symptom. A group of 18 healthy controls with similar sociodemographics was also included to assess the disease specificity of the neuroimaging results.\nCompared to healthy controls, Parkinson's disease patients showed significantly increased scores in all the considered non-motor scales (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Within the Parkinson's disease group, increased scores in these scales were associated with cortical macro- and microstructural neurodegeneration (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 corrected). Each of the considered non-motor scales was associated with a specific pattern of cortical degeneration. When observing both neuroimaging techniques, intracortical diffusivity revealed similar but extensive patterns of cortical compromise than cortical thickness for each symptom, with the exception of anxiety.\nCognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease reflect cortical degeneration. Increases in intracortical diffusivity were able to detect symptom-specific cortical microstructural damage in the absence of cortical thinning. A better understanding of this association may contribute to characterize the brain circuitry and the neurotransmitter pathways underlying these highly prevalent and debilitating symptoms in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "There are currently no preventive or disease-modifying therapies for Parkinson's Disease (PD). Failures in clinical trials necessitate a re-evaluation of existing pre-clinical models in order to adopt systems that better recapitulate underlying disease mechanisms and better predict clinical outcomes. In recent years, models utilizing patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) have emerged as attractive models to recapitulate disease-relevant neuropathology in vitro without exogenous overexpression of disease-related pathologic proteins. Here, we utilized iPSC derived from patients with early-onset PD and dementia phenotypes that harbored either a point mutation (A53T) or multiplication at the \u03b1-synuclein/SNCA gene locus. We generated a three-dimensional (3D) cortical neurosphere culture model to better mimic the tissue microenvironment of the brain. We extensively characterized the differentiation process using quantitative PCR, Western immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining. Differentiated and aged neurospheres revealed alterations in fatty acid profiles and elevated total and pathogenic phospho-\u03b1-synuclein levels in both A53T and the triplication lines compared to their isogenic control lines. Furthermore, treatment of the neurospheres with a small molecule inhibitor of stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) attenuated the protein accumulation and aberrant fatty acid profile phenotypes. Our findings suggest that the 3D cortical neurosphere model is a useful tool to interrogate targets for PD and amenable to test small molecule therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous neurotoxin 1-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroiso-quinoline (Salsolinol, SAL) is a dopamine metabolite that is toxic to dopaminergic neurons in vitro and in vivo, and is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the molecular mechanism by which SAL induces neurotoxicity in PD remains challenging for future investigations. This study found that SAL induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and mice. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were used to detect differentially expressed genes in SAL-treated SH-SY5Y cells. We found that NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)-dependent pyroptosis was enriched by SAL, which was validated by in vitro and in vivo SAL models. Further, NLRP3 inflammasome-related genes (ASC, NLRP3, active caspase 1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18) were increased at the mRNA and protein level. Acteoside mitigates SAL-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome-related pyroptosis in in vitro and in vivo PD models. In summary, the present study suggests for the first time that NLRP3-dependent pyroptosis plays a role in the pathogenesis of SAL-induced PD, and acteoside mitigates SAL-induced pyroptosis-dependent neurotoxicity in in vitro and in vivo PD models. The present results demonstrated a new mechanism whereby SAL mediates neurotoxicity by activating NLRP3-dependent pyroptosis, further highlighting SAL-induced pyroptosis-dependent neurotoxicity as a potential therapeutic target in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a second most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective and progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta. Rotenone is a neurotoxin which selectively degenerate dopaminergic neurons in striatum, leading to cause PD like symptoms.\nRotenone was administered at a dose of 1.5\u2009mg/kg, i.p. from day 1 to day 40. Treatment with doxycycline (50 and 100\u2009mg/kg, p.o), tocopherol (5\u2009mg and 10\u2009mg/kg, p.o) alone, doxycycline (50\u2009mg/kg, p.o) in combination with tocopherol (10\u2009mg/kg, p.o), and ropinirole (0.5\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) was given for 40\u2009days 1\u2009h prior to administration of rotenone. All behavioral parameters were analyzed on weekly basis. On day 41, animals were sacrificed and the striatum region was isolated for neurotransmitters estimation (dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA and glutamate), biochemical analysis (GSH, nitrite, LPO, mitochondrial complexes I and IV), inflammatory markers estimation (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) and activity of MAO-A, MAO-B.\nDoxycycline and tocopherol in combination significantly attenuated behavioral, neurotransmitters and biochemical alterations induced by rotenone in experimental rats as compared to alone treatment with DOX and TOCO. Similarly, DOX and TOCO combination significantly reduced the level of inflammatory markers, prevented the biochemical changes, decreased MAO-A and MAO-B and improved complex-I, complex-IV, cAMP levels significantly.\nThe current study revealed that a combination of doxycycline with tocopherol contributed to the prevention of PD like symptoms in rats by antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, MAO inhibitory and neuromodulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Based on the biolabel research pattern, omics and network pharmacology were used for exploring the neuroprotection of Sophora tonkinensis (ST) in the treatment of brain diseases. Multi-omics were applied to investigate biolabels for ST intervention in brain tissue. Based on biolabels, the therapeutic potential, mechanism and material basis of ST for treating brain diseases were topologically analyzed by network pharmacology. A Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model was used to validate biolabel analysis results. Four proteins and three metabolites were involved in two key pathways (alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism and arginine biosynthesis) and considered as biolabels. Network pharmacology showed that ST has the potential to treat some brain diseases, especially PD. Eight compounds (including caffeic acid, gallic acid and cinnamic acid) may serve as the material basis of ST treating brain diseases via the mediation of three biolabels. In the PD model, ST and its active compounds (caffeic acid and gallic acid) may protect dopaminergic neurons (maximum recovery rate for dopamine, 49.5%) from oxidative stress (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase parkin, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, etc.) and neuroexcitatory toxicity (glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamine, glutamic acid, etc.). These findings indicated that omics and network pharmacology may contribute to the achievement of the objectives of this study based on the biolabel research pattern.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making during mixed-strategy games requires flexibly adapting choice strategies in response to others' actions and dynamically tracking outcomes. Such decisions involve diverse cognitive processes, including reinforcement learning, which are affected by disruptions to the striatal dopamine system. We therefore investigated how genetic variation in dopamine function affected mixed-strategy decision-making in Parkinson's disease (PD), which involves striatal dopamine pathology. Sixty-six PD patients (ages 49-85, Hoehn and Yahr Stages 1-3) and 22 healthy controls (ages 54-75) competed in a mixed-strategy game where successful performance depended on minimizing choice biases (i.e., flexibly adapting choices trial by trial). Participants also completed a fixed-strategy task that was matched for sensory input, motor outputs and overall reward rate. Factor analyses were used to disentangle cognitive from motor aspects within both tasks. Using a within-subject, multi-centre design, patients were examined on and off dopaminergic therapy, and genetic variation was examined via a multilocus genetic profile score representing the additive effects of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence dopamine transmission: rs4680 (COMT Val",

    "abstract": "Memory impairment is a hallmark cognitive deficit in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it remains unclear which processes underlie this deficit in PD. Also, little is known on these patients' subjective experiences of memory difficulties and their relationship with objective measures. We aim to portray memory deficits in PD by combining objective and subjective memory measures.\nFifteen PD patients and 15 controls were assessed with an extended version of the Face-Name Associative Memory Exam (FNAME) and the Memory Failures of Everyday Questionnaire (MFE-28). We also explored the relationship among clinical and cognitive variables.\nParticipants with PD presented with more memory complaints. On the FNAME, these patients exhibited lower performance in free recall, as well as in name recognition and matching. Importantly, when controlling for initial learning, group effects disappeared, except for matching. Associative memory therefore was significantly compromised in PD and correlated with subjective memory complaints (SMC).\nOur findings suggest that associative memory may constitute a sensitive measure to detect subtle memory deficits in PD. Moreover, the current study further clarifies the source of memory impairment in PD. Thus, our study highlights the clinical value of including associative memory tests such as the FNAME in PD neuropsychological assessment.",

Dopamine replacement therapy is currently the mainstream treatment, which can alleviate the symptoms but induces motor complications. Acupuncture therapy is effective for PD. As a form of acupuncture, the abdominal acupuncture has been used to relieve symptoms in patients with PD, but its effectiveness and safety have not yet reached a definitive conclusion. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis protocol is planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of abdominal acupuncture for PD patients.\nSix English databases (PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Springer Cochrane Library, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) and 4 Chinese databases (Wan Fang Database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database) will be searched normatively according to the rule of each database from the inception to August 20, 2022. Two reviewers will independently conduct article selection, data collection, and risk of bias evaluation. Any disagreement will be resolved by discussion with the third reviewer. Either the fixed-effects or random-effects model will be used for data synthesis based on the heterogeneity test. Either the fixed-effects or random-effects model will be used for data synthesis based on the heterogeneity test. The analysis will be conducted by RevMan 5.3 software according to Cochrane Handbook.\nThe aim of this systematic review is to provide high-quality evidence to assess the efficacy and safety of abdominal acupuncture for patients in Parkinson's disease. The efficacy and safety of abdominal acupuncture for PD will be comprehensively assessed from the outcomes, including the effectiveness rate.

    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) provides a multivariate framework to detect relevant spatio-oscillatory patterns in the data beyond common mass-univariate statistics. Yet, its practical application is limited due to the low interpretability of the results beyond accuracy. We opted to use DCNN with a minimalistic architecture design and large penalized terms to yield a generalizable and clinically relevant network model. Our network was trained based on the scalp topology of the electroencephalography (EEG) from an open access dataset, constituting our primary sample of healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a025) and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (n\u00a0=\u00a025), with and without medication. Next, we validated the model on another independent, yet comparable open access EEG dataset (healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and PD patients (n\u00a0=\u00a020)), which was unseen to the network. We applied Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) interpretability technique to create a localization map exhibiting the key network predictors, based on the gradients of the classification score flowing into the last convolutional layer. Accordingly, our results indicated that a sub-second of intrinsic oscillatory power pattern in the beta band over the occipitoparietal, gamma band over the left motor cortex as well as theta band over the frontoparietal cluster, had the largest impact on the network score for dissociating the PD patients from age- and gender-matched healthy controls, across the two datasets. We further found that the off-medication motor symptoms were related to the occipitoparietal off-medication beta power whereas the disease duration was associated with the off-medication beta power of the motor cortex. The on-medication theta power of the frontoparietal was related to the improvement of the motor symptoms. In conclusion, our method enabled us to characterize PD patho-electrophysiology according to the multivariate topographic analysis approach, where both spatial and frequency aspects of the oscillations were simultaneously considered. Moreover, our approach was free from common reference problem of the EEG data analyses.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) demonstrates neurodegenerative changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) using neuromelanin-sensitive (NM)-MRI. As SNc manual segmentation is prone to substantial inter-individual variability across raters, development of a robust automatic segmentation framework is necessary to facilitate nigral neuromelanin quantification. Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining traction in the neuroimaging community for automated brain region segmentation tasks using MRI.\nDeveloping and validating AI-based NigraNet, a fully automatic SNc segmentation framework allowing nigral neuromelanin quantification in patients with PD using NM-MRI.\nWe prospectively included 199 participants comprising 144 early-stage idiopathic PD patients (disease duration\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0years) and 55 healthy volunteers (HV) scanned using a 3 Tesla MRI including whole brain T1-weighted anatomical imaging and NM-MRI. The regions of interest (ROI) were delineated in all participants automatically using NigraNet, a modified U-net, and compared to manual segmentations performed by two experienced raters. The SNc volumes (Vol), volumes corrected by total intracranial volume (C\nUsing both methods, Vol, C\nWe presented an AI-based NigraNet framework that utilizes a small MRI training dataset to fully automatize the SNc segmentation procedure with an increased precision and more reproducible results. Considering the consistency, accuracy and speed of our approach, this study could be a crucial step towards the implementation of a time-saving non-rater dependent fully automatic method for studying neuromelanin changes in clinical settings and large-scale neuroimaging studies.",
