    "abstract": "Subcortical volumes are a promising source of biomarkers and features in biosignatures, and automated methods facilitate extracting them in large, phenotypically rich datasets. However, while extensive research has verified that the automated methods produce volumes that are similar to those generated by expert annotation; the consistency of methods with each other is understudied. Using data from the UK Biobank, we compare the estimates of subcortical volumes produced by two popular software suites: FSL and FreeSurfer. Although most subcortical volumes exhibit good to excellent consistency across the methods, the tools produce diverging estimates of amygdalar volume. Through simulation, we show that this poor consistency can lead to conflicting results, where one but not the other tool suggests statistical significance, or where both tools suggest a significant relationship but in opposite directions. Considering these issues, we discuss several ways in which care should be taken when reporting on relationships involving amygdalar volume.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to compare the accuracy and reliability of two segmentation tools for magnetic resonance (MR) volumetry (FreeSurfer and Neurophet AQUA) at two magnetic field strengths (1.5T and 3T). We included 101 patients for the 1.5T-3T dataset and 112 for the 3T-3T dataset from three hospitals and five open-source datasets. The mean volume difference and average volume difference percentage with the change in magnetic field strength were compared between the methods. The hippocampus volume was larger with FreeSurfer than the Neurophet AQUA. In most brain regions, the Neurophet AQUA yielded a smaller average volume difference percentage (all <\u200910%) than FreeSurfer (all >\u200910%). The Neurophet AQUA exhibited more stable connectivity and regularity of the segmented components. Regarding volume, the Neurophet AQUA had effect sizes and ICCs comparable to those of FreeSurfer across the magnetic field strengths. With FreeSurfer, the original volume difference was small, whereas the average volume difference percentage was small with the Neurophet AQUA. Image segmentation took 1\u00a0h with FreeSurfer and 5\u00a0min with the Neurophet AQUA. When choosing an automatic segmentation method, the differences in image processing time and volume variability due to changes in the magnetic field strength of these methods should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Dementia can be caused by numerous different diseases that present variable clinical courses and reveal multiple patterns of brain atrophy, making its accurate early diagnosis by conventional examinative means challenging. Although highly accurate and powerful, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) currently plays only a supportive role in dementia diagnosis, largely due to the enormous volume and diversity of data it generates. AI-based software solutions/algorithms that can perform automated segmentation and volumetry analyses of MRI data are being increasingly used to address this issue. Numerous commercial and non-commercial software solutions for automated brain segmentation and volumetry exist, with FreeSurfer being the most frequently used.\nThis Review is an account of the current situation regarding the application of automated brain segmentation and volumetry to dementia diagnosis.\nWe performed a PubMed search for \u201cFreeSurfer AND Dementia\u201d and obtained 493 results. Based on these search results, we conducted an in-depth source analysis to identify additional publications, software tools, and methods. Studies were analyzed for design, patient collective, and for statistical evaluation (mathematical methods, correlations).\nIn the studies identified, the main diseases and cohorts represented were Alzheimer\u2019s disease (\nOur evaluation showed that, while a large number of studies and software solutions are available, many diseases are underrepresented in terms of their incidence. There is therefore plenty of scope for targeted research.",

    "abstract": "Subcortical volumes are a promising source of biomarkers and features in biosignatures, and automated methods facilitate extracting them in large, phenotypically rich datasets. However, while extensive research has verified that the automated methods produce volumes that are similar to those generated by expert annotation, the consistency of methods with each other is understudied. Using data from the UK Biobank, we compare the estimates of subcortical volumes produced by two popular software suites: FSL and FreeSurfer. Although most subcortical volumes exhibit good to excellent consistency across the methods, the tools produce diverging estimates of amygdalar volume. Through simulation, we show that this poor consistency can lead to conflicting results, where one but not the other tool suggests statistical significance, or where both tools suggest a significant relationship but in opposite directions. Considering these issues, we discuss several ways in which care should be taken when reporting on relationships involving amygdalar volume.",

    "abstract": "The Huntington's Disease Integrated Staging System (HD-ISS) defined disease onset using volumetric cut-offs for caudate and putamen derived from FreeSurfer 6 (FS6). The impact of the latest software update (FS7) on volumes remains unknown. The Huntington's Disease Young Adult Study (HD-YAS) is appropriately positioned to explore differences in FS bias when detecting early atrophy.\nExplore the relationships and differences between raw caudate and putamen volumes, calculated total intracranial volumes (cTICV), and adjusted caudate and putamen volumes, derived from FS6 and FS7, in HD-YAS.\nImages from 123 participants were segmented and quality controlled. Relationships and differences between volumes were explored using intraclass correlation (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis.\nAcross the whole cohort, ICC for raw caudate and putamen was 0.99, cTICV 0.93, adjusted caudate 0.87, and adjusted putamen 0.86 (all p\u200a<\u200a0.0005). Compared to FS6, FS7 calculated: i) larger raw caudate (+0.8%, p\u200a<\u200a0.00005) and putamen (+1.9%, p\u200a<\u200a0.00005), with greater difference for larger volumes; and ii) smaller cTICV (-5.1%, p\u200a<\u200a0.00005), with greater difference for smaller volumes. The systematic and proportional difference in cTICV was greater than raw volumes. When raw volumes were adjusted for cTICV, these effects compounded (adjusted caudate +7.0%, p\u200a<\u200a0.00005; adjusted putamen +8.2%, p\u200a<\u200a0.00005), with greater difference for larger volumes.\nAs new software is released, it is critical that biases are explored since differences have the potential to significantly alter the findings of HD trials. Until conversion factors are defined, the HD-ISS must be applied using FS6. This should be incorporated into the HD-ISS online calculator.",

    "abstract": "To develop and validate a deep learning-based automatic segmentation model for assessing intracranial volume (ICV) and to compare the accuracy determined by NeuroQuant (NQ), FreeSurfer (FS), and SynthSeg.\nThis retrospective study included 60 subjects [30 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 21 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 9 cognitively normal (CN)] from a single tertiary hospital for the training and validation group (50:10). The test group included 40 subjects (20\u2009AD, 10 MCI, 10 CN) from the ADNI dataset. We propose a robust ICV segmentation model based on the foundational 2D UNet architecture trained with four types of input images (both single and multimodality using scaled or unscaled T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR MR images). To compare with our model, NQ, FS, and SynthSeg were also utilized in the test group. We evaluated the model performance by measuring the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and average volume difference.\nThe single-modality model trained with scaled T1-weighted images showed excellent performance with a DSC of 0.989\u2009\u00b1\u20090.002 and an average volume difference of 0.46%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.38%. Our multimodality model trained with both unscaled T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR images showed similar performance with a DSC of 0.988\u2009\u00b1\u20090.002 and an average volume difference of 0.47%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.35%. The overall average volume difference with our model showed relatively higher accuracy than NQ (2.15%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.72%), FS (3.69%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.93%), and SynthSeg (1.88%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.18%). Furthermore, our model outperformed the three others in each subgroup of patients with AD, MCI, and CN subjects.\nOur deep learning-based automatic ICV segmentation model showed excellent performance for the automatic evaluation of ICV.",

    "abstract": "We have studied the effects of manual quality control of brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images processed with Freesurfer. T1 images of first episode psychosis patients (N\u00a0=\u00a060) and healthy controls (N\u00a0=\u00a041) were inspected for gray matter boundary errors. The errors were fixed, and the effects of error correction on brain volume, thickness, and surface area were measured. It is commonplace to apply quality control to Freesurfer MRI recordings to ensure that the edges of gray and white matter are detected properly, as incorrect edge detection leads to changes in variables such as volume, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area. We find that while Freesurfer v7.1.1. does regularly make mistakes in identifying the edges of cortical gray matter, correcting these errors yields limited changes in the commonly measured variables listed above. We further find that the software makes fewer gray matter boundary errors when processing female brains. The results suggest that manually correcting gray matter boundary errors may not be worthwhile due to its small effect on the measurements, with potential exceptions for studies that focus on the areas that are more commonly affected by errors: the areas around the cerebellar tentorium, paracentral lobule, and the optic nerves, specifically the horizontal segment of the middle cerebral artery.",

    "abstract": "On-going, large-scale neuroimaging initiatives can aid in uncovering neurobiological causes and correlates of poor mental health, disease pathology, and many other important conditions. As projects grow in scale with hundreds, even thousands, of individual participants and scans collected, quantification of brain structures by automated algorithms is becoming the only truly tractable approach. Here, we assessed the spatial and numerical reliability for newly deployed automated segmentation of hippocampal subfields and amygdala nuclei in FreeSurfer 7. In a sample of participants with repeated structural imaging scans (N\u2009=\u2009928), we found numerical reliability (as assessed by intraclass correlations, ICCs) was reasonable. Approximately 95% of hippocampal subfields had \"excellent\" numerical reliability (ICCs\u2009\u2265\u20090.90), while only 67% of amygdala subnuclei met this same threshold. In terms of spatial reliability, 58% of hippocampal subfields and 44% of amygdala subnuclei had Dice coefficients\u2009\u2265\u20090.70. Notably, multiple regions had poor numerical and/or spatial reliability. We also examined correlations between spatial reliability and person-level factors (e.g., participant age; T1 image quality). Both sex and image scan quality were related to variations in spatial reliability metrics. Examined collectively, our work suggests caution should be exercised for a few hippocampal subfields and amygdala nuclei with more variable reliability.",

    "abstract": "Automatic neuroimaging processing tools provide convenient and systematic methods for extracting features from brain magnetic resonance imaging scans. One tool, FreeSurfer, provides an easy-to-use pipeline to extract cortical and subcortical morphometric measures. There have been over 25 stable releases of FreeSurfer, with different versions used across published works. The reliability and compatibility of regional morphometric metrics derived from the most recent version releases have yet to be empirically assessed. Here, we used test-retest data from three public data sets to determine within-version reliability and between-version compatibility across 42 regional outputs from FreeSurfer versions 7.1, 6.0, and 5.3. Cortical thickness from v7.1 was less compatible with that of older versions, particularly along the cingulate gyrus, where the lowest version compatibility was observed (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.37-0.61). Surface area of the temporal pole, frontal pole, and medial orbitofrontal cortex, also showed low to moderate version compatibility. We confirm low compatibility between v6.0 and v5.3 of pallidum and putamen volumes, while those from v7.1 were compatible with v6.0. Replication in an independent sample showed largely similar results for measures of surface area and subcortical volumes, but had lower overall regional thickness reliability and compatibility. Batch effect correction may adjust for some inter-version effects when most sites are run with one version, but results vary when more sites are run with different versions. Age associations in a quality controlled independent sample (N\u00a0=\u2009106) revealed version differences in results of downstream statistical analysis. We provide a reference to highlight the regional metrics that may yield recent version-related inconsistencies in published findings.

    "abstract": "Advances in Magnetic Resonance Imaging hardware and methodologies allow for promoting the cortical morphometry with submillimeter spatial resolution. In this paper, we generated 3D self-enhanced high-resolution (HR) MRI imaging, by adapting 1 deep learning architecture, and 3 standard pipelines, FreeSurfer, MaCRUISE, and BrainSuite, have been collectively employed to evaluate the cortical thickness. We systematically investigated the differences in cortical thickness estimation for MRI sequences at multiresolution homologously originated from the native image. It has been revealed that there systematically exhibited the preferences in determining both inner and outer cortical surfaces at higher resolution, yielding most deeper cortical surface placements toward GM/WM or GM/CSF boundaries, which directs a consistent reduction tendency of mean cortical thickness estimation; on the contrary, the lower resolution data will most probably provide a more coarse and rough evaluation in cortical surface reconstruction, resulting in a relatively thicker estimation. Although the differences of cortical thickness estimation at the diverse spatial resolution varied with one another, almost all led to roughly one-sixth to one-fifth significant reduction across the entire brain at the HR, independent to the pipelines we applied, which emphasizes on generally coherent improved accuracy in a data-independent manner and endeavors to cost-efficiency with quantitative opportunities.",
